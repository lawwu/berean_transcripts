God, I just thank you for this time that you've given us to come here tonight to worship you, to hear your words spoken, but also just to study it for ourselves, God, so that we would be people of your word. Lord, we thank you that you've given us this time to praise you in song, and God, I just pray that as we are singing, Lord, we would be reflecting on these lyrics. We would be giving you glory and just point our hearts towards you in this time. I thank you again just for tonight, and I pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen. Can we all stand for a time of worship?    Lord, you're calling me. Lord, you're calling me to come and behold the wondrous cross, to explore the depths of grace that came to me at such a cost, where your boundless love conquered my boundless sin, and mercy's arms were opened wide. My heart is filled with a thousand songs proclaiming the glories of Calvary. With every breath, Lord, how I long to sing of Jesus who died for me. Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary.  Sinners find eternal joy in the triumph of your grace. By our Savior's crimson flow, holy wrath has been removed. Enjoy, saints below. Enjoy with your saints above. Rejoice, singing the risen lamb. My heart is filled with a thousand songs proclaiming the glories of Calvary. With every breath, Lord, how I long to sing of Jesus who died for me. My heart is filled with a thousand songs proclaiming the glories of Calvary. With every breath, Lord, how I long to sing of Jesus who died for me. Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary. For all eternity. For all eternity. We will sing worthy. Our God has set us free. We'll sing the glories of Calvary. For all eternity. We will sing worthy. Our God has set us free. We'll sing the glories of Calvary.   My hope is built. My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.  When darkness fills His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.  His hope is covered, His blood support me in the worldly fight. When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.  When He shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in Him be found. Trusting His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. You may be seated. Alright, good evening to everybody. As I shared last week, verses 3 to 12 is one sentence, but we broke it down and I added verse 13 because this is one of the most important therefores in the New Testament. So I wanted your brain naturally to go immediately to, oh there's an expectation on how Christians are supposed to respond. So let me read these four verses for you and then I'll show you what the group discussion questions are. As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preach the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Things into which angels long to look. Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, and fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As per usual, we're going to be looking through just your findings on those four verses. So questions one and two are going to be the same. And each verse, someone came up to me earlier today and was like, "You know, I try to memorize these four verses but they were so long." I was like, "Yeah." So it's almost the equivalent of like seven or eight verses in terms of like sentence length. But do your best to just share the observations that you made. This isn't a time where you're coming to learn, you're coming more to encourage others with what you've learned. And if you do have time, which I doubt you'll have a lot of it at the end of those four verses, bonus question is what role does the Old Testament play in the Christian life? And what areas of faith, of life, and theology are enhanced by the careful study of the Old Testament? And this question is going to be important as we track through sections of 1 Peter. And it's good to just start thinking through this now. Okay? So those are the questions. And at 820, we're going to resume and then we're going to go into a time of reflection and wrap up. But let me pray for us and then we'll resume at 820. Lord, we are very just a corrupted people that even when we study the beauty of this gift of salvation, it may often lead just to just knowledge without just a humbling and a gratefulness. And so we do pray, Father, that You would guard us, guard our hearts from becoming smug or indifferent as we study this passage, but to be humbled that You would call us to join Your family through these means. I pray that You would help all of us as we study this, that we would be in awe. That we would be healthily terrified and that we would be able to make the proper application so that we might appropriately respond to this wonderful gift. So I pray for each small group that You would lead the time and that You would help us to crave and want for more through our study. So would You guide, guard, and protect the next hour as we discuss? And we entrust this time into Your hands. In Jesus' name we pray. We'll see you guys at 820.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I will confess to you that when ministry is at its sweetest, is when I don't care about what people think, and when I'm just engrossed in, like, the goodness of God. But ministry becomes a job when I'm distracted by the affairs of this world. And I'm sure for you it's similar, right? Loving God, loving the church, serving His people, building His kingdom. It's easier when you're obsessed with God, and you're not really hopeful about this life. But when you get that promotion, when you buy that house, all kinds of distractions happen. So we need to be sober in spirit, okay? We need to fight for that. And just to remind us of the preciousness of this ginormous, spiritual, cosmic baton pass, I want to read you guys a passage. And I want to just have you guys just think through, in light of what we talked about tonight, just these verses, okay? "What more shall I say? For time will fail me "if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, "of David, and Samuel, and the prophets, "who by faith conquered kingdoms, "performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, "shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, "escaped the edge of the sword from weakness, "were made strong, became mighty in war, "put foreign armies to fight. "Women received back their dead by resurrection, "and others were tortured, not accepting their release, "so that they might obtain a better resurrection. "And others experienced mockings and scourgings, "but also chains and imprisonment. "They were stoned, they were sawn in two, "they were tempted, they were put to death with a sword. "They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, "being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated, "men of whom the world was not worthy, "wandering in deserts and mountains and caves "and holes in the ground." And I'm thinking these are the prophets, okay? "And all these, having gained approval through their faith,</p></div></body></html>
