As we begin our service, may it be our prayer to have such a faith that has been tried and proven through even our present trials, a faith that has been purified of any sin and any other desire, but a wholehearted devotion to the Lord, a solid faith that would be to us more precious than gold and be to God's praise and glory. Purify my heart. Let me be as gold and precious silver. Purify my heart. Let me be as gold, pure gold. My heart's one desire is to be holy, set apart from the world. Pure gold we find is found.
