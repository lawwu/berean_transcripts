class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1676">00:27:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's going to come a time, if not pretty soon, where nominal Christianity is not going to be an option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1685">00:28:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like in China now, they made an official edict that in the churches they have to hang a picture of Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1694">00:28:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and to acknowledge them as their ultimate authority, or else they're not going to get social help from the government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1703">00:28:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they made that clear, and again the persecution has been increasing there, but more and more we see signs of that beginning to happen in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1712">00:28:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So this casual church attendance, I think at some point, is going to go out the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1718">00:28:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">People who just grew up in the church and happen to go to church will be forced to make a decision where you stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1725">00:28:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And nominal Christianity will not, I think, when persecution comes, is not going to be an option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1732">00:28:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the benefits of persecution causes Christians, whether nominal or true, to ask the question, "Where do I stand with Christ?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1742">00:29:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It causes us to count the cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1745">00:29:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you and I live in a generation where the churches have worked extra hard to make it as easy as possible for as many people to come to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1755">00:29:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result of that, the gospel has been watered down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1759">00:29:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything offensive, anything that doesn't sit right, anything that goes against our culture, the sharp edges have been taken out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1768">00:29:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have masses of people who are attending churches and have never really asked the question, "Do I really believe this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1776">00:29:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And when the Bible tells us to count the cost, we have churches filled with people who have never seriously considered that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1785">00:29:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the benefit of persecution, persecution forces us to take a step back and take a hard look at what it is that we believe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1793">00:29:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the consequences of our belief, and causes us to make a stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1798">00:29:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I believe this or do I not believe this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1801">00:30:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I say all of this is because the book of Hebrews is written in that same spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1807">00:30:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The first generation of Christians, they didn't know what Christianity was, and all they knew was there's something new swept the land,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1815">00:30:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of a sudden there's this hope of eternal life, and if you believe in Jesus Christ, you're going to have eternity secure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1822">00:30:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was some pushback from the secular world, there was some pushback from the Jewish community,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1827">00:30:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but for the most part, it was just something new and novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1831">00:30:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this church that the author is writing to, initially was excited, initially they participated in this growth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1840">00:30:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but now, about 20 to 30 years removed from that, Nero's persecution most likely is in full swing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1848">00:30:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of the leaders are being beheaded, crucified, people are being dragged into the Colosseum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1854">00:30:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and in the midst of that, some of them were beginning to slide back into their old life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1860">00:31:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, they didn't outright deny Christ, they didn't say, "You know, we don't believe this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1867">00:31:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They were trying to synchrotize their past with the new things that they were learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1871">00:31:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and so the whole point of what he says about Jesus being superior to angels, to Moses, to the sacrificial system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1878">00:31:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he's the greatest high priest, he has better sacrifice, better tabernacle, all of it is to really ask the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1886">00:31:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"Are you going to follow Christ, or are you going to drift back into the world?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1892">00:31:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The text that we're looking at, even though it is not stated in the form of a question, but that's actually what he's doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1898">00:31:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he's asking the question, "Now that there are serious consequences for being a Christian,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1903">00:31:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is Jesus better than whatever it is that you are placing your hope in?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1908">00:31:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's three things that I want to highlight in what he says today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1912">00:31:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Verses 11 and 12, he's really asking that question in a statement form, he's asking the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1918">00:31:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"Is Jesus better than anything that you have?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1921">00:32:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, Jesus is better because he delivers us from empty works, from dead works, verses 13 and 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1928">00:32:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then verse 14, Jesus frees us to serve the living God. Those are the three things that we want to be looking at this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1935">00:32:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that he says in verse 11 and 12, that Jesus is better high priest, he's the better sacrifice, in a better tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1944">00:32:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we didn't practice the tabernacle, we're not from the Jewish community, so we may look at that and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1952">00:32:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, that's good to know, but I don't know if there's any practical application here because we never struggled with the tabernacle being better."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1960">00:32:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1962">00:32:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you understand why the tabernacle was created in the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1966">00:32:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole purpose of the tabernacle and the sacrificial system was to do two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1971">00:32:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">One, is to reveal man's sin, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1975">00:32:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that we would know that God is holy and that we would know how sinful we are, so that sin would become utterly sinful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1984">00:33:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then two, to point to the only solution to our sins is the atonement of Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1990">00:33:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was created for those two reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1992">00:33:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">To teach us who we are and who God is, and then to give us a solution in Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=1998">00:33:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But by the time that this is being written, the tabernacle became nothing more than religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2004">00:33:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, at the core of every community, if you go back and if you travel anywhere in the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2010">00:33:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if you go back 30, 40, 50 years, and maybe in some cultures even to this day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2016">00:33:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see what religion means to most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2019">00:33:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember the first time I went to China, I think it was in 1991.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2024">00:33:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, was

to Shanghai,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32uDq09ipC8&t=2047">00:34:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we would go to these obscure cities that
