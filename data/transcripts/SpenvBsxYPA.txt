[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.500]   In the sight of the world, we fly, hold me still, we hold you.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:28.600]   Jesus, the Father, to the Lord, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:47.200]   Jesus, the Father, to the Lord, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still, we're welcome as a Savior, hold me still.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   Amen.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   Amen.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:46.780]   Thank you.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:02:16.760]   Thank you.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:46.740]   Thank you.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:03:16.720]   Thank you.

[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Thank you.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Thank you.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.300]   We're a church family.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.220]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.100]   We will now begin our service.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   We will now begin our service.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.060]   Sing, teach me your way.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:27.500]   Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   Show me your path, O Lord, for I am devoted to you.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Purify my heart's desire, I long to be your servant.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   Give me an undivided heart, no other God, no other love, no other God's before you.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   Teach me, teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   Show me your path, O Lord, and I will walk in your path.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   Show me your path, O Lord, and I will walk in your path, O Lord.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   Show me your path, O Lord, bright and divine to you.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   Purify my heart's desire, I long to be your servant.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.

[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   No other Lord, no other God's before you.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   All right, good morning.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   Welcome to Green Community Church.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   Let me get a few announcements started.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   First of all, as you guys know, this week we have our All Church Praise and Prayer.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   And so because of that, we won't be having our regular Bible study,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   whether home groups or small groups.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   So please come to the church by 7:30 or a little bit earlier than that,
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500]   so we can get started right on time.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   That's coming Friday.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   Women's Ministry Tea Time.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   It's scheduled for April 5th on Saturday, 9:30 to 12:00 p.m.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   So they're telling me that today is the last day that you can sign up.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   So if you're planning to come, please sign up.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   And then spring membership class.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   So the last session of membership class was finished.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   The next session is starting on April 27th, 9:30.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.500]   So if you are planning to become a member, please sign up for that.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   And it's an eight-week course at 9:30 at the Youth Chapel.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   Passover meal.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   If you haven't participated in the Passover meal,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   or even if you had and you want to reinforce that to yourself or to your children,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   that's happening on April 17th, the Thursday of Passion Week at 6:30 at the Fellowship Hall.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   There's a small cost involved with that because dinner is provided.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   So please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.500]   The space is limited.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   It's going to be, I think, about 140, I forget.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500]   But please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   And lastly, on April 12th at 7:00 p.m., there's going to be a cafe gospel night.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   And so if you have friends, family, co-workers that you want to invite
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   where you can meet with outreach team or one of the leaders to be able to share the gospel with them,
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   that's what that night is for.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   So please, if you are planning to, please sign up for that and let them know that you are planning to bring somebody for that.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   And that's happening on April 12th, okay?
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   That's a Saturday before the Passion Week.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   All right, that's all we have.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   Let me pray for our offering.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   Again, if you have a physical offering, there is an offering box in the back that you can give.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   Father, we thank you for today.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   We thank you for your continued grace that you pour upon us,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   that many things that we are aware of and many things that we are not.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   Help us, Lord God, to give you true worship.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   We pray, Father God, that whatever worries or concerns that we may have been entangled with,
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   that your grace truly would be sufficient for us.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:02.500]   Help us to lift our eyes to the throne of Christ, knowing that this is where we find our refuge and help.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   I pray, Father God, that our giving would be a reflection of your tremendous love and grace that you've given us,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   that we would give cheerfully, we would give bountifully.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   And may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:50.480]   Thank you.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:11:13.780]   Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:43.760]   Let us all rise and let's start a few moments.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   Let's sing, I stand amazed, I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   And wonder how he could love me, a sinner condemned, a queen.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   How marvelous, how marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   How marvelous, how marvelous, how marvelous is my Savior's love for me.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   He took my sins, He took my sins.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   He took my sins and my sorrows.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.760]   He made them His very own.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   He bore the burden to Calvary and suffered and died alone.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.760]   He took my sins.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   He took my sins and my sorrows.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   He took my sins and my sorrows.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   He made them His very own.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   He bore the burden to Calvary and suffered and died alone.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   How marvelous, how marvelous, how marvelous, how marvelous.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   How marvelous, how marvelous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   How marvelous, how marvelous, how marvelous, how marvelous is my Savior's love for me.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:45.440]   But with the grants of death glory, His face I am last shall see.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:15:00.200]   To be my joy through the ages, To sing others' love for me.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:15.120]   How marvelous, how wonderful, And my song shall ever be.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:28.880]   How marvelous, how wonderful is, My Savior's love for me.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   How marvelous, how marvelous, How wonderful is, My Savior's love for me.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:56.400]   How marvelous, how marvelous, How marvelous, How wonderful is, My Savior's love for me.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:10.160]   How marvelous, how marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:23.920]   How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   How marvelous, how marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous, How marvelous.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:59.020]   Jesus, your mercy is all my truth. I have no defense, my guilt runs too deep. The best of my works pierced your hands, I'm not free. Jesus, your mercy is all my truth.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:22.380]   Jesus, your mercy is all my truth. I promise I claim the grounds of my hope. Whatever I lack, it's still where I live.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.340]   Jesus, your mercy is all my truth.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:49.280]   Praise the King who bore my sin, took my place when I set contempt. Oh, how great you've always been to me.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.180]   I will sing of your love. Sing.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:04.080]   Jesus, your mercy is all my truth.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   Jesus, your mercy is all my truth.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.900]   Praise the King who bore my sin, took my place when I stood contempt. Oh, how great you've always been to me. Oh, how great you've always been to me. Oh, how great you've always been to me. Oh, how great you've always been to me. Oh, how great you've always been to me. Oh.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:35.480]   in death, Jesus your mercy is all my name, great the King who bore my sin, took my place
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:46.880]   when I stood condemned, oh how could you always sin to me, I will see no
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:19:16.860]   grace, Jesus your mercy is all my joy, forever I'll lift my heart and
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:46.840]   my voice, to see our treasure no power can destroy, Jesus your mercy is all my joy, praise the King who bore my sin, took my place when I stood condemned, oh how could you always
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:20:16.820]   praise the King who bore my sin, took my place when I stood condemned, oh how could you always sin to me, I will sing of your mercy.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:39.800]   With me to Luke chapter 11, we're going to be reading from 1 through 4.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:21:16.780]   Luke chapter 11, verses 1 through 4.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:36.340]   Let's pray, Father we pray for your Holy Spirit to illuminate our minds and our heart, Lord God, to understand your will, help us Lord to be surrendered to you, that we would not simply be hearers of the word, but be doers, in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:22:07.620]   Again, as you know, amen.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:23.340]   Maybe they're doing the truth, maybe they're doing the truth, maybe they're doing the truth, maybe they're doing the truth, maybe they're doing the right things, but if you are not devoted to prayer, we cannot say confidently that we are a healthy church, a healthy church at the center of it, we must have devoted prayer, whether it is as a church or individually.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:41.380]   When you evaluate revivals and certain movements that come in, we always have to caution, especially those of you who are young, because whenever there is a large crowd of people moving a certain direction, we naturally think that this is a movement maybe from God, especially if it has a certain tag attached to it.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:49.300]   But when you study church history, at the core of every revival, every movement of God, there is devoted prayer.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   Prayer is what leads to powerful preaching, powerful preaching leads to holy living, and holy living is what leads to genuine conversion.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   So just because we have the right thinking, that doesn't mean it's a movement of God.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.460]   Just because we have large groups of people that are coming to church doesn't mean that it's a movement of God.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:24.700]   If you study 2,000 years of church history, where there was genuine revival, a powerful presence of God that brought his glory to the forefront, it was always, always, at the center of it was a group of people who were devoted to prayer.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.980]   And prayer would begin to spread.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.160]   That would empower people to preach with boldness.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.180]   And then the preaching of boldness would lead to holy living, conviction of sin.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.580]   And then that would lead to evangelism and mission work.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.100]   And it is always that way.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.180]   You can't point to a single movement where those things were not in place.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.180]   And we can say confidently that that was a movement of God.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:56.220]   Again, I can't emphasize enough how important this is because it is a weak spot in the Western church as a whole, which we are a part of.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:01.940]   There are certain parts of the world where the prayer is emphasized and right doctrine is not.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:10.240]   So they are in dire need of right teaching in many parts of the world where if you ask them what is the greatest need, they would say we need more teaching.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:20.440]   In the Western church, not to say that the teaching, we have too much of the teaching, but I would say the weakness of the Western church is lack of prayer.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:34.160]   It is imperative that any movement of God, if it is not coupled, and if we can't pinpoint and say it's because we prayed, it's just an answer to prayer.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:41.100]   That whatever success or whatever fruit that you see may be the beginning of your ruin.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:53.280]   Because whatever success that you think, if you think that the church is growing because you've applied certain methods, or you have the right teachers, or you figured out something that the other people did not know,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:01.700]   automatically you think, if I can apply this method, if I can apply this knowledge, if I can just teach more people this, that revival will break out.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:20.980]   So prayer is when the people of God recognizes that we are desperate for Him, and that's why His house is called, not a house of teaching, not a house of gathering, not a house of discipleship,
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.880]   but it's called house of prayer, but it's called house of prayer, first and foremost.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:35.520]   That until the people of God recognize that we are desperate, until we ignite Him, until we come to Him, everything that we do may actually end up hurting us.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.940]   All the theology that you are learning may actually end up hurting you.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:48.880]   All the teaching, all the disciplines, all the hard work may end up hurting you, because it will fill you with pride, because you think that you did it without God.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.140]   Prayer is at the heart of who we are.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:26:02.940]   So anything that we do, any success that we experience without prayer, will ultimately lead to the downfall of ourselves and the church.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.780]   Again, I can't emphasize enough, and I am not speaking in hyperbole.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.700]   Look at the scripture.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:15.920]   God will oftentimes bring hardship in our life deliberately, so that we can pray.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.560]   Anything good or bad that comes into our life, God's ultimate purpose is single.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.940]   It's single-minded.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.700]   He wants us to come to Him.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.340]   That's His primary thing.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:37.020]   Not to make sure that everybody's behaving a certain way, which is important, that everybody is thinking a certain way or talking a certain way.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.480]   Everything He does is to bring us to Him.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:48.220]   So a church that does not pray, no matter how it looks on the outside, is in danger.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:56.200]   This is the reason why I believe that the disciples, of all the things that they could have asked Jesus, I mean, think about what Jesus did.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.320]   He raised people from the dead.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.380]   He walked on water.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.500]   He fed the 5,000 miraculously.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.020]   You know, of all the things that are recorded in the scripture where the disciples ask, He says, teach us how to pray.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:15.700]   We're told in this text that they were asking because they remember that John the Baptist did this.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.100]   And so, as John did, Lord, teach us how to pray.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.460]   And I think the reason why, one of the reasons why they asked is because the emphasis of Christ on prayer.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:33.900]   You look at Jesus' life and how often He would break away in deep prayer before His Father.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.300]   So the disciples were not unaware of this.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.280]   So where is He getting this power?
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.900]   He looks like us.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.880]   He talks like us.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.960]   He eats like us.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.220]   But where is His power coming from?
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.780]   So I believe that in observation, they're looking at Jesus and saying, teach us how to pray.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:59.500]   Not only that, there's an intimacy between Jesus and the Father that they did not understand.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:08.860]   So another reason why I believe that they were asking Jesus how to pray, they were basically asking Jesus, teach us how to get to the Father.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:16.160]   Because prior to Christ, we had people who prayed, but they all had to pray in distance.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.340]   Because in the old covenant, a sinner could not confidently come to His presence.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.580]   There was a natural fear that was in the midst of the community.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:35.520]   So they saw this intimacy with Jesus that they probably didn't see with any other prophet or anything that they've read or anything that they've heard of.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:42.240]   And looking at all the evidence of who He is, they probably asked Him, Lord, teach us how to pray.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.260]   So praying is this significant.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:58.060]   No matter where you are in your walk with God, if the hardship that comes into your life doesn't lead to praying, something is wrong with your theology.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.860]   If whatever you are passionate about, this needs to get out, this needs to change.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:08.800]   But that doesn't lead you to first and foremost to get on your knees and cry out to God.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.480]   There's something wrong with your theology.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:25.020]   If you want a movement of God, if you want to see revival happening, and that doesn't cause you to gather together, to be devoted to praying and fasting, there's something that is missing in your theology.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:40.580]   It could easily be the work of our enemy to get you to get you to be distracted, thinking that somehow if you put your know-how, if you put your knowledge, if you put your effort, that something can happen.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.020]   That God was waiting for you to wake up.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:54.120]   So first and foremost, we have to be a house of prayer.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.240]   Before anything else, we have to be praying people.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.840]   And because we recognize that this is a weakness of ours, we keep emphasizing this.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.120]   Because this is not something that, oh, I hope we can get better.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.060]   We have to.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.860]   There should be a sense of urgency.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:16.360]   If I'm coming up here in every single week, I don't even open up the Bible, I think the complaints are going to come.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.640]   You know, the word of God is not preparing.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.880]   There's no word of God being taught, or it's not accurate.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.720]   There's going to be grumbling and complaining.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.500]   Because you already know in your paradigm that the word of God has to be the center of the church.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:34.880]   But there should also be equal concern and urgency when we are not praying in our lives and in the church.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.220]   So we need to pray.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.320]   And we need to come before the Lord and ask Him the same question.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.380]   Lord, how do you pray?
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.880]   Help me to become a better prayer warrior.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.620]   I'm going to be looking at this text this morning.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:54.900]   And a more fuller version, or complete version of this, is found in Matthew chapter 6.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.380]   But we're going to be focused on Luke's text.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.680]   I believe that the Holy Spirit is the author, so it's not like, oh, this is not complete, so we need to find a complete version.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:10.940]   There's a reason why the Holy Spirit chose to give us this version of it in the Gospel of Luke, so we're going to be focused on that.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:20.380]   One thing that we need to caution, before we even jump in, is that this is not, what Jesus is teaching here is not a prayer.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:30.900]   Meaning that if you just say the right words, and if you just follow this, like what He says, that God's going to answer our prayers.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.040]   No, He's teaching us, He's not teaching us a prayer, right?
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.980]   He's teaching us a pattern of prayer.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:43.880]   So what He is telling us is, these are the principles, these are the things that you need to know before you come to God in prayer.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.180]   So this prayer can be divided into two parts.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:53.940]   There's a horizontal relationship with God, and then the second part of it is the, is a vertical relationship.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.540]   Sorry, vertical, I got this wrong.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.400]   Okay, vertical relationship with God, and then horizontal with other people, myself and with other people.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.100]   We're going to be focused today on the vertical relationship, and then this Friday, when we have our praise and prayer,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.440]   I'm going to be doing the part two of this in the horizontal relationship.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:19.180]   First and foremost, He begins by saying, pray, when you pray, say, Father, hallowed be your name.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:26.540]   Now, right off the bat, if you know the Lord's Prayer, we know, everybody knows, Father, we address Him as Father.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.920]   This is not a common way that a Jew would address God.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.740]   So right off the bat, when Jesus says, pray to Him as Father, it would have stopped.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.400]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.840]   You want us to call Him our Father?
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.800]   And it's not because the term Father was not used.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:51.520]   In the Old Testament, God is addressed as Father, but always, 100% of the time, it was referred to as a nation, that He is the Father of Israel.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.620]   However, is it a personal, relational, personal reference to God?
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.480]   Only when you come to the New Testament, where we see a more personal reference to Him.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:14.440]   The word Father, reference to God, in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke, is used 65 times, and in the Gospel of John, it is used 100 times.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.400]   In fact, Jesus exclusively uses the term Father when He addresses God.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:29.900]   The only time that He does not use the reference Father to address God is when He's hanging on the cross, when He says, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:36.260]   Outside of that, 60 other times when He's referring to God, He always addresses Him as Father.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.560]   Now, why is this so important?
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.380]   Why is this so important?
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:49.540]   Because the way we talk to somebody is very different, depending on who they are in our lives.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:56.500]   How a parent talks to the child is different than the way a child will talk to the parent.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.940]   There are things that a parent can say to a child that a child cannot say to parents.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   Somebody in authority, or maybe you're the boss.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.080]   So, knowing who it is that we are speaking to, that we're not just imagining who we're talking to,
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.220]   that first and foremost, He's not just some beings, He's not some power that we're trying to tap into,
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:23.600]   that if we can somehow say the right words and do the right things, that we can get His power to come and to address our present situation.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.300]   He says, first and foremost, that it is our Father that we are addressing.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.620]   Does that change anything?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.500]   Of course it does.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.600]   It changes radically.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:40.340]   How my children address me and how just random people that I meet on the street address me is very different.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.400]   There's things that they can ask that other people cannot ask.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   If a random person comes, I don't know them, they say, can I borrow your car?
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.080]   Right?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.800]   It's like, who are you?
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.980]   Are you going to get it back to me?
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.420]   You wouldn't ask that.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.240]   A normal person wouldn't just ask a random person to do them a favor.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.120]   My children can ask me that.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.400]   It's like, can I use the office?
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.160]   I have soda in my office.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   It's like, can I grab one?
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.120]   Of course you can grab one.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:14.940]   First and foremost, He says, our salvation wasn't simply to prevent us from judgment.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.720]   Although, that is a huge benefit, obviously.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:23.500]   He says, He did it so that He can bring us and to become His children.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:29.200]   In John 1, 12 to 13, but as many as received, and to them He gave the right to become children of God.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.440]   Not to simply be preserved from damnation, but to be children of God.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.680]   Romans 8, 15.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:44.940]   For you have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons and daughters, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.360]   He's not just any father.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.320]   He's Abba, Father.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:55.200]   And I think many of you know that Abba is the Aramaic term for the word father, and it is an intimate word.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.740]   Not just a father, but the father, my father.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.020]   Abba, right?
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.440]   In many languages, the word Abba is used to refer to father.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.800]   I think it's because that's maybe the first sound, maybe that comes out of the mouth.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.320]   You know what the Aramaic word for mother is?
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:14.980]   Uma.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.420]   So those of you who know Korean, right?
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.200]   It's Abba, Uma.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.580]   It's the Aramaic term for father and mother.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.280]   And it is a very intimate term.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:33.600]   So not only, He says, when you come to address Him, to recognize that this is a loving father.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.680]   That you're addressing.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:46.800]   Now, if you understand what He's trying to say here, first and foremost, right off the bat, when you come to Him, know that this is your father that you're coming to.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.040]   He's no longer way up in the distance.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.800]   He's not just a being who's powerful, who can answer your prayers.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:01.020]   But this is a father that gave His only begotten son to adopt you as His child.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.460]   In Romans 8, 16, 17, the Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.540]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.120]   That everything that belonged to Christ, He says, we become fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.040]   Isn't that mind-blowing?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.800]   He said, when Jesus Christ was crucified and was resurrected, He was the first fruit.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.520]   Meaning that He paved the way that the path that He went, we're going to be following.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.240]   And as He was exalted, we will be exalted with Him.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.300]   As He is the heir of God, He says, we will be co-heirs with Christ.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.500]   And it is this Father, this Abba Father, that you are coming to address.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.140]   Does that change the way that we speak to Him?
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.960]   Of course it does.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.600]   And that's why we can come to Him in confidence, because we're not just coming to a being.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.160]   We're not just coming to a holy mountain.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.200]   We're coming to our Father's house.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.920]   He desires to listen to us.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.740]   He wants to give us good things.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.220]   He's not a schoolmaster who's saying that if you do all these right things,
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.940]   and if you get an A, then I'll give you what you want.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.760]   His default setting, because He is our Father, He desires what's good for you.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.000]   Those of you who are parents know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.920]   And I don't think you need to be a parent to know this.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.760]   What makes us that?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.480]   The moment that you become a father or a mother,
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:38.160]   you know, what's the happiest thing that a newly parent experiences?
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.360]   Like an infant getting up and, you know, cooking you something.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.780]   Does that make you happy?
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.800]   You think that'll make you happy?
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.000]   Like one day if I invest in him, he's going to grow up, make a lot of money,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.280]   and he's going to buy me a new car.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.700]   Is that what's making you happy?
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.300]   All the child does is say, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.880]   It may just be gas, but whatever it is,
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.540]   just the fact that they're laughing,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.600]   just the fact that they're happy makes you happy.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.400]   Right?
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.420]   Yeah, it's just, you're just related.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:13.740]   Because someone that you love is experiencing joy.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:19.640]   Every mother, every father experiences that when a child comes.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.980]   That's a blessing of experiencing parenthood.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.200]   So that's our Abba Father.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.860]   That when you come to address Him,
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.420]   He, who did not spare His own son,
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.660]   but gave Him up for us all.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.520]   How will He not along with Him?
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.220]   Give Him everything.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.700]   If He loved you that much to make you His adopted children,
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.020]   and He's our Abba Father.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.740]   He tells us to call Him Abba Father.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.440]   What does He mean by that, call Him Abba Father?
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.980]   Is it just, from now on, I want you to address me this way?
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.680]   Is that what He's saying?
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.420]   When He's saying, come, call me Abba Father.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.560]   That's an invitation to come to me.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.780]   It's an expression of His love.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.880]   I'm your Abba Father.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.100]   I want to give what is best to you.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.120]   That's what that means.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.800]   That's why it says in Matthew 6, 26, He says,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.460]   Look at the birds of the sky that do not sow, nor weep,
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.220]   nor gather crops into barns,
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.980]   and yet our Heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.180]   Are you not much more important than they?
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.460]   In Matthew 7, 11,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.120]   So if you, despite being evil,
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.920]   know how to give gifts to your children,
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.800]   how much more will your Father,
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.700]   who is in heaven,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.120]   give good things to those who ask Him?
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.540]   He is desiring.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.220]   And the only reason why He may not give you something
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.800]   is because it may be harmful to you.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.200]   He does not withhold anything good
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.560]   if it is actually good.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.740]   It's just that sometimes we don't,
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.700]   we're not able to discern that it's good.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.260]   And so He gives us good things.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.540]   Before I became a Christian,
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.600]   somebody would ask me,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.580]   like, do you believe in God?
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.060]   I would say, yes, I believe in God.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.640]   Because I grew up in the church.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.520]   My dad was a pastor.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.820]   My grandfather was a pastor.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.700]   All my childhood memory
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.180]   was in the context of the church.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.760]   But before I met Christ,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.300]   if you asked me, do you believe in God?
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.080]   I would say, yes.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.640]   But He was not my Abba Father.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.940]   There was no intimacy.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.260]   There was no desire to go to Him.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.500]   I just believed that something existed,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.760]   that maybe when I die,
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.560]   I'm going to meet Him.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   That's about the extent of what I believed.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.340]   But when I met Him,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.260]   the first thing I remember
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.920]   is how dirty that I felt in His presence.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.060]   How dirty I was.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.920]   And nobody told me.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.940]   I knew I was a sinner.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.860]   I just felt dirty.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.200]   And then the second,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   that what overwhelmed me is His love.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.120]   That despite this filthiness,
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.180]   that He is willing to cover over my sins,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.560]   and that now this God,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.240]   this being that I've always known existed,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.800]   He loves me.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.100]   And He became my Abba Father.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.500]   Not simply because of deep theological learning
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.020]   or something,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.520]   some powerful message.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.480]   it's just being in His presence.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.560]   I recognize this.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.220]   That's what changed me.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.300]   And I'm pretty sure that's what changed you.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.680]   He says,
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.800]   when you first come to Him,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.060]   recognize He is your Abba Father.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.460]   It is not a duty.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.960]   It is not to come to Him with a check-off list.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.460]   He desires us.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.140]   Oftentimes we don't pray
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.780]   because we feel like there's nothing urgent to pray.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.280]   We didn't make a list of things
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.200]   that I need to pray for.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.040]   So we go there,
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.240]   and I don't have anything to say.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.740]   So therefore, I don't pray.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.900]   Imagine if the only time
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.740]   that you get together with a friend
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.820]   is if you have a list of agenda to cover.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.200]   And you have this agenda
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.020]   that I've got to go through.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.680]   Say, hey, Jack, let's meet together.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.040]   And here's, number one, right?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.220]   I need your help with my car.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.380]   Number two, I need your,
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.120]   I'm hungry.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.960]   Can you feed me?
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.380]   And then number three,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.700]   you know, I have these problems.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.840]   Can you help me with this?
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.400]   And imagine if the only time
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.500]   that you met with a friend
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.340]   was because you have an agenda
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.260]   that you need to cover.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.680]   You know, the people that you feel the most loved,
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.620]   the most comfortable with
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.300]   are people that you don't need to say anything.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.400]   You can be in the car,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.740]   just be quiet the whole time.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.680]   And just being with them,
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.600]   you know what I mean?
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.820]   Makes you happy.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.780]   So I'm not saying that you come to prayer
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.480]   and you don't have to say anything.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.560]   But oftentimes what prevents us from praying
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.340]   is because we don't know what to pray for.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.520]   He said, first and foremost,
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.620]   he says, he's your father.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.060]   You don't have to have an agenda
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.140]   to be with your father.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.860]   You don't have to be in trouble
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.040]   to be with your father.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   You don't have to have a list of things
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.760]   that you need to come and petition
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.180]   to be with your father
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.480]   because that's your father.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.280]   Your father will rejoice
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.460]   simply because you want to be with him.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.860]   Remember he's your father.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.140]   And then he says,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.980]   as you address him as father,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.520]   he says,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.740]   hallowed be your name.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.700]   Hallowed be your name.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.380]   Hallowed basically means holy, honored, reverence.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.120]   You know, as I mentioned,
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.300]   Hebrew is an Asian culture, right?
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.780]   And Greek is a Western culture.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.380]   So if you're Asian American,
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.280]   you kind of have the best of both worlds, right?
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.220]   You're able to understand.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.740]   Although majority of you were born
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.520]   and raised in the United States, right?
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.900]   So you may understand the Western culture
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.440]   a little bit better.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.840]   But understand that Hebrew
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.000]   and much of two-thirds of the Bible
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.400]   was written in the context
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.640]   of an Asian mindset,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.860]   which is very honorific, right?
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.780]   So he says,
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.920]   yes, he's your father,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.960]   but he's your father.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.980]   Recognize that he is your father.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.140]   He's the holy, holy, holy God.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:48.520]   Now, if we do one without the other,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.340]   you're not going to have
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.920]   a correct understanding
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.200]   or relationship with God.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.240]   So either you are in terror of God
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.160]   and you're afraid to go to him
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.080]   because you're afraid
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.040]   you're going to say the wrong things
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.840]   or do the wrong things,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.580]   so therefore you kind of keep a distance.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.600]   Or you have the other end
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.540]   where you said God is just,
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.420]   you know, like mundane,
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.320]   just like everybody else.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.880]   And I remember my first memory
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.420]   in the United States
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.420]   and, you know,
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.260]   I had a friend
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.720]   that I went over to his house
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.280]   and this man came to the house
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.160]   and my friend,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.220]   I remember because he was my first friend
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.320]   when I came to the United States,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.360]   it was Robert Pankos.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.060]   And this man walked into the house
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.400]   and he said,
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.080]   hey, David.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.320]   He said,
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.400]   what are we having for dinner?
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.200]   So I don't know who this man is
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:39.720]   and he walks in.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.320]   I said, who's that guy?
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:40.580]   He said,
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.620]   oh, that's my dad.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.240]   That's your dad?
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.260]   You just called him David?
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.480]   He said, yeah, no.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.100]   He said, he doesn't mind?
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.160]   He said, no.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.900]   Now, I know that even in the Western culture,
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.180]   that's not natural.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.600]   That's not necessarily normal, right?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.280]   But if you say that in an Asian culture,
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.080]   I mean, forget dinner.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.840]   Yeah, you're going to be punished, right?
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.240]   Because you don't address your dad like that.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:09.780]   Hey, dad.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.220]   Or, hey, John.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.360]   Right?
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.200]   Because in an Asian culture,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.140]   it's more for the purpose of honor.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.140]   Yes, it doesn't mean
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.180]   that you don't have a love relationship.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.760]   It doesn't mean that there's no intimacy.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.660]   It just means that in that culture,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.500]   there is honor
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.180]   that is attached to the father.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.100]   So here it's saying,
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.280]   yes, he is your father,
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.900]   but recognize who he is.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.100]   And if you have one or the other,
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.840]   one will cause you to have fear
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.820]   when you don't go to him.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.080]   The other one is just too casual.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.280]   You know, like, I remember,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.380]   and I told you,
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.240]   and this is, again,
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:43.700]   outdated,
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   but, you know,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.200]   Fonzie on happy days,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.580]   and whenever he would praise,
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.980]   hey, hey, God,
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.820]   me and him are like this.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.280]   You see some rappers coming up,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.320]   and they win an award,
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.920]   and it's like, hey,
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.520]   you know,
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.220]   and their songs are filled
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.240]   with debauchery.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.700]   There are all kinds of colorful words
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.800]   that are coming out of their mouth,
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.380]   but, yeah, me and God are like this.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:07.060]   Sometimes the Western church
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.020]   doesn't recognize
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:09.020]   doesn't recognize
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.300]   who God is.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.140]   He's become,
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.560]   it's become so casual
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.680]   in the way we address him.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.660]   We just want them to say,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:17.200]   hey, you know,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:17.840]   we're lying down,
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.340]   hey, God,
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:18.840]   what's up?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.380]   I remember going to prayer chapel
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.860]   and seeing my friends
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.480]   praying like that,
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.180]   it's just kind of like,
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.400]   how do you pray like that,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:27.920]   you know?
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.600]   This is God of the universe
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.720]   that we are addressing.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.540]   He said,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.660]   hallowed be his name.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.780]   Recognize who he is.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.240]   In fact,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   if we don't recognize
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.480]   the honor
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.580]   and the weightiness
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.900]   of who it is
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.360]   that we have this relationship with,
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.100]   it will affect the way
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:46.820]   that we live.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.760]   It will affect the way
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.780]   that we worship.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.720]   It affects the way
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.160]   that we even pray.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.580]   In Leviticus chapter 10,
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.220]   verse 3,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.740]   after giving instructions
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.780]   on how to come to,
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.920]   how does a sinful man
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.600]   have a relationship
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.320]   with this God,
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.740]   gave all these orders
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.460]   to do this,
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.200]   and then the very first sacrifice
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:05.760]   that is given
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.840]   by Nadab and Nebihu,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.400]   they ignore the rules
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.520]   and they just put up
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.140]   strange fire,
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.100]   strange offering,
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.300]   and then as a result of that,
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.320]   they are consumed
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:14.920]   with fire,
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.520]   and this is what God says.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.680]   Leviticus 10, 3,
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.740]   then Moses said to Aaron,
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.100]   it is what the Lord spoke,
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.380]   saying,
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.920]   by those who came near me,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.200]   I will be treated
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.040]   as holy,
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.900]   and before all the people
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.720]   I will be honored.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.360]   So Aaron,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:27.800]   therefore,
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.940]   kept silent.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.220]   Now you look at that
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:31.400]   and say,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:31.660]   oh,
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.520]   is he egotistical?
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.660]   He said,
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.560]   I will be honored
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.600]   among my people.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.160]   Is it egotistical
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.020]   for a father
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.520]   to demand his child
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.000]   to show some respect?
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.980]   Is that egotistical?
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.840]   Of course not.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.660]   It would be weird
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.540]   if you see a child
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.160]   just slapping his dad,
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.540]   calling him
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.600]   whatever he wants him to call.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:52.780]   He's like,
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.000]   what?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.980]   What's wrong with that kid?
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.100]   He said,
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.060]   in order to have
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:58.860]   a healthy relationship
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.280]   with God,
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:48:59.880]   we need to know
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.320]   that yes,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.060]   he is our father.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.700]   He loved us.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.820]   Gave his only begotten son
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.200]   for us,
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.500]   and yet he is the God
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.440]   of gods
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.040]   and king of kings
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.720]   and lord of lords.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.980]   He's still that
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.260]   holy,
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:08.560]   holy,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.200]   holy God.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.760]   in Numbers 20,
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.300]   12,
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.160]   as they are about
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.800]   to enter into
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.660]   the promised land,
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.600]   the Israelites
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.180]   are grumbling
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.120]   and complaining again,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.580]   and Moses,
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.360]   in his anger,
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.000]   what should I do
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.340]   with them?
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.300]   And God is patient.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:21.540]   He says,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.720]   just give it to them.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.620]   Instead of following
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.400]   what God said,
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.640]   he strikes the rock,
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.360]   water comes out,
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.300]   and then as a result
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:31.760]   of that,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.380]   he gets punished
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:33.900]   and he's not,
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.900]   Moses is not allowed
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.260]   to get into
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:36.920]   the promised land.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.200]   So what happened there?
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.820]   What did he do wrong?
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.020]   Well,
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.860]   God explains
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.860]   in Numbers 20,
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.200]   12.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.400]   Lord said to Moses
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:43.860]   and Aaron,
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.620]   because you have
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.480]   not believed me
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.180]   to treat me
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:46.780]   as holy
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.640]   in the sight
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.040]   of the sons
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:48.540]   of Israel,
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.120]   therefore you
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:49.700]   shall not bring
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.320]   this assembly
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.940]   into the land
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.620]   which I have
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.100]   given them.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.200]   What was his sin?
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.360]   You did not
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:55.940]   present me
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:56.480]   as holy.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.660]   It is a mistake
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.080]   for the church
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.500]   to make God
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.380]   the beggar.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.260]   When we're present
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:10.760]   in the gospel,
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.380]   give Jesus a chance.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.940]   We're the ones
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:15.720]   who offended him.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.080]   He is a holy,
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:18.340]   holy,
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:18.960]   holy God.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.820]   And so the way
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.700]   that we do church,
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.300]   the way that we
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.300]   understand the Bible study,
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:23.940]   the way that we
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.080]   even evangelize,
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.540]   it must be
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.240]   God-centered.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.480]   we are presenting
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.200]   the king.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.740]   Yes,
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.580]   he is our father,
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.800]   but he is the king
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.360]   of kings
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.160]   and Lord of lords.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.920]   Well,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.800]   how do we reconcile
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.840]   these two things
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.280]   where we're able
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.340]   to see both?
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.580]   I think Hebrews
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.100]   chapter 4,
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.860]   16 does a
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.740]   perfect job
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.060]   of that
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.220]   because after
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.120]   explaining to us
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.220]   how the throne
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:50.560]   of grace
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.280]   has been opened,
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.760]   he invites us
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.660]   in Hebrews 4,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.120]   16,
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.460]   let us draw
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.880]   near with confidence
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.020]   to the throne
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.740]   of grace
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.240]   so that we may
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.800]   receive mercy
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.480]   and find grace
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   to help in time
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:02.680]   of need.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.820]   The whole point
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.480]   of our salvation
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.100]   is to have
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:05.760]   an open door
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.440]   to God now
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.660]   that people
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.240]   could not go
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.560]   to him,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.260]   but now he said
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:09.980]   not only is the
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.620]   door open,
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.740]   he invites us
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.340]   to come
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.820]   because the whole
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.400]   benefit
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.680]   of our salvation
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.980]   is now we have
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.200]   open access
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.940]   to our
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:21.840]   father's throne.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.660]   So if you
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.980]   celebrate,
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.880]   oh,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.320]   I'm not going
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:27.840]   to be judged,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.260]   you missed the
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:28.680]   whole point
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.140]   because that's
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.860]   just a benefit,
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.500]   but the real
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.800]   gift is God
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.300]   himself
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.200]   because he's
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:35.760]   the author of
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:35.960]   life.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:36.800]   All peace,
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.220]   joy,
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:37.840]   safety,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.540]   life,
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.300]   hope is
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.440]   in Christ.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.300]   And now
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.640]   we were alienated
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.420]   from all of that
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.080]   because we have
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:47.820]   been adopted
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.660]   children and he
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.220]   is our Abba
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:49.540]   father,
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:49.980]   he says,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.480]   come to the
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.080]   throne of grace
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.860]   with confidence
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.520]   when you have
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.100]   trouble.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.660]   But the key
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.420]   to understanding
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.240]   this text is
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.180]   that we are
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:57.700]   coming to the
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.160]   throne of grace.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.480]   The throne of
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:01.820]   grace.
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.240]   Yes,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   it is a place
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:03.920]   of grace
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.600]   and mercy,
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.340]   but it is his
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.380]   throne that we're
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:07.800]   coming to.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.100]   And if we
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.540]   ever forget
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.320]   one or the
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.720]   other,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.520]   it will hinder
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.780]   us from having
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:17.180]   an intimate
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:17.980]   relationship with
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.140]   him.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.020]   hallowed be
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:20.520]   your name.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.880]   And then he
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.120]   says,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:22.880]   your kingdom
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.320]   come.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.420]   Again,
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.000]   in the Matthew
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.300]   it says,
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:25.720]   your kingdom
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.100]   come.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:26.940]   And he
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.580]   further says,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.200]   your will be
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.780]   done on earth
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.300]   as it is in
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:29.480]   heaven.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.460]   The central
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.140]   teaching of
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:31.660]   Christ was
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.120]   about his
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.440]   kingdom.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.600]   It's about
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.420]   restoring his
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:35.760]   kingdom.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.360]   John the
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:37.880]   Baptist says,
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.500]   repent for the
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:38.960]   kingdom of
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.480]   heaven is at
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:39.720]   hand.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.500]   Jesus comes on
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:40.900]   the scene,
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.360]   says,
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.020]   repent for the
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.460]   kingdom of
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.000]   heaven is at
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:43.220]   hand.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.440]   majority of
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   the parables
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:45.860]   that Jesus
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.420]   taught was
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:46.900]   about the
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.360]   kingdom of
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:47.640]   God.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.780]   After he
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.300]   died,
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:49.840]   resurrects,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.260]   before he
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.380]   ascended to
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.020]   the father's
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:53.680]   right hand,
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.660]   he spent
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.420]   40 days,
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:55.720]   and it
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.320]   says in the
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:56.600]   book of
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.280]   Acts that
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:57.860]   he talked
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.500]   about his
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:58.900]   kingdom.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.300]   Right before
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.020]   he ascends,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.000]   the disciples
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.440]   ask,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.260]   is it now
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:03.720]   are you going
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.300]   to restore
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:04.860]   the kingdom?
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.740]   So the
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.620]   central message
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.200]   of the gospel
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.920]   is about the
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.380]   kingdom of
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:08.660]   God.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.520]   So when
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.080]   we come to
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.420]   him in
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:11.800]   prayer,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.180]   he says to
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:13.980]   pray for
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.620]   his kingdom.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.520]   And so when
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.980]   we come to
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.500]   pray for his
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:17.780]   kingdom,
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.560]   we naturally
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.920]   understand that
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.120]   we surrender
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.800]   our kingdom.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.540]   And that's
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.300]   the problem
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:25.900]   of mankind
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.780]   is because we
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.340]   are living to
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:27.940]   establish our
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.200]   kingdom.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.100]   And oftentimes
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:29.840]   even in the
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.200]   church,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.460]   we're so
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.060]   consumed with
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.720]   our kingdom,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.600]   our church,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.900]   our name,
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.460]   that when
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.260]   revival breaks
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:39.780]   out somewhere
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.220]   else,
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.060]   we're not as
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:41.740]   interested because
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.360]   our name is
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.020]   not attached.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.660]   I remember
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:45.100]   when we were
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.920]   doing homeless
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.540]   ministry and
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.180]   churches would
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.320]   hear that we're
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.020]   out there and
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:50.740]   they would ask
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:50.980]   me,
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:51.620]   can you help
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.180]   us to establish
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:52.600]   our homeless
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.040]   ministry?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.380]   And I would
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:54.520]   say,
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:54.840]   you know,
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.280]   what day do
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.540]   you want to
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:55.780]   come out?
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:55.900]   I said,
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.240]   can we come
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:56.520]   out on
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:56.840]   Tuesday?
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:57.160]   Well,
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:57.600]   Tuesday,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.340]   there's two
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:58.920]   churches out
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.380]   there and
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:53:59.740]   they're already
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.060]   feeding.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:00.960]   So it wouldn't
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.500]   make sense for
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.460]   you to set up
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.220]   your church and
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:03.660]   then compete
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.160]   with them.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:04.500]   And they said,
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:04.700]   well,
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.100]   what about
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:05.500]   Saturday?
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.080]   Well,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:06.740]   Saturday morning
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:07.200]   this other
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.040]   church comes out
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:08.440]   and they
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.260]   establish and
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:09.820]   they even have
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.220]   service.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:10.740]   How about
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.300]   Sunday morning?
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:11.500]   Well,
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:11.960]   this Sunday
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.400]   morning there's
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.000]   a big mega
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:13.340]   church that
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:13.980]   comes out and
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.460]   they have
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.000]   service and
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.240]   they have
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:15.820]   great food.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.060]   So you can
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:17.960]   probably go and
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.640]   join them in
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.120]   their work.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.480]   But almost
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.100]   always the
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.620]   response I
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:21.940]   got from
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:22.280]   them is,
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:22.440]   no,
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:22.840]   we want
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.200]   our
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:23.540]   church.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.300]   We want
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:25.620]   to do it
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.020]   in our
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:26.520]   church name.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.980]   I said,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.400]   you know,
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.180]   there's a
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:29.660]   church coming
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:29.920]   out and
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.380]   feeding almost
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:30.960]   every single
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.260]   day.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.000]   So,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.480]   you know,
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:33.940]   they're always
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.460]   struggling to
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:34.820]   find more
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.220]   people to
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.420]   help.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:35.860]   So instead
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.200]   of going
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:36.500]   out,
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:36.860]   you know,
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:37.120]   why don't
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:37.380]   you just
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:37.960]   join them,
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.560]   show up,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:38.840]   and then
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.520]   just help
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:39.920]   with the
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.360]   service.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.120]   Maybe
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:41.380]   whatever
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:41.860]   food you're
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.060]   going to
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:42.280]   bring,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:42.840]   just add
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.220]   to the
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:43.840]   table that
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.020]   they're
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:44.380]   doing.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.300]   But almost
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:46.900]   always the
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.500]   response was,
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:47.700]   no,
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.040]   we want
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.360]   our
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:48.700]   church.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.520]   We want
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:49.800]   to say
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.120]   our
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.500]   church is
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.020]   doing that.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.040]   Now,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:52.260]   I don't
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:52.460]   want to
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:52.920]   read more
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.480]   into that
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.120]   than necessary,
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.060]   but oftentimes
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.800]   even the
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:59.140]   way that
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:54:59.420]   we do
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.740]   God's
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.080]   work,
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.620]   we get
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.000]   so caught
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.380]   up in
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.180]   our
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:03.500]   kingdom.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.080]   In
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.400]   Galatians
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:05.860]   2.20
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.040]   it says,
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.500]   I have
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:06.680]   been
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.120]   crucified
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.480]   with
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:07.800]   Christ,
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.040]   and it
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:08.200]   is no
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:08.420]   longer
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:08.640]   I
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:08.780]   who
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:08.960]   live,
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.080]   but
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:09.400]   Christ
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:09.560]   who
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:09.800]   lives
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:09.940]   in
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:10.180]   me.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:10.720]   In
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:10.840]   the
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.040]   life
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.220]   which
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:11.400]   I
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:11.600]   now
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:11.800]   live
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:11.900]   in
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:12.020]   the
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.260]   flesh,
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:12.440]   I
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:12.620]   live
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:12.760]   by
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.100]   faith
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.180]   in
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:13.300]   the
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:13.400]   Son
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:13.520]   of
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:13.660]   God
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:13.780]   who
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.020]   loved
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.160]   me
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.540]   and gave
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:14.860]   himself
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.220]   up
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.500]   for
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.800]   me.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.500]   Paul
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:17.820]   wasn't
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.160]   simply
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.580]   stating
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:18.840]   a
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.360]   theological
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.080]   position.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.520]   He was
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.040]   describing
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.340]   his
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:22.800]   life.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.280]   And
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:24.480]   that's
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:24.600]   why
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:24.920]   here's
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.080]   this
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.300]   man
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:25.440]   who
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:25.680]   lost
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.180]   everything
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.500]   because
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:26.700]   of
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.080]   Christ.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.920]   Even
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.300]   as he's
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:28.480]   sitting
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:28.680]   in
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:28.920]   prison,
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.280]   he said,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:29.600]   I'm

[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:30.540]   He
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.160]   wasn't

[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.840]   Lord,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.640]   pray for

[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.320]   He's
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.100]   not praying
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.400]   for that.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:39.920]   He's
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.720]   writing a
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.020]   letter,
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.800]   concerned,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.660]   that maybe

[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.100]   He said,
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.260]   no,
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:47.660]   don't worry
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.060]   about me.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.260]   I'm

[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.780]   That's
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:16.900]   all
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.020]   we
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:17.180]   know.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.740]   There's
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:17.860]   no
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.380]   biographies
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:18.600]   written
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:18.860]   about
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:19.100]   them.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.280]   Because
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:20.480]   when
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:20.820]   Paul
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.180]   said,
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:21.400]   I
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:21.540]   have
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:21.680]   been
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.120]   crucified,
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.300]   that's
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:23.420]   what
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:23.720]   happened
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:23.920]   to
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.140]   him.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.700]   Whatever
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:26.400]   he
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:26.580]   was
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.020]   pursuing,
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.480]   whatever
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.180]   reputation,
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:28.640]   whatever
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.380]   comfort and
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:29.860]   ease,
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.580]   whatever
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.140]   kingdom he
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:31.300]   was
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:31.800]   pursuing,
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.920]   was
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.380]   crucified.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.820]   And now
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:36.120]   he was
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.500]   pursuing
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:36.980]   his
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:37.280]   kingdom.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.140]   See,
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:39.820]   when we
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.480]   repent,
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.000]   we're not
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.700]   repenting of
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.360]   a deed,
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.760]   simply.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.800]   Oh,
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.180]   I used to
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:46.380]   lie,
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:46.760]   I used to
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.120]   steal.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:47.560]   I said,
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:47.760]   yes,
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.180]   that's part
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.520]   of it.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.240]   repentance
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:50.500]   is
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:50.860]   basically
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.260]   turning
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:51.640]   from
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.780]   abandoning
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.000]   your
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:53.280]   kingdom.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.600]   I've
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:53.700]   been
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:53.880]   living
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.120]   my
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.320]   life
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:54.460]   to
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:54.760]   establish
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.040]   my
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:55.300]   kingdom,
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.300]   and now
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:56.500]   I
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:56.840]   surrender
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.860]   to
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.160]   you
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:58.360]   as

[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:58.800]   Lord.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.540]   That's
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:57:59.740]   what
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.920]   justifies
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.300]   us.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:01.920]   He
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.280]   covers
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:02.660]   us,
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.000]   not
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:03.340]   simply
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:03.640]   a
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.080]   deed.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.560]   Colossians
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.180]   1.13,
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:06.480]   it says,
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:06.780]   for he
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.340]   rescued us
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:07.600]   from the
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.200]   domain of

[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.300]   and
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:10.820]   transferred
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.200]   us to

[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.680]   redemption,
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:15.960]   the
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.320]   forgiveness
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.760]   of
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.180]   sins.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.500]   We
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:18.680]   have

[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.760]   He
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.040]   didn't
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:22.580]   deliver
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:22.840]   us
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:22.940]   so
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:23.060]   that
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:23.200]   we
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.380]   can
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:23.860]   build
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.140]   our

[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.380]   You
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:26.500]   know,
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:26.840]   before
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.140]   when we
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.320]   were in

[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:28.380]   we
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:28.520]   had
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:28.680]   an
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.020]   enemy
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:29.200]   who
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:29.320]   was
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:29.740]   trying
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:29.920]   to
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.340]   devour
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:30.600]   us,
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:30.940]   but
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.220]   now
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:31.400]   that

[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:31.640]   have
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:31.760]   been
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.100]   delivered
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:32.380]   from

[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:32.800]   now
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.020]   you
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:33.180]   can
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:33.380]   go
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:33.580]   and
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:33.940]   live
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.280]   to
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:34.560]   establish
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:34.920]   your

[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.100]   That's
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.200]   not
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.320]   what
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:36.400]   he
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:36.740]   says.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.120]   He
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:38.500]   delivered
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:38.720]   us
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:38.860]   from
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:38.940]   the

[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.260]   into

[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.680]   That's why
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:43.780]   he
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.180]   says in

[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.120]   You
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:51.220]   know

[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:55.660]   if you
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:55.800]   would

[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.260]   If
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:58:59.360]   you
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:58:59.520]   would

[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:02.580]   all
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:02.820]   these
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:03.040]   things
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.140]   will

[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:03.720]   You
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:03.800]   know

[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:04.400]   called?
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.420]   That's
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:06.560]   the

[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.540]   When
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:09.820]   the

[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.360]   they
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.640]   always
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.020]   demand

[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.000]   because
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.260]   he's
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:16.480]   going to
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:16.860]   multiply
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.180]   30,

[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.060]   fold.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:18.460]   If
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:18.580]   you
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.040]   sacrifice
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:19.340]   and
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:19.680]   give,
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.080]   and
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:20.160]   it
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:20.300]   may
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:20.420]   be
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:20.720]   hard
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.140]   now,
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.580]   but
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.020]   maybe
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.920]   five
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.120]   years
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:23.300]   from
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:23.480]   now,
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:23.680]   maybe
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:23.960]   ten
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.120]   years
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:24.220]   from
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:24.420]   maybe
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:24.820]   when
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:24.940]   you
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:25.400]   retire,
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:25.900]   he's
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.020]   going
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.100]   to
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:26.420]   add

[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:26.860]   these
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.100]   things.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:27.440]   So
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:27.620]   they
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:27.900]   have
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.060]   in
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:28.500]   mind
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.880]   that
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.080]   I'm
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.200]   going

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:31.000]   I'm
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:31.080]   going
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.180]   to

[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:31.500]   I'm
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:31.560]   going
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:31.660]   to
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.140]   sacrifice,
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.520]   because
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:33.760]   the
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.160]   payoff
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.340]   is
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:34.440]   going
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:34.520]   to
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:34.680]   come
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:34.800]   at
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:34.960]   some
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.180]   point,
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:35.600]   because
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.560]   God
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:36.800]   can
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.020]   give
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:37.140]   me
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:37.520]   much
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:37.760]   more
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:37.900]   than
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.020]   I
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.140]   can
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:38.460]   possibly
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:38.860]   earn
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:39.180]   without

[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.160]   And
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:41.340]   so
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:41.720]   our
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.240]   desire
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:42.500]   to
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:42.840]   pursue
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.140]   our

[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:43.780]   kingdom
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.040]   has

[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.980]   It's
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.120]   just
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.300]   that
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:47.500]   how
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:47.700]   we
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:47.940]   get
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.340]   that,
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:48.900]   we
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.060]   think
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:49.320]   Jesus
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:49.520]   is
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:49.640]   a

[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.280]   That's
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:51.360]   a

[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.220]   That's
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:54.440]   not
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:54.640]   what
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:54.760]   he

[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.060]   He
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:57.340]   says

[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.740]   and sisters.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.820]   you do
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.320]   not have
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:18.700]   because you
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.040]   did not
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:19.580]   ask.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.440]   You know,
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.400]   you know
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.160]   enough theology
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.920]   to not to
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.280]   ask for
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:24.820]   a Lamborghini.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.500]   You know
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.320]   enough theology
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.880]   to not to
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.440]   ask for a
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:29.720]   mansion.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.120]   So you
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:30.440]   do not
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:30.860]   pray because
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.280]   I can't
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:31.580]   pray for
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:31.840]   these things.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.380]   This is
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.260]   what's in
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:33.900]   my heart.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.040]   So I
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.440]   can't
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:35.640]   pray.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.100]   So he
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:36.300]   says,
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:36.620]   but when
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:36.940]   you do
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.300]   pray,
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:37.880]   you do
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.320]   not receive
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:38.760]   because you
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.140]   ask with
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:39.740]   wrong motives
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.340]   so that you
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:40.780]   spend it
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.340]   on your
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:41.780]   pleasure.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.660]   In other
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:43.780]   words,
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.040]   he said,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.400]   I can't
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:45.880]   answer you
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.400]   because if
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:46.560]   I
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.120]   answered your
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:47.360]   prayer,
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.640]   it would
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.040]   destroy
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:48.420]   you.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.940]   These are
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.240]   the things
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:50.600]   that I
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.200]   was trying
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.640]   to save
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.140]   you from.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.740]   I'm not
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.160]   a better
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:54.780]   avenue
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.580]   so that
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:56.880]   you can
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.540]   have access
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:57.880]   to the
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.200]   things that
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:58.640]   I saved
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.180]   you from.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.820]   It is
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.380]   when we
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.020]   come to
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:03.560]   recognize
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.140]   the treasure
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:04.960]   of Christ
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.760]   himself.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.500]   Christ
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:07.860]   himself.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.920]   That's why
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.400]   he allows
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:09.940]   suffering in
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.400]   your life.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.800]   Because if
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.260]   suffering
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   leads to
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.380]   affection
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.100]   for Christ,
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:15.860]   that suffering
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.480]   is good.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.080]   if
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.620]   hardship,
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:18.960]   if
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.420]   financial
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.200]   difficulty
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.000]   leads you
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.880]   to treasure,
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.740]   to be able
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.200]   to see the
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:24.780]   treasure in
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.240]   Christ,
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.100]   then what
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:26.700]   he did
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.340]   was good
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:27.920]   because the
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.680]   ultimate gift
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.580]   is Christ
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.140]   himself.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.540]   So when we
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.280]   ask for his
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:33.600]   kingdom,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.460]   we're not
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.060]   simply like,
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:36.260]   oh,
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:36.680]   I have all
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.160]   these desires
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:37.380]   and I
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.560]   got to
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:37.920]   give all,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.180]   I got to
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:38.740]   make all
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.740]   these sacrifices
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.480]   in order to
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:41.860]   make him
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.240]   Lord.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:43.940]   and so
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.620]   when we
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.820]   are holding
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.200]   on to
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.400]   our
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:46.680]   kingdom
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.820]   and trying
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.420]   to establish
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:48.780]   him as
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.120]   Lord,
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.400]   we say
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:50.620]   it's
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.100]   sacrifice.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:51.380]   It is
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:51.920]   tremendous
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.700]   sacrifice.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.160]   It's
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.580]   tremendous
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.120]   sacrifice.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.900]   But just
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.380]   as Jesus
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.720]   said in
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.100]   Hebrew,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.020]   because of
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:02.440]   the joy
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.280]   set before
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:03.580]   him,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.340]   he endured
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.020]   the cross.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.600]   Because of
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.080]   the joy
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.800]   set before
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.000]   him,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.260]   he endured
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:09.820]   the cross.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.500]   when we
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.160]   recognize
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.380]   the gift
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.440]   is his
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:14.800]   kingdom.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.660]   The gift
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.120]   is his
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:17.420]   kingdom.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.860]   The problem
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.120]   that we
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:19.440]   have is
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:19.620]   that we
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:19.800]   don't
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.260]   recognize
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:20.460]   the
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:20.740]   treasure
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:20.940]   we
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.240]   already
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:21.740]   have.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.680]   In
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:23.960]   Matthew
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.460]   13,
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.720]   44-46,
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.180]   the kingdom
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:26.560]   of heaven
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:26.860]   is like
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.320]   a treasure
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:27.760]   hidden in
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.160]   the field
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:28.520]   which a
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.040]   man found
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.380]   and hid
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:29.680]   again.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.820]   And from
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.400]   joy over
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:31.520]   it,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:31.900]   he goes
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.400]   and sells
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.060]   all that
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:33.560]   he has
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.100]   and buys
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.420]   that
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:34.800]   field.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.200]   Do you
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:37.520]   think that
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.240]   man was
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:38.740]   sacrificing?
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.140]   why he
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:41.560]   sacrificed
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.200]   everything
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:42.620]   for this
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:42.900]   treasure.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.360]   And he
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:44.860]   struggled
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.380]   with this
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.060]   sacrifice.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.980]   He struggled
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.580]   man,
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:48.980]   I got to
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.340]   sacrifice
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:49.960]   everything I
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.240]   have to
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.540]   have this
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:50.840]   treasure.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.800]   It's only
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.300]   a sacrifice
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:53.600]   if he
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:53.840]   doesn't
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.300]   recognize
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.480]   the
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:54.760]   treasure.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.940]   What he's
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.300]   doing,
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.000]   if other
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.720]   people found
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.100]   out what
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.660]   he had,
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.540]   they would
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:00.960]   all do
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.360]   the same
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:01.640]   thing.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.620]   He's keeping
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.060]   it quiet
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.480]   because he
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:04.760]   doesn't want
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.180]   other people
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:05.520]   to know
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.000]   the treasure
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.640]   because he
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.080]   wants to
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.380]   sell it,
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:07.780]   so he
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.060]   wants to
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:08.200]   have
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:08.600]   everything.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:09.840]   He said
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.300]   that's what
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:10.740]   kingdom of
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.060]   heaven is
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.420]   like.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.500]   So at
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:12.960]   the core
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.020]   of everything
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:14.400]   that we
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:14.780]   do and
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.200]   why we
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:15.720]   pray is
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.180]   because we
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:16.900]   understand the
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.600]   treasure of
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:17.980]   the kingdom
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.520]   of God.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.920]   Again,
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.580]   in verse
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.000]   45,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.520]   the kingdom
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:21.900]   of heaven
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.320]   is like a
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:22.560]   merchant
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.280]   seeking fine
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:23.640]   pearls.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.460]   And upon
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.160]   finding the
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:25.600]   pearl of
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.180]   great value,
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:26.580]   he went
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:26.960]   and sold
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.540]   all that
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.040]   he had
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.920]   and bought.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.760]   And he
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.220]   bought it.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.640]   And that's
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:32.840]   what it
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.180]   says in
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:33.580]   Corinthians,
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:33.940]   the God
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.200]   of this
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:34.560]   age has
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.240]   blinded the
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.840]   eyes of
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.320]   the unbeliever
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:37.600]   so that he
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:37.980]   did not see
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.960]   the glory
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.480]   of the
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:39.900]   gospel of
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.360]   Jesus Christ
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:40.880]   because he
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.220]   did not
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.060]   see the
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:42.620]   beauty of
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.100]   the gospel.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.040]   He remains
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.840]   hidden and
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.180]   blind.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.400]   So a
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:48.820]   Christian is
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.440]   somebody where
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.100]   our eyes,
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.140]   the scales
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:51.520]   have been
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.260]   taken out
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.800]   and we
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.280]   see his
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:54.620]   glory.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.600]   We see
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.080]   his beauty.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.660]   We see the
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.240]   treasure of
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:58.820]   his righteousness.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.700]   We see the
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.120]   treasure of
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:01.520]   his kingdom.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.440]   And I want
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.020]   that more than
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:04.820]   anything else in
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.240]   this world.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.020]   that's the
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:07.700]   basis of
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.240]   our prayer.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.900]   Not duty.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.000]   Not a list
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.540]   of things that
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:13.880]   I need to
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.400]   get done.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.200]   But it's a
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:16.580]   gift.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.460]   It's a
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:18.780]   gift.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.140]   Abba,
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:21.660]   Father,
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.640]   hallowed be
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.140]   your name.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.180]   Your kingdom
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:26.540]   come,
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.120]   your will be
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.560]   done on
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.020]   earth as it
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.280]   is in
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:28.480]   heaven.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.220]   The kingdom
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.220]   come means
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.280]   that Jesus,
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.180]   the king,
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.160]   is established.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.040]   you know,
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:36.340]   I've been
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:36.940]   living my
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.640]   life worried
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.440]   so much
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.480]   that I'm
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:40.840]   going to be
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.540]   dethroned.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.360]   And I
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:43.840]   volunteer.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.620]   I'm so tired.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.180]   I'm so tired
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:47.760]   of competing.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.600]   I'm so tired
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.180]   of being
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:49.560]   worried.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.420]   I'm so tired
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:50.980]   that things
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.220]   aren't going
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:51.740]   to turn out
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.180]   the way it
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:52.360]   is.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:52.720]   I'm just
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.240]   so tired.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:53.620]   Lord,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.460]   let your
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.040]   kingdom come.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.240]   You take
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:56.520]   over.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.340]   The kingdom
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.120]   come means
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.220]   all your
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:00.720]   enemies are
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.260]   driven out.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.760]   When the
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.120]   king of
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:03.680]   kings and
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.020]   Lord of
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.600]   lords comes
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.080]   in and
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.580]   he takes
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:05.760]   his
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.140]   authority,
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:06.460]   he takes
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:06.960]   his throne,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.320]   that means
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:08.840]   there's no
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.320]   other kings,
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:09.780]   no other
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.100]   power,
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.460]   no other
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.120]   authority can
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:11.720]   bother you.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.120]   That's what
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:13.600]   it means by
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.060]   the king.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:14.960]   We live so
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.700]   anxiously being
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.120]   concerned about
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.860]   all our
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.240]   enemies,
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:19.660]   like what
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.220]   they're doing,
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:20.720]   how they're
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.300]   doing things,
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:21.800]   and the
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.400]   decisions that
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:22.840]   they're making.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.120]   He says,
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:23.320]   no,
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.800]   when his
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.720]   kingdom comes,
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.880]   all other
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.400]   enemies are
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.020]   driven out.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.240]   Because there's
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:30.780]   no king,
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.240]   there's no
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.160]   authority that
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.820]   can stand up
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.420]   against him.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:34.960]   So Lord,
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.740]   I'm so tired
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:36.160]   about being
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:36.760]   worried about
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.300]   our enemies.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:37.720]   Lord,
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.580]   let your
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.240]   kingdom come.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.140]   To ask for
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:41.560]   his kingdom
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.120]   come means
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:42.680]   that all
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.040]   that has
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.660]   gone wrong
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.060]   is made
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:44.440]   right.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.220]   Because that's
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:46.780]   why sin
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.400]   came in.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.320]   Because Adam
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:48.980]   and Eve
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.000]   wanted to
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.440]   usurp the
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.040]   authority of
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:52.980]   God, and
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.520]   they wanted to
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:53.940]   touch his
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:54.460]   glory, and
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:54.780]   that's what
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.100]   caused
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:55.980]   everything to
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.580]   break apart.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.780]   And sin
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.140]   and death
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.580]   began to
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.380]   reign over
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:07:59.780]   for all
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.180]   mankind.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.840]   So to
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.260]   establish
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:02.940]   his kingdom
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:03.660]   is to
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:04.320]   restore us
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:04.820]   back.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.060]   Restore us
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.660]   back to
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.060]   what God
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.320]   intended under
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.100]   his kingdom
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.480]   to bring us
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:11.980]   back into
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:12.300]   Sabbath.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.240]   So to
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.080]   ask for
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.500]   his kingdom
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.040]   to come
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.080]   is to
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.780]   restore
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:20.440]   all that
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:20.820]   has gone
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.240]   wrong.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.640]   Lord, I'm
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.200]   so tired.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.740]   I'm so
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.760]   tired of
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.000]   being anxious
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.880]   about what
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.420]   my life is
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:29.620]   going to
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.060]   turn out to
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:30.520]   be if I
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:30.920]   make the
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.500]   wrong decision.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:31.960]   I'm so
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.540]   tired that
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.560]   my job is
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:33.920]   not going to
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.400]   turn out to
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:34.800]   be a certain
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.000]   way.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.300]   I'm so
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:35.680]   tired that
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:35.920]   I'm not
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.080]   going to
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:36.500]   have enough
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.220]   money for
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:37.760]   retirement.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.800]   I'm so
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.300]   tired.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.820]   I'm so
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.460]   concerned and
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.720]   anxious over
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.280]   so many
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:43.780]   things.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.860]   Lord, let
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.340]   your kingdom
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:46.660]   come.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.520]   Let your
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:48.980]   kingdom come.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.660]   Lord, you
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.220]   take over.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.040]   You take
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.360]   over.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.200]   our
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.340]   father, my
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:56.700]   Abba
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.880]   father, hallowed
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.220]   be your
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:08:59.580]   name.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.440]   Your kingdom
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:01.840]   come.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.880]   Your will
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.200]   be done on
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:04.800]   earth as it
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.260]   is in heaven.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.000]   That's the
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.360]   beginning.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.420]   That's the
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:09.700]   beginning.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.380]   That's why we
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:10.640]   pray.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.640]   Not because we
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:12.940]   need to get
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.580]   something done.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.300]   Not because we
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.760]   need to conquer
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.300]   the world.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.200]   But because at
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:18.800]   the center,
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.860]   at the center
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.260]   of the will
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.040]   of God and
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:23.280]   in his
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.420]   presence is
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:24.880]   life.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.020]   True life.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:28.740]   Not through
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:29.780]   him, but
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.020]   him.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.980]   So that's
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:32.380]   what prayer
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:32.700]   is.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.860]   Come to the
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.440]   throne of
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.320]   grace with
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:36.740]   confidence.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:38.900]   let's pray.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:38.900]   Let's pray.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:45.540]   Gracious and
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:45.780]   loving
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.260]   father,
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.460]   help us
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:48.840]   Lord God
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.380]   to not to
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.080]   leave this
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.880]   worship with
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.140]   more knowledge.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.320]   But I
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:54.880]   pray that this
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.460]   knowledge would
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.020]   lead to
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.300]   greater intimacy
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:58.940]   and communion
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.540]   with you.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.040]   Knowing
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.640]   father God
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.180]   that you
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.660]   desire to
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.360]   have us,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.220]   to commune
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:06.780]   with us,
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.540]   to express
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.120]   our love
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:09.720]   for you,
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.380]   to know
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.240]   that we
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:12.720]   are the
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.180]   safest,
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.180]   the most
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:14.700]   protected,
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.000]   the most
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.500]   hopeful
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.400]   when you
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:19.840]   are our
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.320]   king and
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:20.640]   you are
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.060]   our lord.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.440]   Open our
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:23.940]   eyes Lord

[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:24.900]   may see the
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.440]   beauty of
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:25.800]   what we
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.440]   already have
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:26.840]   in you,
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.920]   that we
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.500]   would desire
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.220]   you more
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:30.720]   than anything
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.280]   else in this
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:31.520]   world.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.340]   in Jesus
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:33.720]   name we
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:33.980]   pray.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.440]   Amen.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.980]   Let's all
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:36.360]   stand up for
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:36.700]   the closing
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.140]   praise.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.540]   Let's all

[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.440]   was love
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.680]   walked across
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.920]   the pages
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.980]   of time
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.060]   He who made
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.640]   every living

[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.760]   left his throne
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.520]   to wake as a

[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.200]   He became
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.700]   like the least
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.760]   of us
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.120]   beholden

[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.460]   Messiah
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.080]   The Lamb
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.280]   The Roaming Lion
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.240]   Though we still
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.600]   beholden
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:58.900]   He who died
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.020]   with sinners
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.320]   and saints
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.440]   Healed the blind
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.320]   the lost
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.720]   and the lame

[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.640]   He is in our
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.420]   ways
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:13.100]   Behold
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.860]   Him
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.200]   He who chose
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.320]   a criminal
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.480]   then
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.620]   Paid with blood
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.760]   to settle
