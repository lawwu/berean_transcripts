[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:31.940]   Thank you.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:03:01.920]   Thank you.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:31.900]   Thank you.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:04:01.880]   Thank you.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.180]   We are able to celebrate that our Lord has risen, that he has conquered death, and that
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.500]   he is alive, reigning today and forevermore.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.660]   So as we begin our service this morning, let us sing Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery as
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.420]   we rejoice in this great gospel by which we have been saved.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:39.200]   Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery, in the dawning of the King.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.820]   He, the theme of heaven's praises, roped in frail humanity.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:59.560]   In our longing in our darkness, now the light of life has come.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:09.740]   Look to Christ, look to Christ who condescending, take our flesh to rest of us.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:26.860]   Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery, He, the perfect Son of Man.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:37.040]   In his living, in his living, never trace no state of sin.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:47.060]   See the true and better weather, come to save the health of man.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:56.840]   Christ the great and true fulfill, and of all with him we stand.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:12.160]   Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery, Christ the Lord upon the tree.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:24.340]   In the stead of ruined sinners, he's a land of victory.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:34.780]   See the Christ of our redemption, see the path that's been on foe.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:50.460]   Behold the Wondrous Mystery, slain by death, that God of mine.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:59.780]   Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery, slain by death, that God of mine.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.020]   God of life
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.540]   But no great
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.160]   God is
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.540]   Stringing
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.600]   Praise the Lord
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.900]   Praise the Lord
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.360]   What a foretaste
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.480]   A deliverance
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.560]   High on me
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.100]   Who may your home
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.680]   Christ in power
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.480]   Resurrected
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.160]   As we will be
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.880]   When he has been
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   As we won
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.340]   The wondrous mystery
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.380]   Slain my death
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.200]   The God of life
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   But no great
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.060]   Could ever
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.720]   Strain him
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   Praise the Lord
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.060]   He is alive
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:08:01.160]   Good morning
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.520]   Welcome to Brewing Community Church
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.120]   As you guys know
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.740]   We had a very busy week this week
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.060]   Starting from Palm Sunday
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.560]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.180]   We had our Passover meal
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.880]   This Friday
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.400]   We had our Good Friday communion service
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.740]   We had our early rise service this morning
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.300]   And now we are going to be celebrating the resurrection of Christ
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.020]   Again it reminds me of Acts chapter 2
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.720]   It says that the church was filled with awe
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.460]   And they were gathering together daily
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.000]   To celebrate
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.100]   To fellowship
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.140]   To break bread
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.200]   To pray together
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.040]   And so we kind of
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.620]   The culture that we have created in the western church
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.720]   Where this is something that we do on Sunday
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.120]   And then we kind of come
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.900]   And then if it's inconvenient we don't come
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.160]   But in the early church
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.900]   Part of the reason why the church exploded
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.820]   Is because people were so consumed
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.880]   With the things of God
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.520]   And they couldn't have enough
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.040]   And so even though we do this once a year
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.920]   To me it's a week that I look forward to
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.460]   Every year
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.880]   At the end of it
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.460]   There's a lot of people tired
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.680]   There's people who have been working all day yesterday
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.300]   Just cooking and prepping
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.820]   And so there will be lunch after service
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.180]   But at the end of it
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.700]   Ultimately it's not simply
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.240]   Because it's a special week
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.400]   You know of us gathering together
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.500]   For the purpose of the church
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.020]   But at the end of the day
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.980]   It's to remind us and refresh us
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.480]   That what we celebrated this week
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.920]   Is at the center of our lives
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.560]   It's not just something that's important
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.720]   But it is everything
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.440]   And so what we celebrate this morning
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.820]   The resurrection of Christ
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.900]   Hopefully
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.920]   Again if you've been walking with us
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.700]   Through the whole week
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.180]   That it will have a deeper impact on you
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.920]   Than possibly it would have if you didn't
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.460]   So a few things that I want to
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.660]   Mention before we start
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.500]   Our Berean service auction
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.380]   For mission funding
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.060]   Today is the last day to sign up

[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:52.340]   We pray this morning as we meditate upon the resurrection of Christ
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.500]   And what it means for us
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.400]   I pray that that hope will become so clear
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.880]   That our hearts, our mind, our lives
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.480]   May be directed and empowered by it
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.300]   May your name be magnified
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.540]   Just as a text that we read, it says
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.980]   If Christ has not been raised, our faith is futile
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.600]   Everything that you and I are doing every single week
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   Every Bible study
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.440]   Hinges upon the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.940]   If you are a guest here
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.980]   Or maybe even if you've been a Christian
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.080]   And you haven't really meditated on it for a while
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.600]   And the resurrection doesn't seem real
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.860]   Because you've never seen it
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.640]   You've heard it
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.020]   And you believe it
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.040]   But you've never personally seen it
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.420]   And so as a result of that
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.480]   Maybe your faith is weak
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.220]   You know, you just kind of assume it
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.060]   But it doesn't make the impact that it should
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.680]   Or maybe you're here as a guest
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.320]   And you've never encountered this Christ
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   The resurrected Christ
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.420]   And you have a hard time believing it
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.600]   And if that's you
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.800]   You're not alone
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.540]   Because the New Testament account
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.040]   Tells us that even the disciples
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.400]   Had a hard time believing this
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.240]   When Jesus told them that he was going to die
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.920]   And be resurrected
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.980]   And then he was actually crucified
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.700]   They never even went to check
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.860]   Because they couldn't believe it
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.020]   Now you have to remember
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.080]   These are people who are eyewitnesses
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.360]   Of Jesus walking on water
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.780]   He healed the sick
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.700]   He raised Lazarus from the dead
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.340]   And yet
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.940]   When Christ died
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.380]   They thought it was over
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.480]   You ever hear the term
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320]   You know
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.560]   You're beating a dead horse
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.280]   Beating a dead horse
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:27.980]   Basically means
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.840]   His hope is gone
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.280]   There's no point in waiting
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.460]   There's no point in seeking
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.520]   It's over
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.940]   And so when Christ was crucified
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.160]   It was done for them
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.640]   And they were completely lost
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.140]   Even when Jesus shows up
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.980]   They couldn't believe their eyes
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.580]   Could that really be
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.720]   How can this be you?
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.400]   So Thomas asked
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.360]   Let me see your scar
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.720]   Let me see if this is really you
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.040]   So he had to touch his scars
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.300]   And Jesus had to show him
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.020]   That it was him
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.040]   And then they finally realized
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.100]   Oh my gosh
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.000]   He was resurrected
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.840]   And only in retrospect
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.720]   They look back and say
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.340]   He's been telling us this
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.300]   And it actually happened
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.380]   Well Jesus himself said
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.180]   When people asked him
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.140]   You're claiming some crazy things
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.000]   Prove yourself
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.880]   What are the signs?
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240]   And Jesus says
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.640]   I will leave you a sign of Jonah
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.040]   His death and resurrection
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.860]   I want to give you two quotes
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.280]   From two non-Christians
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.760]   Because I don't want to quote Christians
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.860]   In case you say
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.600]   Of course Christians are going to say that
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.120]   The first one is from
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.000]   Paula Fredrickins
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.660]   Who is a Jewish scholar
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.040]   A well-known Jewish scholar
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.360]   And this is what she says
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.980]   I know in their own terms
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.800]   Talking about the early church
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.620]   What they saw was the raised Jesus
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.520]   That's what they say
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.460]   And then all the historical evidence
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.320]   We have afterward
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   Attest to their conviction
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.380]   That that's what they saw
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.400]   Now obviously Paula was not there
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.000]   But she's looking at all the evidence
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   Of the people that they study
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.540]   In the early church
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.620]   That whether you believe it or not
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.480]   It is clear that they believed it
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.520]   Gerd Ludman
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.780]   Who's actually a known atheist
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.020]   He doesn't even have faith
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.800]   But he's a New Testament scholar
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.080]   And after studying
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.560]   The historical evidence
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.960]   Of Jesus' resurrection
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.440]   This is what he says
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:18.760]   It says
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.320]   It may be taken as a historical
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.960]   Certain that Peter
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.640]   And the disciples
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.460]   Had experiences
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.000]   After Jesus' death
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.380]   In which Jesus appeared to them
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.420]   As the risen Christ
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.320]   There is no serious
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.340]   New Testament scholar
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.480]   Who refutes
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.740]   That something happened
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.820]   Because when you look at it
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.760]   So many people
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.860]   Gave their lives
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.260]   A radical change
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.480]   Of Jews and Gentiles
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.260]   Who despised each other
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.860]   All of a sudden
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.820]   Started calling each other
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.340]   Brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.380]   That would be
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.540]   A crazier story
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.180]   Than if you fell asleep
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.280]   For a few days
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.240]   And woke up and said
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.280]   That the Republicans
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.940]   And the Democrats
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.960]   Became one party
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.440]   Right?
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.480]   They reconciled
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.220]   And now they're going to be
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.740]   One party
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.460]   They're going to be united
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.480]   That's much easier
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.920]   To grasp
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.520]   Than the Jews and Gentiles
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.300]   Because Jews and Gentiles
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.960]   Hated each other
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.240]   For thousands of years
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.960]   It wasn't just political
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.840]   It was spiritual
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.300]   But that's what happened
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.740]   You had runaway slaves
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.140]   And slave owners
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.160]   Sit together
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.740]   And call each other
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.700]   Brothers in Christ
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.000]   You had people
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.540]   Who had PhD in religion
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.640]   Sitting and listening
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.760]   To teachings
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.880]   From a tax collector
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   From someone
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.040]   Who's never been educated
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.800]   What happened?
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.020]   You notice here
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.080]   The text that we're looking at
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.820]   In 1 Corinthians 15
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.600]   13 to 19
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.700]   He's not trying to argue
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.960]   The resurrection of Jesus
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.140]   He's arguing
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.160]   The resurrection of people
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.040]   Of the followers of Jesus
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.540]   Because the resurrection of Jesus
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.960]   Didn't need proof
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.900]   Because the people
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.880]   Who saw the resurrected Christ
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.140]   Existed when this letter
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:56.860]   Was being written
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.020]   500 separate people
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.040]   Aside from the disciples
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.920]   Saw
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.900]   Physically
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.600]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.660]   So you notice here
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.080]   He says
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.400]   Of course people are raised
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.500]   If people are not raised
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.760]   And even Jesus wasn't raised
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.920]   Now I don't need to
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.700]   Convince you of that
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.780]   Because there's over
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.620]   500 people
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.860]   Who are eyewitnesses
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.360]   In fact in the early church
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.420]   So many of them
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.420]   Gave their lives
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.040]   Testing
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.620]   Attesting to this truth
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.840]   That many people
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   Ended up becoming Christians
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.020]   Simply by their testimony
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.500]   How can this many people
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.720]   Go to the grave
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.860]   If this is all a lie
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.720]   If this was just propaganda
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.160]   For their own benefit
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.540]   Clearly they're not benefiting
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.200]   You have people
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.040]   Who are giving their lives
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.800]   Become poverty
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.980]   Who are being thrown out
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.700]   Of synagogues
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.400]   In their homes
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.880]   They're losing their businesses
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.200]   In the hundreds
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.020]   And in the thousands
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.040]   How can they
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.380]   If it is for their own benefit
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.100]   Be doing that
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:50.800]   So that's why
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.860]   Even the secular scholars
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.200]   When they study
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.360]   The proof of the resurrection
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:55.780]   It says
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.060]   Well
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.680]   Whether it happened or not
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.260]   We're not sure
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.320]   But one thing we do know
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.500]   Is they believed it
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.740]   Hundreds of people
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.020]   Who are eyewitnesses
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.160]   For sure they believed it
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.000]   So the people
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.500]   Who are trying to refute this
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.900]   Comes up with theories
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.220]   And say
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:10.460]   Well
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.160]   They clearly saw something
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.440]   Something miraculous
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   Must have happened
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   At least in their sight
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.360]   So maybe it was
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.560]   The twin brother of Jesus
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.060]   As ridiculous as that sounds
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.900]   That's one of the theories
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.640]   That they've been given
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.820]   Another theory
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.680]   They call it swoon theory
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.920]   Where Jesus just kind of fainted
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.540]   He fainted
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.140]   Right
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.640]   He survived the cross
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.400]   And he fainted
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.740]   And then he just got back up
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.780]   And then he started going around
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.080]   And talking about who he is
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.180]   They're all the ridiculous theories
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.820]   That came out
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:40.980]   Because they don't understand
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.780]   How can somebody come back
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.380]   From the dead
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.560]   But that's exactly
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.760]   What we are here to celebrate
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.520]   And that's exactly
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.080]   What happened 2,000 years ago
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.500]   And that is the reason
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.980]   Why the impact
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.680]   Of the resurrection
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.060]   Has impacted
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.680]   All of mankind
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.480]   Since then
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.820]   And even that
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.580]   Is not refuted
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.480]   Whether you
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   Love Christ
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.280]   Or hate Christ
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.800]   There is no argument
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.540]   That this single event
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.500]   Has shifted
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.760]   The course
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.960]   Of human history
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.700]   What did the resurrection prove?
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.080]   Well
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.980]   Number one
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.520]   It tells us
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.340]   Without a shadow of a doubt
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.580]   That what Jesus said
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.600]   About himself is true
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.880]   Romans 1-4
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.160]   It says
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   Concerning his son
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.820]   Who was born of a descendant
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.160]   Of David
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.040]   According to the flesh
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.900]   Who was declared
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.660]   The son of God
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.340]   With power
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.560]   By the resurrection
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.620]   From the dead
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.800]   He made it very clear
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.300]   Who he was
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:34.660]   In fact
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.720]   When he asked the disciples
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.540]   Who do you say
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.180]   That I am
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.020]   You are the Christ
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.600]   The son
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.800]   Of the living God
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.020]   He wanted to make sure
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.760]   That they understood
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.400]   Who he was
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.820]   And then he confirmed it
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.900]   Through his death
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.660]   And resurrection
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.100]   That he is the son
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.520]   Of the living God
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.540]   Now why is that
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.120]   So important?
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.840]   Outside of the fact
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.180]   That it's like
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.760]   God walked among us
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.180]   The God of the universe
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:36:59.880]   Emptied himself
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.860]   And walked among us
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.720]   Great
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.140]   We can celebrate
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.120]   We can sing about that
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.360]   But what is the impact
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.940]   Of that
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.140]   To you and I?
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.620]   The reason why
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.280]   The declaration
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.900]   Of his deity
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.200]   That he is the son of God
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.580]   He is who he says he was
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.680]   Is
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.780]   Is so important
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.120]   It's because
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.340]   Jesus claimed
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.340]   That he had the power
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.000]   Of life
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.140]   And death
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.760]   He had the power
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.460]   Of life
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.500]   And death
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.840]   Imagine today
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.380]   If somebody
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.820]   Came up with a new invention
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.600]   And if you swallow
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.260]   This pill
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.360]   Right
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   That you're going to be able
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.340]   To extend your life
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.680]   For another 50 years
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Right
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.140]   That man
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.960]   My guess
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.540]   Is probably going to be
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.620]   The richest man
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.180]   On earth
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.620]   People will pay
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.400]   Whatever they have
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:48.880]   They'll empty
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.800]   Their bank accounts
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.240]   They'll sell their homes
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.640]   Especially if they're
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.140]   At the tarot
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:53.960]   Of their life
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.340]   To just extend it
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.580]   For another 50 years
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.280]   Because
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.880]   Ever since we are born
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.520]   Ever since we were born
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.420]   Into this world
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.180]   Our core
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.220]   Our core value
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.460]   Our core motivation
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.520]   Is to live
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.660]   Even an infant
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.300]   That is born
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.040]   From the moment
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.740]   That it is born
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.880]   Is looking for milk
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.060]   Who taught him that
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.800]   They come
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.960]   And he's gasping
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.480]   For air
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.680]   And trying to survive
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.460]   Who taught him that
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.340]   It wasn't years
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:25.960]   Of training
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.600]   He's innately born
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.880]   To live
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.300]   Everything that we do
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.580]   From that moment on
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.880]   Is so that we can have
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.840]   A better life
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.560]   We go to school
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.420]   We work hard
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.160]   You get degrees
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.200]   You make investments
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.400]   You put money away
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.720]   You buy houses
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.840]   Everything that we do
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.680]   So that we can have
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.660]   A better life
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.940]   But Jesus says
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.580]   In John 10
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.280]   17 to 18
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.940]   For this reason
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.760]   The father loves me
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.420]   Because I lay down my life
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.100]   So that I may take it again
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.420]   No one
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.640]   No one
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.180]   Has taken it away from me
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.120]   But I lay it down
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.040]   On my own initiative
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.900]   I have authority
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.580]   To lay it down
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.280]   And I have authority
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.100]   To take it up again
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.060]   This commandment
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.220]   I receive from the father
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:05.660]   He says
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.540]   He is the author of life
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.160]   Now anybody can put it down
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.860]   But he says
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.540]   He has power to raise it up
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.420]   And then in John 5 21
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.440]   For just as the father
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.200]   Raises the dead
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:18.940]   And gives him life
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.900]   Even so the son
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.020]   Also gives life
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.480]   To whom he wishes
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.340]   Not only can he
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.620]   Lay his life down
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.940]   And raise it back up
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.840]   But he says
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.960]   He has the power
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.780]   To give that life
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.400]   To anybody
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.580]   His resurrection
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.640]   His declaration
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.820]   of him being
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.600]   The son of God
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.200]   Meant
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.800]   That what he said
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.760]   Was true
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.600]   Now
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   Why do we even
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.040]   Need life
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.680]   Aren't we living
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.860]   Well Romans 5 12
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.120]   It says
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.760]   Therefore just as
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.400]   Through the one man
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.360]   Sin entered into the world
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.000]   The death
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.220]   Came through sin
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.020]   And so death
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.860]   Spread to all men
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.760]   Because all
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   Sinned
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.140]   All have sinned
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.680]   And fall short
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.560]   Of the glory of God
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.060]   Now
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.200]   We may be physically
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:01.940]   Living
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.040]   Whether you are
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.500]   Young
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.100]   Whether you are
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:05.500]   Old
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.040]   We have
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.220]   Biological life
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.180]   But when the Bible
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.340]   Talks about death
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340]   It's not just
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:11.820]   The physical
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.940]   It's also the spiritual
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.980]   Romans 5 17
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.340]   Says
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.640]   For if by the
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.580]   Transgression of one
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.660]   Death reigned
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.680]   Through the one
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.860]   We didn't just
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.600]   Experience death
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.380]   The Bible says
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:21.820]   That death
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.560]   Reigns
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.660]   So what does it
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.300]   Mean to reign
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.340]   Typically we think
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.840]   Of a king
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.340]   We live in a
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.400]   Democratic republic
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.320]   So we don't
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.160]   We hear stories
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.440]   Or we watch movies
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.060]   About a king
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.700]   But we can get
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.380]   The gist of what
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:38.820]   That means
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.940]   For a king to reign
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.540]   Is that every part
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.660]   Of his kingdom
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.560]   He's the final say
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.200]   He affects
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.500]   Everything that happens
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:48.860]   In that king
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.400]   That's what it means
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.600]   For the king to reign
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.220]   But the scripture says
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.600]   Death reigns
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.560]   Over all mankind
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.660]   In other words
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.460]   Everything that you
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.300]   And I experience
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.400]   On this earth
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.440]   This physical earth
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.480]   He said
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.080]   It has something
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.040]   To do with death
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.800]   It has an effect
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.140]   On everything that we do
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.980]   It affects our marriage
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.100]   It affects our family
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.220]   It affects our work
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.340]   It affects our leisure
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.240]   It affects our economy
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.460]   It affects our politics
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.600]   The central thing
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.900]   That affects everything
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.700]   That we do
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.400]   Is not who's in the
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.000]   White house
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.660]   It's not the economic trend
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.300]   It's not what's going
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.420]   To happen with a tariff
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.500]   All of these things
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.760]   Are minor
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.800]   In comparison
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.700]   To what the scripture
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:30.980]   Said
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.040]   It is sin
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.980]   And death
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.440]   That reigns
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.920]   All these other things
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.820]   Are ramifications
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.500]   Of that
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.840]   Jesus Christ
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.380]   Says
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.180]   He came
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.060]   To deal
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.920]   With that sin
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.600]   I think the
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.580]   Struggle is
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.320]   Often times
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   In our day to day life
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:50.940]   We don't feel
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   We don't feel
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.540]   The effect
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.040]   Of sin
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.120]   Let me
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.180]   Illustrate this point
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:56.480]   To you
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.060]   We have five senses
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.600]   Right
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.140]   We have
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.800]   Hearing
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.820]   Smelling
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.780]   Tasting
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.460]   Touching
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.200]   And seeing
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.780]   Out of the five senses
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.120]   If I was to ask you
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.880]   To choose one sense
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.700]   That if you were
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.420]   To get rid of it
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.740]   I can live without it
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.240]   Which one would you choose?
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.900]   Anybody would choose sight?
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.540]   Yeah
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.460]   That's typical
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.120]   Right
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.180]   Of the five
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.040]   Which one would you choose?
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.780]   Well
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.040]   According to
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.300]   Staticians
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.960]   Who went and
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.040]   Actually asked people
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.220]   Seventy-eight percent
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.900]   Of the people asked
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.480]   Said that they chose
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.220]   Smell
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.520]   Right
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.020]   So I'm assuming
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.940]   That kind of
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.240]   Representative of this group
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.060]   About 70
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.080]   Almost 80 percent
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:46.400]   Smell
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.280]   And the reason why
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.880]   We choose smell
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.280]   Is because
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.380]   If you lose smell
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.460]   No one can tell
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.860]   But you
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.940]   You look the same
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.680]   You sound the same
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.080]   Maybe you
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.620]   I don't know
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.580]   If it's going to
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.260]   Change your vocal
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.160]   Right
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.520]   Sounds
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:57.960]   But it says
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.620]   No one's going to tell
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.240]   Except you
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.600]   But smell
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.980]   Is directly related
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.960]   To appetite
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.480]   So I said
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.260]   Well what's the big deal
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:07.540]   I can
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.740]   I can live bland
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.200]   I don't like
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.220]   Spicy things anyway
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:10.760]   Right
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.000]   It said that smell
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.760]   Is also
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.240]   Somehow related to
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.080]   Understanding danger
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.340]   I don't know
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.060]   How that works
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.040]   Those of you guys
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.420]   Who are
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.320]   Doctors and biologists
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.920]   And researchers
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.320]   You can
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.420]   You can refute that
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.160]   But that's what it said
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.000]   The researchers say
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.800]   Another thing that it does
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.040]   Is
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.000]   Because you lose
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.840]   The sense of smell
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.120]   You lose
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   The sense of hygiene
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.820]   Because you can't
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.720]   Smell yourself
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.120]   Now
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.720]   All of these things
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.360]   Seem minor
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   But is it
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.040]   If you can't
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.740]   Smell yourself
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.200]   You're walking
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.900]   Out of the house
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.240]   And you smell
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.540]   You stink
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.800]   What ramification
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.420]   Does it have
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.360]   Right
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.300]   You're going to
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.040]   Lose some friends
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.180]   You're going to
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.080]   Sit in the church
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.580]   With nobody
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.180]   Around you
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.680]   Right
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.740]   It has
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.980]   Social effects
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.380]   In fact
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:08.800]   It says
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.740]   The sense of smell
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.100]   Is directly related
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.300]   To how people
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.040]   We relate to
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:13.520]   One another
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.920]   A sense of connection
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.580]   Affection
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.560]   Is related to
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.360]   The sense of smell
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.660]   So they say
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.220]   That
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:19.760]   Whatever
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.340]   Whether by an accident
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.860]   Or whether
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.980]   By genetic defect
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.460]   Or whatever
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.180]   It may be
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.080]   They said
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.340]   That 60%
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.400]   Of people
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.840]   Who lose
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.460]   Their smell
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.320]   Have a very
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:30.920]   Difficult time
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.960]   Connecting with people
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.720]   And it ultimately
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.820]   Leads to depression
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.700]   And isolation
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.580]   Now
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.400]   On the surface
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   We would have
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.540]   Never known that
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.180]   It's only through
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:40.680]   The studies
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.400]   That people found
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.000]   How important
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.700]   Smell is
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.800]   To community
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.020]   And relating
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:45.740]   To one another
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.280]   I say all of this
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.520]   Because often times
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.680]   We don't see
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.620]   The direct effect
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.160]   Of sin
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   When we are filled
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.080]   With pride
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.840]   And anger
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.620]   And bitterness
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.700]   How it affects
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.740]   The community
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.240]   How it affects
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:44:59.820]   The people around
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.420]   How it affects
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.020]   The relationship
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:01.880]   That we have
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.720]   We don't think
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.420]   That's what it is
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.440]   We typically think
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.380]   It must be you
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.780]   Because
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.660]   We have a hard time
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.720]   Smelling our own sins
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.320]   But we smell
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.220]   Other people's sins
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.320]   Very clearly
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.380]   We become experts
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.480]   At what other people
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:14.840]   Are doing
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.660]   That's wrong
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.000]   See when we live
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.780]   Under the reign
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.200]   Of sin
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:19.700]   It affects
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.560]   Our marriages
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.720]   It affects
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.180]   Our relationship
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:23.860]   With our children
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.260]   The very things
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:25.960]   That God has given
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.300]   To us
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.020]   As a gift
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.660]   You know
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.680]   I've officiated
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.280]   Over a hundred weddings
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:31.920]   I don't know exactly
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.860]   What the number is now
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.620]   But I've never
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.780]   Officiated a single wedding
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.600]   Where there was
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.320]   A single person
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.240]   That came to the altar
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.340]   Kicking and screaming
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.300]   That despite the fact
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:41.940]   That I don't want
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.340]   I don't want
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.100]   To get married
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.820]   For the glory
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.320]   Of God
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.980]   Right
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.020]   No
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.080]   They're the ones
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:49.720]   Kicking and screaming
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.660]   To get to the altar
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:51.620]   They're the ones
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.560]   Fighting with their parents
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.680]   Fighting with everybody else
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.420]   I'm going to get there
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.180]   No matter what
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.320]   I've never officiated
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.640]   A wedding
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.140]   Where either of the party
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.420]   Came kicking and screaming
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.480]   Because it was a gift
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.060]   Because it produces joy
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:05.960]   And yet
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.200]   Years later
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.560]   Some of the greatest
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.220]   Heartaches
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.280]   In life
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.120]   Comes from
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.980]   This marriage
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   Some of the greatest
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.860]   Pain that you experience
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.920]   Living in this earth
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.360]   Is from that
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.060]   Union
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.900]   You have kids
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.280]   Soon as a kid
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.120]   Comes into the world
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:25.940]   There's celebration
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.720]   We celebrate their
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.340]   Hundred days
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.100]   You know
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:28.840]   One year
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.860]   And the whole
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.220]   Community celebrates
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.240]   But some of the
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   Greatest pain
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:34.820]   In life
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:35.420]   Comes from
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.180]   Raising children
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.240]   The rebellion
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.340]   Raising another
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.320]   Sinner in their home
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:41.800]   And then adding
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.400]   Another sinner
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.000]   In their home
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.140]   And some of the
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.040]   Greatest heartaches
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:45.800]   As parents
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.580]   Come from
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.740]   Your own children
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.680]   As much as we
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.600]   Desire community
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.660]   The scripture says
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.660]   When sin reigns
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.820]   It affects everything
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.760]   Every good thing
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.000]   That God has given us
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.080]   It gets perverted
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.020]   Because of sin
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.260]   Because all mankind
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.500]   Live under the curse
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.120]   Of this sin
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.520]   Sin reigns
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.380]   That's what this
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.780]   Week represents
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.660]   That Christ
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.080]   Left his throne
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.780]   Humbled himself
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.560]   Walked as a
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.480]   Humble servant
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.380]   And then he
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:18.980]   Took upon
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:19.620]   That curse
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.140]   Of man
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:20.900]   On himself
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.700]   On the cross
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.620]   And in his
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.080]   Resurrection
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.040]   He reverses
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:25.720]   This curse
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.260]   And then promises
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:28.760]   Us
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.620]   That we will
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.400]   Do the same
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.540]   The Bible tells us
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.320]   That his resurrection
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.620]   Was just the first fruit
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.020]   He didn't just
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:38.680]   Resurrect so that
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.300]   We can celebrate
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:39.920]   His resurrection
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.280]   He said
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.140]   He resurrected
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.020]   So that he can
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:42.980]   Open the path
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.480]   And the door
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.420]   So that we would
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.100]   Also follow
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:45.820]   In those steps
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.720]   And that's exactly
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.260]   What we want to
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:47.980]   Get at this morning
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.680]   In 1 Corinthians
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.240]   15 42-44
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.940]   He describes
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.760]   What that resurrection
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.580]   One day is going
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.720]   To be like for us
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.180]   He says
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.080]   So also the resurrection
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.700]   Of the dead
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.400]   It is sown
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.600]   A perishable body
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.100]   It is raised
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.140]   An imperishable body
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:01.960]   It is sown
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.540]   In dishonor
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:02.940]   It is raised
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.400]   In glory
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.800]   It is sown
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.280]   In weakness
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:04.820]   It is raised
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.300]   In power
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.160]   It is sown
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   A natural body
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.440]   It is raised
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.280]   In spiritual body
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.080]   If there is
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.800]   A natural body
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.600]   There is also
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.860]   A spiritual body
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   It is not by accident
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:15.640]   That Paul used
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.500]   The term sown
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.160]   Because sowing
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.360]   Typically refers to
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:18.560]   What?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.580]   Planting
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.540]   Right?
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.780]   You plant
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.260]   But why
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.120]   What is the purpose
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:23.680]   Of planting?
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.640]   To get rid of the seed
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.360]   So we don't have
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.100]   To see it anymore
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:30.900]   Bury it
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.620]   Because typically
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.440]   When we think of
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.680]   If somebody passes away
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.260]   Or dies
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.460]   We bury them
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.500]   And we don't bury them
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.960]   Thinking that something
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.020]   Good is going to come out of it
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.780]   We bury them
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.240]   So that
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.600]   The rotting of their flesh
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.720]   That we don't have to see
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.800]   But it is deliberate
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.720]   That he uses the term
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:47.980]   Sown
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.320]   Because when you sow something
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.100]   You sow it in the ground
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.780]   In order for something good
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.840]   It's a fruit to come from
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.500]   A plant
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.000]   A tree
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.300]   There's something to come from that
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.040]   So now
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.200]   He's basically sown
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.520]   The word sown
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.240]   Is being used
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.480]   To describe our death
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.320]   Now because of his resurrection
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.540]   We will be sown
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.000]   He says
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.260]   Perishable
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.500]   But we'll be raised
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.520]   Imperishable
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.740]   Right?
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.640]   If you go to the supermarket
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.760]   And it says perishable
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.680]   It basically means
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.320]   You have to hurry up
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:15.680]   And eat it
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.580]   Because it's going to rot
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.560]   If you don't
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.680]   Imperishable means
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   You can just leave it outside
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.160]   It's not going to disappear
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.660]   So when he says
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.340]   Perishable
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.200]   Imperishable
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.960]   Another way to say that
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.320]   Is temporary
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.260]   And eternal
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.280]   Temporary and eternal
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.520]   What we have now
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.340]   Is subject to decay
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.640]   It's temporary
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.080]   It's going to pass
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.840]   And the moment that you are born
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.660]   There's some level of decay
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.240]   That happens
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:41.840]   Some of us
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.980]   Are further along
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.620]   In this decay
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.840]   Right?
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.200]   And we're very aware of it
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.320]   I'm very aware of it
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.780]   Right?
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.240]   I remember
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.000]   In my mid-40s
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.760]   I went to the doctor
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.040]   And I
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.840]   Again
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.200]   You know
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.240]   Those of you who are older
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:57.920]   May relate
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.940]   We didn't grow up
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:59.440]   With internet
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.840]   TV turned off
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.700]   At 12 o'clock
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.520]   There's nothing to do
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.080]   Right?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.500]   We didn't have cell phones
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.460]   So if you don't go to sleep
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:06.920]   There's nothing
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.620]   You're going to be sitting
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:08.140]   In the dark
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:08.540]   That's
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.300]   There's not much to do
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:10.880]   Right?
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.120]   So we played
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.360]   A lot of sports
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.640]   Baseball
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.200]   Football
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.240]   Even hockey
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.100]   You know
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:18.620]   Well basketball
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.820]   Was my favorite sport
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.300]   Eventually
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.760]   But I remember
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.480]   Going to the doctor
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:22.900]   And the doctor
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.720]   Looked at my knee
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.880]   And then he said
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.440]   You know
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.600]   You injured your right knee
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.320]   But you never took
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:27.980]   Good care of it
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.680]   Because I kept on
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.380]   Playing on it
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:29.900]   And now
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.800]   All the
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.260]   All the cartilages
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.060]   Are loose
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:33.600]   And so we're going
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.160]   To have to shave
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:34.760]   That off
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.960]   So there's parts
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.540]   Of my knees
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.580]   That are bone to bone
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.900]   And then at the end
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.360]   Of that he says
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.020]   Is there any treatment
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.400]   It's like no
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.180]   We can just soften
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:41.700]   The pain
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.660]   But you can't fix it
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.920]   Maybe one day
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.380]   They'll come out
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:44.880]   With technology
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.820]   Where that can be fixed
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.260]   But right now
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:46.820]   We don't have it
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.380]   And so I had surgery
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.160]   To shave it off
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.460]   And then the next thing
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.220]   He told me was
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.120]   You can't play basketball anymore
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.900]   Now some of you
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.460]   Don't understand
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.940]   The devastation of that
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.100]   Because if that
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.380]   That was all we did
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.080]   With free time
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.240]   I played probably
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.560]   Three, four times a week
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.120]   At least
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.460]   That's all we did
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.520]   There's no video games
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   Or at least
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:09.940]   I didn't enjoy
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.740]   Playing video games
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.360]   I wasn't into
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.340]   Watching K-drama
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.780]   You know
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.940]   And I was a youth pastor
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.460]   And then became
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.160]   A college pastor
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:16.740]   So I was always
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.460]   With young people
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.420]   So I was constantly
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.080]   You know
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.760]   Playing basketball
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.320]   Or softball
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.220]   And then him telling me
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.980]   You can't play basketball
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.960]   Like some of you guys
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.480]   Love golf
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:26.900]   And say no
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.020]   You can't play golf anymore
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.600]   Right
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.640]   Some of you guys
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.100]   Like running
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:30.940]   I don't understand you
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.920]   But you can't run anymore
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.600]   Right
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.800]   Because that
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.640]   That was my hobby
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.660]   That's all I did
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.220]   And then say
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:37.960]   You can't play anymore
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.540]   I remember coming home
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.100]   Only
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.320]   Some of you may understand
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:42.960]   I just like
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.080]   That's over then
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.700]   That part of my life
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.020]   Is over
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.260]   So
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.300]   I'm very aware
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.480]   Our bodies decay
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.040]   Some of you guys
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.540]   Who are younger
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.480]   May not know
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.040]   But those of you
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.740]   In the Jubilee
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.040]   Right
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.320]   We don't
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:57.780]   You know
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.400]   We just need to make
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.060]   Eye contact
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.220]   I remember years ago
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.400]   I went to a friend's church
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.280]   Because our church
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:03.940]   Was so young
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.260]   And my friend's church
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:05.520]   Was
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.860]   Were a bit older
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.800]   And there were people
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.740]   My age or older
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.260]   And I remember
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.300]   After giving the sermon
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:10.920]   We would sit
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.540]   And have lunch
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.100]   And the conversation
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.100]   Topic of the conversation
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.220]   Is what medication
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:15.820]   We were on
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.940]   So
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.240]   I thought I was always
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.340]   The weird one at church
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:20.800]   Because
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.760]   You know
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.540]   I have so many things
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.320]   That I need to take
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.300]   But I was at that church
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:25.620]   Thinking
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.220]   You know
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.060]   After two hours
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.020]   And over the weekend
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.500]   Came back
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:28.760]   It's like
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.320]   Huh
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.020]   I fellowshiped at this church
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.220]   I connected
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.080]   We're very aware
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.100]   That our body
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.020]   Is decaying
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.120]   But when he says
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:40.900]   It is perishable
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.400]   He's not just
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.360]   Simply talking about
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.800]   The body itself
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.580]   When it says
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.060]   Decaying
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.360]   It means
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.020]   It's temporary
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.060]   Well you and I
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.780]   Experience
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.880]   The good
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.320]   And the bad
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.580]   Is temporary
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.020]   I remember
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.780]   The first time
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.980]   That this struck me
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.100]   Was when my parents
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:00.880]   Decided to move out
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.320]   To Korea
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:01.900]   Because they were
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.080]   Having such a hard time
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:03.940]   Paying bills here
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.120]   And my dad
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.360]   Got some part time job
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:06.920]   Out in Korea
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.360]   And at least
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.040]   They can survive
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.540]   Over there
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.020]   And this is when
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.000]   I think a year
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:11.840]   Into my marriage
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.720]   And my parents
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.540]   Packed up their bags
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.240]   To go out to Korea
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.900]   And I knew
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.000]   That our life
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.820]   Was going to be different
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.320]   Because
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.840]   No matter what happened
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.680]   We were always together
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.740]   But the fact that
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.200]   My dad
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:22.940]   My mom
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.740]   Was going to go out to Korea
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.900]   And they were out there
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.420]   Maybe about seven
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:25.860]   Eight years
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.480]   During that time
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.200]   Maybe we saw them
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.360]   Maybe three or four times
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.600]   But I remember
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.860]   Taking my dad
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.320]   To the airport
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:32.880]   Thinking
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.300]   This is it
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.600]   Not that
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.440]   Not that something
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.780]   Tragic was happening
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.360]   But our
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.600]   Stage of life
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.440]   Is changing
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.220]   Even though
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:43.640]   I was already
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.420]   Outside the house
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.920]   Married
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.360]   But this
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.060]   Close contact with them
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.320]   That stage of my life
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:49.660]   Is over
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.060]   And I remember
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.060]   Feeling so sad
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.460]   That something
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.420]   That was so precious
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.420]   To me when I was younger
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.940]   That we have to move on
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.440]   Another time
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:58.920]   I remember
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.860]   When this is hitting
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.900]   When my kids
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.700]   Now they're older
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.260]   When Jeremy
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:03.880]   My oldest son
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.540]   Was getting married
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.680]   You know
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.240]   A lot of people
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.180]   Cry at weddings
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.120]   That's a strange
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.860]   Place to cry
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.440]   It's a time
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.060]   To celebrate
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.960]   And people are
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.600]   Celebrating
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:13.960]   You know
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.200]   They're dancing
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.140]   And usually
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.660]   The people
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.160]   Who cry
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:18.960]   Are the parents
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.780]   From a parent's
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.240]   Perspective
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:22.920]   I can see why
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.260]   I remember
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.040]   The Thursday
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.160]   Before he got married
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.760]   We're sitting there
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.480]   Thinking and we were
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.000]   All sharing
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.100]   With our family
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:28.860]   And the brother
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.400]   And sister
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.480]   Was sharing with him
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.200]   And we're praying
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:31.880]   For him
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.900]   And I remember
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.020]   Sharing from this day on
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:34.660]   Even though he's
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.380]   Going to be at the church
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:35.880]   We're going to still
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.420]   See him
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.220]   But we're headed
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:38.840]   Into a different
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.600]   Stage of life
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.400]   That when
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.400]   From this point on
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.160]   When he gets married
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:43.680]   On Saturday
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.300]   When he says
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:44.760]   His family
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.200]   He's going to be
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:45.780]   Talking about him
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.200]   In diamond
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.300]   We're going to be
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.320]   The extended family
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.020]   We're the extended family
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.600]   I see a lot of parents
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.800]   They would buy
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.420]   Grave sites
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:54.980]   And they would buy
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:55.560]   For them
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.180]   Their wife
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.020]   And then their children
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:57.860]   Not realizing
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.900]   When they get older
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.620]   They're going to buy
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:00.580]   For their wives
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.580]   And their children
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.780]   We live in this
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.700]   Temporary body
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.580]   And whether
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:08.420]   We are living
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.980]   With the sadness
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:11.780]   Of just moving on
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.520]   Decaying
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.400]   Whether it is
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:14.900]   Friends
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.880]   I know that
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.020]   Just in a recent period
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.060]   There's a lot of you
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.720]   For whatever the reason
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.060]   Suddenly lost your mom
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:23.680]   Your dad
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.220]   And we had to go
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.100]   To more funerals
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.300]   In the last six months
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.160]   Than I remember
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:28.820]   In the last five
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.420]   Six years
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.780]   But the sadness
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.660]   That comes from
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:33.260]   Living in this
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.240]   Perishable body
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.580]   The scripture tells us
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.360]   That we will be buried
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.480]   We will be sown
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.320]   Perishable
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.680]   But one day
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.460]   We will rise
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.520]   Imperishable
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.420]   The sadness
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:45.960]   Of living
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.160]   In a decaying world
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.360]   Will be gone
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.240]   When he comes
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.800]   First Thessalonians
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.820]   4 16 to 18
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:52.060]   It says
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.940]   For the Lord himself
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.980]   Will descend from heaven
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.940]   With a shout
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:55.540]   With the voice
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.180]   Of the archangel
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:56.920]   And with the trumpet
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.400]   Of God
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.880]   The dead in Christ
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.940]   Will rise first
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.280]   Then we who are
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.160]   Alive remain
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.940]   Will be caught up
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.660]   Together with them
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.260]   In the clouds
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.900]   To meet the Lord
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.320]   In the air
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.520]   And so we shall
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.700]   Always be with the Lord
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.940]   Therefore comfort one another
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.040]   With these words
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.700]   We will be with the Lord
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.420]   And we will be with one another
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.560]   For eternity
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.720]   We will be sown perishable
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.640]   But we will be raised
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.380]   Imperishable
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.360]   He said we will be sown
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.280]   In dishonor
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.120]   But raised in glory
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.480]   The word for dishonor
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.520]   Is also translated shame
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:31.980]   And I think if I mention shame
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.580]   The first place
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.720]   Where that is recorded
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.560]   Is Adam and Eve
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.800]   Adam and Eve
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.820]   Was physically
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.960]   One person
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.260]   God saw Adam
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:46.020]   And said it was not good
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.840]   For him to be alone
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.740]   He took
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.740]   The ribs
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.640]   From his side
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   His own bones
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.480]   And own flesh
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.800]   And God created Eve
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.560]   So you couldn't be
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.720]   Closer to each other
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.920]   Than Adam and Eve
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.960]   But as soon as sin enters
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.020]   You know what happens
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.600]   These two people
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.960]   Who are literally
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.640]   One person
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.460]   Who became two
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.460]   Decided to hide
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.580]   They made covering
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.480]   Was it all of a sudden
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.160]   They were ashamed
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.200]   Of their body parts
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.700]   Clearly
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:17.440]   The shame
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.300]   Was not physical
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.640]   But it was spiritual
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.700]   And that's exactly
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.580]   What sin does
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:24.840]   When sin comes in
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.480]   Automatically
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.100]   There's guilt
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:26.720]   And shame
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.660]   And when guilt
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.140]   And shame
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:28.720]   Comes in
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.520]   We end up hiding
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.640]   Every single one of us
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.140]   In this room
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.100]   To some degree
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.100]   To some level
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.980]   We hide
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.900]   And when we hide
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.780]   We isolate
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.800]   In isolation
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.760]   We become lonely
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.460]   And loneliness
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.100]   Turns into
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.200]   Despair
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.580]   So many people
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.780]   Are struggling
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.480]   With depression
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.540]   And at the root
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:54.320]   Cause of that
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.360]   Is isolation
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.540]   And the scripture
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.000]   Says
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.940]   That we will be
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.400]   Sown in dishonor
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.060]   But we will be
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:01.780]   Raised
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.020]   In glory
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:07.820]   Colossians 3
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.540]   3-4 says
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:09.360]   For you have died
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.140]   And your life
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.760]   Is hidden with
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.560]   Christ in God
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.480]   When Christ
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.120]   Who is our life
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:13.740]   Is revealed
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.780]   Then you also
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.440]   Will be revealed
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.900]   With him
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.400]   In glory
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.660]   In glory
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.300]   That in his
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.980]   Presence
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.240]   All the shame
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.700]   Even as Christians
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.340]   Even as Christians
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.380]   Even between husband
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.000]   And wife
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.960]   We are never
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.180]   Fully open
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.460]   We are more open
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.140]   Because we can't
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.880]   Hide from each other
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.680]   And some of the
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.300]   Marriage problems
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:39.960]   Happens because
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.720]   We can't hide
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.600]   We hid from
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.340]   Everybody else
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.120]   But all of a sudden
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.820]   You have this
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.440]   Relationship
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:44.980]   Where they see
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:45.460]   Everything
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.000]   And you're
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.560]   Uncomfortable
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.080]   With the fact
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.600]   That they see
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.240]   Everything
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.540]   So even in a
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.740]   Very good
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.380]   Relationship
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:54.900]   You're never
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.260]   Fully 100%
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:56.680]   Open
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.060]   And as a result
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:58:59.440]   Of that
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:58:59.840]   It causes
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:00.380]   All kinds of
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:00.760]   Conflict
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.460]   Because everything
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.160]   That we communicate
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:02.740]   With each other
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.260]   Comes through
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.140]   A sinful filter
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.040]   Why are you
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.520]   Wearing that
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.020]   Oh you hate me
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.660]   Why do you
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:12.160]   Judge me
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.380]   I remember
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.380]   Early on
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:15.720]   As a youth
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.000]   Pastor
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.640]   I was at church
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:16.980]   And I say
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.640]   Oh that's a nice
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.000]   Dress
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.660]   And the first
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:19.060]   Thing that I
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:19.480]   Heard was
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.000]   What about
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.500]   Last week's
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:22.740]   Dress
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.900]   Do I dress
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.300]   Like a bum
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:25.800]   Every day
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.860]   Like why
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.020]   Why are you
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:28.580]   Judging me
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:28.980]   I said
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.080]   It was a nice
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.560]   Dress
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.460]   Everything that
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:33.880]   We say
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.420]   Everything we
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:34.740]   Hear
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.220]   Comes through
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:35.580]   A sinful
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.040]   Filter
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.480]   Of some
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.320]   Past sin
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.400]   Some hurt
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.840]   Some pain
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.420]   And as a result
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:42.420]   And as a result
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:42.940]   Of that
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.220]   It causes
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:44.660]   All kinds
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.300]   Of isolation
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.040]   And difficulty
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.980]   And he says
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.600]   But when he
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.160]   Comes
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:49.860]   We'll be
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:50.760]   Delivered
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.680]   From
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.540]   Shame
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.180]   And we
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:55.620]   Will be
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.520]   In glory
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.340]   Second
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:57.660]   Corinthians
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:57.880]   3
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:58.140]   18
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:58.680]   But we
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.360]   All
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.020]   With unveiled
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.240]   Faith
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.760]   Beholding
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.140]   As in a
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:01.300]   Mirror
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:01.720]   The glory
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:01.960]   Of the
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.160]   Lord
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:02.880]   And being
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.600]   Transformed
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.100]   The same
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.340]   Image
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:04.880]   From glory
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.460]   To glory
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:05.900]   Just as
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.260]   From the
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:06.580]   Lord
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.440]   The Spirit
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.400]   Can you
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:10.780]   Imagine
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.140]   Imagine
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.460]   The most
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:14.880]   Intimate
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.140]   Period
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:16.540]   That you
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:16.920]   Had with
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.200]   God
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.720]   Every single
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.220]   One of us
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:19.780]   God opened
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.220]   Our eyes
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:20.660]   I mean
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.220]   Those of you
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:21.540]   Who are
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.000]   Believers
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.560]   In Christ
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.820]   It's because
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.500]   Our eyes
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:24.940]   Were opened
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.600]   Somebody preached
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:25.980]   The gospel
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.580]   And we saw
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.000]   The glory
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.460]   Of the gospel
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:27.820]   Of Jesus
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.260]   Christ
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.280]   And we
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:29.740]   Wanted
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.140]   That
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.300]   And so
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.000]   We repented
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.520]   We turned
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:32.880]   From this
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.160]   World
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.800]   To follow
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.620]   Christ
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.400]   And so
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:36.940]   We come
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.960]   Hoping
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.860]   That in
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.360]   Some way
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:40.840]   In some
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.400]   Small way
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:41.700]   In big
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:41.840]   Way
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.120]   That we
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:42.360]   Would have
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:42.740]   A greater
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.140]   Glimpse
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.400]   Of that
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:43.720]   Glory
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.360]   And he
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:44.560]   Says
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.040]   Everything
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:45.420]   That you
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.620]   And I
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.060]   Experience
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:46.960]   Is temporary
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.880]   And it
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.100]   Is like
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.540]   A child
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:49.900]   The bible
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:50.340]   Says
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.180]   But when
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:52.780]   He comes
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.160]   He said
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:53.500]   We will
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:53.840]   See his
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.180]   Glory
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.040]   As he

[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.320]   Christ
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.180]   I
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.140]   Live
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:51.640]   As
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.300]   In
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:52.520]   The
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.400]   Ground
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.160]   His
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:54.900]   Body
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.240]   Lay
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.400]   Light
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:57.640]   All
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:57.820]   The
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.180]   World
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:58.600]   By
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.100]   Darkness
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.180]   Slain
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.100]   Then
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.160]   Bursting
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:03.900]   For
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.740]   In
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.680]   Glorious
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.100]   Days
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:07.960]   Up
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.200]   From
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:08.400]   The
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:08.860]   Grave
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.140]   He
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.600]   Rose
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.580]   Again
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.880]   And
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.320]   As
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:13.660]   He
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.060]   Stands
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:15.520]   In
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.420]   Victory
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.080]   Sin's
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:18.620]   Curse
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:18.980]   Has
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.080]   Lost
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:20.760]   Its
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.140]   Grip
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:21.580]   On
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.460]   Me
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.360]   For
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.060]   I
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:24.360]   Am
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.240]   Him
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.060]   And
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:26.540]   He
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:26.960]   Is
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.160]   Mine
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.100]   But
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:29.380]   With
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:29.560]   The
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.400]   Precious
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.360]   Blood
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.240]   Of
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.540]   Christ
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:15:03.520]   guitar solo
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:33.500]   guitar solo
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:16:03.480]   guitar solo
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:03.880]   Let's pray.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.820]   Romans 6, 5-7
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.180]   For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.660]   certainly we shall also be like in the likeness of his resurrection.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.160]   Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him,
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.280]   in order that our body of sin might be done away with,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.560]   so that we would no longer be slaves to sin,
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.400]   for he who has died is freed from sin.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.720]   Father, we pray that all that we have celebrated and remembered this week
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.720]   would have lasting effect, Father God, for the rest of this year, rest of our lives.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.800]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.380]   to adore him, to love him, to follow him and obey him, and to worship him.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.860]   May Christ and Christ alone be magnified in our lives.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:48.680]   Amen.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:48.720]   Amen.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   Amen.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:17:18.700]   Let us pray.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:33.820]   To my mind falling, an empty grave is there to fill my Savior lives.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:43.820]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:55.660]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:06.560]   Because I know, He holds the future.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:17.500]   And life is worth the living, just because He lives.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:25.640]   And stormy gale, my anchor holds way.
