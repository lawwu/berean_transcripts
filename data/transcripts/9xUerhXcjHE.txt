[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.380]   Happy Easter, happy Resurrection Day.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.000]   Hallelujah that every year we are able to celebrate
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.920]   that our Lord has risen, that he has conquered death,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.760]   and that he is alive, reigning today and forevermore.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.340]   So as we begin our service this morning,
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.560]   let us sing "Come, Behold the Wondrous Mystery"
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.420]   as we rejoice in this great gospel
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.880]   by which we have been saved.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.140]   (gentle music)

[00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   - All right, good morning.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   Welcome to Broom Community Church.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   As you guys know, we had a very busy week this week,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   starting from Palm Sunday.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   we had our Passover meal.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   This Friday, we had our Good Friday Communion service.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   We had our early rise service this morning,
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   and then now we're gonna be celebrating
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   the resurrection of Christ.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   Again, it reminds me of Acts chapter two.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   It says that the church was filled with awe,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   and they were gathering together daily
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   to celebrate, to fellowship, to break bread,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   to pray together.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   And so we kind of, the culture that we have created
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   in the Western church where this is something
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   that we do on Sunday, and then we kind of come,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   and then if it's inconvenient, we don't come.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   But in the early church, part of the reason
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   why the church exploded is because people
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   were so consumed with the things of God,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   and they couldn't have enough.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   And so even though we do this once a year,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   to me, it's a week that I look forward to every year.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   At the end of it, there's a lot of people tired.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   There's people who've been working all day yesterday
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   just cooking and prepping.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   And so there will be lunch after service.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   But at the end of it, ultimately, it's not simply
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.920]   because it's a special week of us gathering together
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   for the purpose of the church.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   But at the end of the day, it's to remind us
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   and refresh us that what we celebrated this week
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   is at the center of our lives.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   It's not just something that's important,
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.920]   but it is everything.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   And so what we celebrate this morning,
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.920]   the resurrection of Christ, hopefully,
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   again, if you've been walking with us
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   through the whole week, that it will have
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   a deeper impact on you than possibly it would have
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   if you didn't.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   So a few things that I want to mention
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   before we start are Berean Service Auction
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   for mission funding.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   Today is the last day to sign up.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   So if you're going to sign up to submit
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   any kind of services, please sign up today.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   Cleaning Day is coming this Saturday.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   They are saying that they need about 35
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   or more people to show.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   So if you are able to come and help us
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   at 9 a.m. this Saturday,
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   and they'll tell you what to do at that time.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   And then next session of membership class
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   is going to be starting next Sunday at 9.30 a.m.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   It's an eight-week course.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   If you are interested in becoming a member,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   please sign up for that.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   And then you can attend that,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   and you'll get more information on that.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   And that's starting next Saturday.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.920]   Members Meeting is happening on May 4th
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   at 2 p.m. in the main sanctuary.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   And so if you are a member,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   there is going to be a service fair afterwards.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920]   So if you're interested in,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   especially those of you who are newer,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   and you want to find out what's going on at church,
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   that fair is going to be able to show you
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   where you can get involved.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   And there will be lunch,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   Korea Missions Lunch.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   I think it's Korea Mission.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   Yeah, Korea Missions Lunch
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   is going to be provided
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   right before the Members Meeting.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   If you're part of the Jubilee Fellowship,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   if you are 50 and over,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   and you're part of that fellowship,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   next Sunday there is a lunch happening
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   at 1 p.m. at the Youth Chapel.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   Again, the cost for adults is 10,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   and if you have children who are younger,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   it'll be 5.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   So please sign up for that.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   And then Easter Resource Booth.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   So if you came here as a guest to participate,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   or just you were invited here,
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   and after the service,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   if you have other questions about your faith,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   about things that you've heard,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   there is a Resource Booth.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   If you go outside,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   you probably saw it when you were coming in.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   There's a blue canopy,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   and underneath that,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   there's going to be our Outreach Team.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   Pastor Mark is going to be there.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   So if you have any questions
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   about anything that you've heard,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   any questions about Christianity,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   that's the table you want to go to.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   They have resources that they can give you
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920]   that if you don't have time today,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.920]   that you can read later.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   So please visit that table after the service.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   And then there are also lunch provided.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   So please stick around.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   You saw the chairs and tables that are set up.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   There's also extra chairs and tables
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920]   in the youth room.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   So you can go in there and eat as well.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   So after this service,
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   you can visit that.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   If you're new,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   you can visit the welcome table.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   And for the rest of us,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   there will be lunch provided.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   And I think that's it for the announcements.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   Let me pray for us,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   and then if you have physical offering,
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   there is a box in the back
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   for the rest of us you can give online.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   We thank you for this whole week, Lord God,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   as we had an opportunity
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   to walk through the last week of Christ
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   and the suffering that he went through
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   in order that we may have life
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   and have this life abundantly.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   Help us, Lord God,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   to be reminded of your grace and your love
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   that our life may be a reasonable response
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   to all that you've given us.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   Help us, Lord, that even in this giving,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   that it may be given with gratitude.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   It may be given in joy abundantly, Lord God.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   It may be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   - Thank you, Berean Choir.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   We have so many gifted and talented people,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   not just the singers, but the choir director, Ohi,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   and then there's another brother who put the piece together,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   James Tang, and even though they're gifted,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   I know that they have been meeting together on--
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   I don't know how many times that they met
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   to practice what they were practicing,
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   but, you know, when we get to heaven,
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   the scene of heaven is described as people who are in choir,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   basically singing and praising God,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   and that's the scene that the Bible describes for us,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   what heaven is going to be like.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   So when we enter heaven, I feel like that's a taste
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   of what you're going to see.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   And just--it's one thing.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   I mean, the praise is great with the music
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   and, you know, different gifts, but, you know,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.920]   what honors God is the voice of his people,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   singing praise, a genuine praise and worship
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   that comes out of our hearts and through our mouths.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   So, you know, I look forward to it every year.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   Long time ago, before all this, you know, praise team came in,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   the choir was kind of a regular staple at church,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   so almost every church you went to, they sang choirs,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   but, you know, for whatever reason, that kind of drifted out,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   so being able to see that even once in a while
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   is a true blessing.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   I'm going to be in--starting from this text,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   but I'm going to be jumping around in various passages
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   on the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   and the hope that we have.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   1 Corinthians 15, 13-19, reading out of the NASB.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   "But if there is no resurrection of the dead,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   not even Christ has been raised.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   And if Christ has not been raised,
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   then our preaching is in vain.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   Your faith also is vain.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Moreover, we are even found to be false witnesses of God,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   because we testified against God that he raised Christ,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.920]   And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   You are still in your sins.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   If we have hoped in Christ in this life only,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   we are all men most to be pitied."
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   Let's pray.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   We thank you for this whole week.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   We thank you, Father God, that it is your mercy that carries us,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   that causes us to persevere,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   causes us to see your glory.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   We pray this morning as we meditate
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   upon the resurrection of Christ and what it means for us.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   I pray that that hope will become so clear
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   that our hearts, our minds, our lives
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   may be directed and empowered by it.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   May your name be magnified. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   Just as a text that we read, it says,
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   "If Christ has not been raised, our faith is futile."
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   Everything that you and I are doing every single week,
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   every single Bible study, hinges upon the truth
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   If you are a guest here,
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   or maybe even if you've been a Christian
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   and you haven't really meditated on it for a while,
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   and the resurrection doesn't seem real,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   because you've never seen it.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   You've heard it, and you believe it,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   but you've never personally seen it.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.920]   As a result of that, maybe your faith is weak.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   You just kind of assume it,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   and it doesn't make the impact that it should.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   Or maybe you're here as a guest,
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   and you've never encountered this Christ,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   the resurrected Christ,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   and you have a hard time believing it.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   If that's you, you're not alone.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   Because the New Testament account tells us
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.920]   that even the disciples had a hard time believing this.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   When Jesus told them that he was going to die
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.920]   and be resurrected, and then he was actually crucified,
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   they never even went to check
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   because they couldn't believe it.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   You have to remember, these are people
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   who are witnesses of Jesus walking on water.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   He healed the sick.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.920]   He raised Lazarus from the dead.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   And yet, when Christ died,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   they thought it was over.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   You ever hear the term, you know,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   you're beating a dead horse?
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   Beating a dead horse basically means his hope is gone.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   There's no point in waiting.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   There's no point in seeking. It's over.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   And so when Christ was crucified,
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   it was done for them, and they were completely lost.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   Even when Jesus shows up,
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   they couldn't believe their eyes.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   Could that really be? How can this be you?
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   So Thomas asked, "Let me see your scars.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   Let me see if this is really you."
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   So he had to touch his scars,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   and Jesus had to show him that it was him.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   And then they finally realized,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   "Oh my gosh, he was resurrected."
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   And only in retrospect, they look back and say,
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   "He's been telling us this,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   and it actually happened."
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   Well, Jesus himself said,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   when people asked him,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   "You're claiming some crazy things.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   Prove yourself. What are the signs?"
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   And Jesus says, "I will leave you a sign of Jonah,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   his death and resurrection."
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.920]   I want to give you two quotes from two non-Christians,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   because I don't want to quote Christians,
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   in case you say, "Of course Christians are going to say that."
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   The first one is from Paula Fredrickens,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   who is a Jewish scholar, a well-known Jewish scholar,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   and this is what she says,
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   "I know in their own terms,"
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   the early church,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   "what they saw was the raised Jesus."
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   That's what they say,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   and then all the historical evidence
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   we have afterward attests to their conviction
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   that that's what they saw.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   Now obviously Paula was not there,
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   but she's looking at all the evidence
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   of the people that they studied
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   in the early church,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.920]   that whether you believe it or not,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   it is clear that they believed it.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   Gerd Ludmann,
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.920]   who's actually a known atheist,
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   he doesn't even have faith,
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   but he's a New Testament scholar,
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   and after studying the historical evidence
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   of Jesus' resurrection,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   this is what he says,
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   "It may be taken as a historical certain
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   that Peter and the disciples had experiences
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.920]   after Jesus' death in which Jesus appeared to them
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   as the risen Christ."
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   There is no serious New Testament scholar
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   who refutes that something happened,
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   because when you look at it,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   so many people gave their lives.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   A radical change of Jews and Gentiles
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   who despised each other
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   all of a sudden started calling each other
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   That would be a crazier story
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   than if you fell asleep for a few days
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   and woke up and said that the Republicans
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   and the Democrats became one party.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   They reconciled, and now they're going to be one party.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   They're going to be united.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   That's much easier to grasp
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   than the Jews and Gentiles,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   because Jews and Gentiles hated each other
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   for thousands of years.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   It wasn't just political, it was spiritual.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   But that's what happened.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   You had runaway slaves and slave owners
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   sit together and call each other
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   brothers in Christ.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   You had people who had PhD in religion
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   sitting and listening to teachings
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.920]   from a tax collector,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   from someone who's never been educated.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.920]   What happened?
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   You notice here the text that we're looking at
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   in 1 Corinthians 15, 13-19.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   He's not trying to argue the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   He's arguing the resurrection of people,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   of the followers of Jesus,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   because the resurrection of Jesus
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   didn't need proof, because the people
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   who saw the resurrected Christ
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   existed when this letter was being written.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   400 separate people, aside of the disciples,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   saw, physically, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   So you notice here, he says,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   of course people are raised, if people are not raised,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   and even Jesus wasn't raised.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   Now, I don't need to convince you of that,
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   because there's over 500 people who are eyewitnesses.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   In fact, in the early church,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   so many of them gave their lives
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   attesting to this truth,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   that many people ended up becoming Christians
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.920]   simply by their testimony.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   How many people go to the grave
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   if this is all a lie?
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   If this was just propaganda
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   for their own benefit?
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   Clearly, they're not benefiting.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   You have people who are giving their lives,
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   become poverty, who are being thrown out of synagogues,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   in their homes, they're losing their businesses,
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   in the hundreds and in the thousands.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   How can they,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   if it is for their own benefit, be doing that?
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   So that's why even the secular scholars,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   when they study the proof of the resurrection,
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.920]   they say, "Well, whether it happened or not,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   "we're not sure, but one thing we do know
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.920]   "is they believed it."
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   Hundreds of people who are eyewitnesses,
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   for sure they believed it.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   So the people who are trying to refute this
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.920]   comes up with theories and say,
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.920]   "Well, they clearly saw something.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   "Something miraculous must have happened,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   "at least in their sight, so maybe it was
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   "the twin brother of Jesus."
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   As ridiculous as that sounds, that's one of the theories
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   that they've been given.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   Another theory they call the Swoon Theory,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   where Jesus just kind of fainted.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   He fainted, right?
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   He survived the cross, and he fainted,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   and then he just got back up,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   and then he started going around
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   and talking about who he is.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   They're all the ridiculous theories
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   that came out because they don't understand
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   how can somebody come back from the dead?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   But that's exactly what we are here to celebrate,
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.920]   and that's exactly what happened 2,000 years ago,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   and that is the reason why
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   the impact of the resurrection
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   has impacted all of mankind since then,
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   and even that is not refuted.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.920]   Whether you love Christ or hate Christ,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   there is no argument that this single event
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   has shifted the course of human history.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.920]   What did the resurrection prove?
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.920]   Well, number one, it tells us
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   without a shadow of a doubt
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   that what Jesus said about himself is true.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.920]   Romans 1 through 4 says, "Concerning his son,
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   who was born of a descendant of David,
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   according to the flesh,
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   who was declared the Son of God with power
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.920]   by the resurrection from the dead."
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   He made it very clear who he was.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   In fact, when he asked the disciples,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   He wanted to make sure that they understood
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.920]   who he was, and then he confirmed it
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   through his death and resurrection
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   that he is the Son of the living God.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   Now, why is that so important?
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   Outside of the fact that God walked among us,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   the God of the universe emptied himself
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.920]   and walked among us, great!
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   We can celebrate, we can sing about that,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.920]   but what is the impact of that to you and I?
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.920]   The reason why the declaration of his deity,
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   that he is the Son of God,
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   he is who he says he was,
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   is so important.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   It's because Jesus claimed
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   that he had the power of life and death.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   He had the power of life and death.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   Imagine today if somebody came up
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   with a new invention,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   and if you swallow this pill, right,
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   that you're going to be able to extend your life
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   for another 50 years, right?
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   That man, my guess,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.920]   is probably going to be the richest man on earth.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   People will pay whatever they have.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   They'll empty their bank accounts,
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   they'll sell their homes,
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   especially if they're at the tarot
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   under their life,
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   to just extend it for another 50 years.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   Because ever since we are born,
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.920]   ever since we were born into this world,
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.920]   our core value,
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   our core motivation is to live.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   Even an infant that is born,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   from the moment that it is born,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   is looking for milk.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   Who taught him that?
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   They come and he's gasping for air
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   and trying to survive.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   Who taught him that?
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   It wasn't years of training.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   He's innately born to live.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   Everything that we do from that moment on
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   is so that we can have a better life.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   We go to school, we work hard,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   you get degrees, you make investments,
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   you put money away, you buy houses.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   Everything that we do
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   is so that we can have a better life.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   What Jesus says in John 10, 17-18,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   "For this reason the Father loves me,
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   "because I lay down my life
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   "so that I may take it again.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   "No one has taken it away from me,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   "but I lay it down on my own initiative.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   "I have authority to lay it down
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   "and I have authority to take it up again.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   "This commandment I receive from the Father."
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   He says he is the author of life.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   Now anybody can put it down,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   but he says he has power to raise it up.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   And then in John 5, 21,
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   "For just as the Father raises the dead
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   "and gives him life,
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   "even so the Son also gives life
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   "to whom he wishes."
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.920]   Not only can he lay his life down
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   and raise it back up,
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   but he says he has the power
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   to give that life to anybody.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   His resurrection, his declaration
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   of him being the Son of God meant
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   that what he said was true.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   Now why do we even need life?
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   Aren't we living?
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   Well, Romans 5, 12 says,
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.920]   "Therefore just as through the one man's sin
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   "entered into the world,
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   "the death came through sin,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   "and so death spread to all men,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   "because all sinned."
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   Now we may be physically living.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   Whether you are young or whether you are old,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   we have biological life.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   But when the Bible talks about death,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   it's not just the physical.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   It's also the spiritual.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   Romans 5, 17 says,
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   "For if by the transgression of one,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   "death reigned through the one."
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   We didn't just experience death.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   The Bible says that death reigns.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   So what does it mean to reign?
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   Typically, we think of a king.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   We live in a democratic republic,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   so we hear stories
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   or we watch movies about a king.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   But we can get the gist of what that means.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   For a king to reign
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   is that every part of his kingdom,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   he's the final say.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   He affects everything that happens in that kingdom.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   That's what it means for the king to reign.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   But the Scripture says,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.920]   "Death reigns over all mankind."
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   In other words, everything that you and I experience
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   on this earth, this physical earth,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   it has something to do with death.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   It has an effect on everything that we do.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   It affects our marriage.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   It affects our family.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   It affects our work.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   It affects our leisure.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   It affects our economy.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   It affects our politics.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   The central thing that affects everything that we do
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   is not who's in the White House.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   It's not the economic trend.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   It's not what's going to happen with the tariff.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   All of these things are minor
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   in comparison to what the Scripture says.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   It is sin and death that reigns.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   All these other things are ramifications of that.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   Jesus Christ says He came to deal with that sin.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   I think the struggle is oftentimes
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   in our day-to-day life,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   we don't feel the effect of sin.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   Let me illustrate this point to you.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   We have five senses.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   We have hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and seeing.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   Out of the five senses,
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   if I was to ask you to choose one sense
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   that if you were to get rid of it,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   I can live without it,
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   which one would you choose?
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   Anybody would choose sight?
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   Yeah, that's typical.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.920]   Of the five, which one would you choose?
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   According to statisticians
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   who went and actually asked people,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   78% of the people asked
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.920]   said that they chose smell.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   I'm assuming that kind of represented of this group,
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   about 70%, almost 80% smell.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   The reason why we choose smell
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   is because if you lose smell,
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   no one can tell but you.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   You look the same.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920]   You sound the same.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   I don't know if it's going to change your vocal sounds,
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.920]   but it said no one's going to tell except you.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   But smell is directly related to appetite.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.920]   So you say, "What's the big deal?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.920]   "I can live bland.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   "I don't like spicy things anyway."
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.920]   They said that smell is also
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   somehow related to understanding danger.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.920]   I don't know how that works.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.920]   Those of you guys who are doctors
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   and biologists and researchers,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   you can refute that,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   but that's what it said,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   the researcher said.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   Another thing that it does is
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   because you lose the sense of smell,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   you lose the sense of hygiene
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   because you can't smell yourself.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   Now, all of these things seem minor,
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   but is it?
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   If you can't smell yourself,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   you're walking out of the house
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   and you smell.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   You stink.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   What ramification does it have?
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   You're going to lose some friends.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   You're going to sit in the church
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.920]   with nobody around you.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   It has social effects.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   In fact, it says the sense of smell
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   is directly related to how we relate to one another.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   A sense of connection, affection,
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   is related to the sense of smell.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   So they say that whether by an accident
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   or whether by genetic defect
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   or whatever it may be,
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   it said that 60% of people
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.920]   who lose their smell
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   have a very difficult time connecting with people
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   and it ultimately leads to depression
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   and isolation.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   Now, on the surface,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   we would have never known that.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   It's only through the studies
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   that people found how important smell is
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   to community and relating to one another.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   I say all of this because oftentimes
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   we don't see the direct effect of sin.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   When we are filled with pride
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   and anger and bitterness,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   how it affects the community,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   how it affects the people around us,
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.920]   how it affects the relationship that we have,
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   we don't think that's what it is.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   We typically think it must be you
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   because we have a hard time smelling our own sins
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   but we smell other people's sins very clearly.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   We become experts at what other people are doing.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   That's wrong.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   See, when we live under the reign of sin,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   it affects our marriages,
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.920]   it affects our relationship with our children,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   the very things that God has given to us as a gift.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   Now, I've officiated over 100 weddings.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   I don't know exactly what the number is now
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   but I've never officiated a single wedding
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   where there was a single person
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   that came to the altar kicking and screaming
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.920]   that despite the fact that I don't want to get married
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   for the glory of God.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   Right?
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   No.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.920]   They're the ones kicking and screaming to get to the altar.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   They're the ones fighting with their parents,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   fighting with everybody else.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   I'm going to get there no matter what.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   I've never officiated a wedding
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   where either of the party came kicking and screaming
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   because it was a gift,
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   because it produces joy
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   and yet years later,
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.920]   some of the greatest heartaches in life
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   comes from this marriage.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   Some of the greatest pain that you experience
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   living in this earth is from that union.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   You have kids.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   As soon as a kid comes into the world,
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   there's celebration.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   We celebrate their 100 days,
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   you know, a one year,
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   and the whole community celebrates
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   but some of the greatest pain in life
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   comes from raising children.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   The rebellion, raising another sinner in the home
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   and then adding another sinner in the home
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   and some of the greatest heartaches as parents
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   come from your own children.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   As much as we desire community,
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   the scripture says when sin reigns,
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   it affects everything.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Every good thing that God has given us,
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   it gets perverted because of sin.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   Because all mankind live under the curse of this sin.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   Sin reigns.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.920]   That's what this week represents.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   That Christ left his throne,
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   humbled himself,
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   walked as a humble servant
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   and then he took upon that curse of man
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.920]   on himself on the cross
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   and in his resurrection,
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   he reverses this curse
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   and then promises us
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   that we will do the same.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   The Bible tells us that his resurrection
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   was just the first fruit.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   He didn't just resurrect
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   so that we can celebrate his resurrection.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   He said he resurrected
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   so that he can open the path and the door
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   so that we would also follow in those steps
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   and that's exactly what we want to get at this morning
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   in 1 Corinthians 15, 42-44.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   He describes what that resurrection one day
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   is going to be like for us.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   He says, "So also the resurrection of the dead,
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   it is sown a perishable body,
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   it is raised an imperishable body.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   It is sown in dishonor,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   it is raised in glory,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   it is sown in weakness,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   it is raised in power.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   It is sown a natural body,
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   it is raised in spiritual body.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   If there is a natural body,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   there is also a spiritual body."
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   It is not by accident
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.920]   that Paul used the term "sown"
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   because sowing typically refers to what?
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   Planting, right?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   You plant.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   But what is the purpose of planting?
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   To get rid of the seed
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   so we don't have to see it anymore?
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   Bury it?
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   Because typically when we think of
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   if somebody passes away or dies,
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.920]   we bury them
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.920]   and we don't bury them thinking
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   that something good is going to come out of it.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   We bury them so that
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   the rotting of their flesh
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   that we don't have to see.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   It is deliberate that he uses the term "sow"
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   because when you sow something,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   you sow it in the ground
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   in order for something good,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   a fruit to come from it,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   a plant, a tree,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   something to come from that.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   So now he is basically sown.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   The word "sown" is being used
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   to describe our death.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   Now because of his resurrection,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   we will be sown, he says,
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   perishable,
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   but we'll be raised imperishable.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   If you go to the supermarket
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   and it says perishable,
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   it basically means
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   you have to hurry up and eat it
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   because it's going to rot if you don't.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   Imperishable means
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   you can just leave it outside.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   It's not going to disappear.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   So when he says perishable, imperishable,
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   another way to say that
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   is temporary and eternal.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   Temporary and eternal.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   What we have now is subject to decay.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   It's temporary.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   It's going to pass.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   And the moment that you are born,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   there's some level of decay that happens.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   Some of us are further along in this decay.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.920]   And we're very aware of it.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   I'm very aware of it.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   I remember in my mid-40s,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   I went to the doctor.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Again, those of you who are older may relate.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   We didn't grow up with the Internet.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.920]   TV turned off at 12 o'clock.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.920]   There's nothing to do.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   We didn't have cell phones.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   So if you don't go to sleep,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.920]   you're going to be sitting in the dark.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   There's not much to do.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   So we played a lot of sports.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   Baseball, football, even hockey.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   Basketball was my favorite sport eventually.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   But I remember going to the doctor
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   and the doctor looked at my knee
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   and then he said,
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   "You injured your right knee,
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   "but you never took good care of it
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   "because I kept on playing on it."
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   He said, "Now all the cartilages are loose
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   "and so we're going to have to shave that off."
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   So there's parts of my knees that are bone to bone.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   And then at the end of that he said,
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   "Is there any treatment?"
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   I said, "No, we can just soften the pain,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   "but you can't fix it.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   "Maybe one day they'll come out with technology
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   "where that can be fixed,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   "but right now we don't have it."
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.920]   So I had surgery to shave it off.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   And then the next thing he told me was,
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.920]   "You can't play basketball anymore."
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   Now some of you don't understand
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   the devastation of that.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   That was all we did with free time.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   I played probably three, four times a week at least.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   That's all we did.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   There's no video games,
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   or at least I didn't enjoy playing video games.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   I wasn't into watching K-drama.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   And I was a youth pastor
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   and then became a college pastor,
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.920]   so I was always with young people,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   so I was constantly playing basketball or softball.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   And then him telling me,
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   "You can't play basketball."
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   Some of you guys love golf and say,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   "No, you can't play golf anymore."
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   Some of you guys like running.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   I don't understand you,
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   but you can't run anymore.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   'Cause that was my hobby.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   That's all I did.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   And then he'd say,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   "You can't play that anymore."
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.920]   I remember coming home.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   Some of you may understand.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   I just like, "Hmm, that's over then.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   "That part of my life is over."
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   So I'm very aware.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   Our bodies decay.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.920]   Some of you guys who are younger may not know,
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   but those of you in the Jubilee,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   we just need to make eye contact.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   I remember years ago,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   I went to a friend's church
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   'cause our church was so young,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   and my friend's church were a bit older,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   and there were people my age or older,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   and I remember after giving the sermon,
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   we would sit and have lunch,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   and the topic of the conversation is
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.920]   what medication we were on.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.920]   I thought I was always the weird one at church
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   because I have so many things that I need to take,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   but I was at that church thinking--
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   After two hours and over the weekend came back,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   it's like, "Huh, I fellowshiped at this church.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   "I connected."
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.920]   We're very aware that our body is decaying,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.920]   but when he says it is perishable,
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   he's not just simply talking about the body itself.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   When he says decaying, he means it's temporary.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   What you and I experience,
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   the good and the bad, is temporary.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   I remember the first time that this struck me
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.920]   was when my parents decided to move out to Korea
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   because they were having such a hard time paying bills here,
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.920]   and my dad got some part-time job out in Korea,
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   and at least they can survive over there,
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   and this is when I think a year into my marriage,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.920]   and my parents packed up their bags to go out to Korea,
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   and I knew that our life was going to be different
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   because no matter what happened, we were always together,
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   but the fact that my dad and my mom was going to go out to Korea,
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   and they were out there maybe about seven, eight years.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   During that time, maybe we saw them maybe three or four times,
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   but I remember taking my dad to the airport thinking, "This is it."
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   Not that something tragic was happening,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   but our stage of life is changing.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   Even though I was already outside the house married,
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   but this close contact with them, that stage of my life is over,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   and I remember feeling so sad.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   That's something that was so precious to me when I was younger
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   that we have to move on.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   Another time I remember when this is hitting,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   when my kids now, they're older,
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   when Jeremy, my oldest son, was getting married,
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   a lot of people cry at weddings.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.920]   That's a strange place to cry.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   It's a time to celebrate, and people are celebrating.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   They're dancing.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.920]   Usually, the people who cry are the parents.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   From a parent's perspective, I can see why.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   I remember the Thursday before he got married,
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   we're sitting there thinking, and we were all sharing with our family,
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   and the brother and sister was sharing with him, and we're praying for him.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   I remember sharing from this day on,
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   even though he's going to be at the church, we're going to still see him,
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   but we're headed into a different stage of life.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.920]   From this point on, when he gets married on Saturday,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   when he says his family, he's going to be talking about him and Diamond.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   We're going to be the extended family.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   We're the extended family.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   I see a lot of parents.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   They would buy grave sites, and they would buy for them, their wife,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   and then their children, not realizing when they get older,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   they're going to buy it for their wives and their children.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   We live in this temporary body,
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   and whether we are living with the sadness of just moving on, decaying,
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   whether it is friends.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   I know that just in a recent period, there's a lot of you,
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   for whatever the reason, suddenly lost your mom, your dad,
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   and we had to go to more funerals in the last six months
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   than I remember in the last five, six years.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   But the sadness that comes from living in this perishable body,
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   the scripture tells us that we will be buried.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   We will be sown perishable, but one day we will rise imperishable.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   The sadness of living in a decaying world will be gone when he comes.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   1 Thessalonians 4, 16-18 says,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   "For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   The dead in Christ will rise first.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   Then we who are alive, remain,
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   And so we shall always be with the Lord.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   Therefore, comfort one another with these words."
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:15.920]   We will be with the Lord, and we will be with one another for eternity.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   We will be sown perishable, but we will be raised imperishable.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   He said we will be sown in dishonor, but raised in glory.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   The word for dishonor is also translated shame.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   And I think if I mention shame, the first place where that is recorded is Adam and Eve.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   Adam and Eve was physically one person.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.920]   God saw Adam and said it was not good for him to be alone.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   He took the ribs from his side, his own bones and own flesh, and God created Eve.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   So you couldn't be closer to each other than Adam and Eve.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   But as soon as sin enters, you know what happens.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   These two people, who were literally one person who became two, decided to hide.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   They made covering.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   Was it all of a sudden they were ashamed of their body parts?
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   Clearly the shame was not physical, but it was spiritual.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.920]   And that's exactly what sin does.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   When sin comes in, automatically there's guilt and shame.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   And when guilt and shame comes in, we end up hiding.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   Every single one of us in this room, to some degree, to some level, we hide.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   And when we hide, we isolate.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   In isolation, we become lonely, and loneliness turns into despair.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   So many people are struggling with depression, and at the root cause of that is isolation.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   And the Scripture says that we will be sown in dishonor, but we will be raised in glory.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   Colossians 3, 3-4 says, "For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory."
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.920]   In glory.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:31.920]   That in His presence, all the shame, even as Christians, even as Christians, even between husband and wife,
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.920]   we are never fully open.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   We are more open because we can't hide from each other,
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   and some of the marriage problems happen because we can't hide.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.920]   We hid from everybody else, but all of a sudden, you have this relationship where they see everything.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.920]   And you're uncomfortable with the fact that they see everything.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:57.920]   So even in a very good relationship, you're never fully, 100% open.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   And as a result of that, it causes all kinds of conflict,
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   because everything that we communicate with each other comes through a sinful filter.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.920]   "Why are you wearing that?"
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   "Oh, you hate me?"
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   "Why do you judge me?"
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   I remember early on as a youth pastor, I was at church, and I'd say, "Oh, that's a nice dress."
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   And the first thing that I heard was, "What about last week's dress?"
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   "Do I dress like a bum every day?"
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   "Why are you judging me?"
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   I said, "I said it was a nice dress!"
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   Everything that we say, everything we hear, comes through a sinful filter
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.920]   of some past sin, some hurt, some pain.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   And as a result of that, it causes all kinds of isolation and difficulty.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   And he says, "But when He comes, we'll be delivered from shame, and we will be in glory."
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   2 Corinthians 3.18 says, "But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:09.920]   and being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord the Spirit."
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.920]   Can you imagine?
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   Imagine the most intimate period that you had with God.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   Every single one of us, God opened our eyes.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   I mean, those of you who are believers in Christ, it's because our eyes were open.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   Somebody preached the gospel, and we saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   and we wanted that.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   And so we repented, we turned from this world to follow Christ.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   And so we come hoping that in some way, in some small way, in big way,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   that we would have a greater glimpse of that glory.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   And he says, "Everything that you and I experience is temporary, and it is like a child," the Bible says.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.920]   "But when He comes," he said, "we will see His glory as He is."
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   He says, "We are veiled because we are still in this fleshly body,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   but when He comes and we have our resurrected body,
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   that not only are we going to see His glory as He is, that glory is going to be part of us.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   We're going to be glorified with Christ."
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   That's mind-blowing to me.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   I still remember very vividly the first time I realized that God exists,
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   and that that God loves me.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   Nothing else happened.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   It wasn't years of discipleship.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   It wasn't years of memorizing scripture, going to church.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   Instantaneously, the moment I saw a glimpse of His glory, I was changed.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   To this day, 42 years have passed.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   To this day, that's the greatest event that I can possibly think of.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   I say, "Oh, what about having your kids?"
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   Of course, of course that was huge.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.920]   But compared to the day that I met Christ?
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   And to think that that was just a glimpse.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.920]   That was just a glimpse.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   Heaven is not heaven because you're going to live in mansions,
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.920]   or you're going to have a better knee, or you're going to be taller,
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   or you're going to be dunking the basketball,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   or whatever your wildest dreams may come true.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   Heaven is heaven because we get to see front row seats of the glory of Christ.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   Heaven is not heaven.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   You can have all your wildest dreams come true and not have Christ.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   That's judgment.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.920]   There's no life there.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.920]   He says not only will we see God's glory as He is,
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   He said we're going to participate in that glory.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   We're going to be sown.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   We're going to be sown in dishonor, but we will be raised in glory.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.920]   We're going to be sown in weakness, but raised in power.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   We're going to be sown in weakness.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   The arrogance of mankind.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   You go to the gym, and I've been trying to go back to the gym,
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   and the gym is filled with two kinds of people.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   You have the young people who are working out in front of the mirror.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   They want to see the results.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.920]   Then you have the older people just trying to live a little longer,
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   and we try to avoid the mirror.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   We don't want to see because we don't want to be discouraged.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.920]   The arrogance of mankind, especially when we're young,
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   we don't realize our frailty.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   I think the pandemic, in some sense, was good for mankind
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   because it reminded us of our frailty.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   That tiny little virus that you can't even see with your eyes,
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   that you need to have it magnified a thousand times just to see what that was.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   That, we were afraid of that.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   Everything shut down because of that.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   That's how fragile we are.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   The temperature's a little bit too hot, temperature's a little bit too cold.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   We don't have enough oxygen. You don't eat the right food.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   You don't move around.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.920]   There's so many things that can kill us.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   We don't realize.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   Remember the first time when you started driving, how scared you were?
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   Every time you ran a green light, somebody's going to come and say,
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   "Man, I can die, I can die."
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   And now you're like, "Whatever."
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   Because you got so comfortable.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   Yeah, but that machine that we ride, I mean, think about it.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   One accident, one drunk guy,
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   one guy just forgetting, messing around on the phone,
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.920]   and just running the red light and T-boning us, and that's it.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   That's how fragile our life is.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   A new term came about in our newer generation, snowflake.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   Snowflake basically means you melt easily.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.920]   It's beautiful, but then a little bit of sunlight and it withers.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   That's a new generation term.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   Our generation, we call them pansies.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   It's beautiful, but then without the right sunlight and care and water,
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   they said it dies easily.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   Well, guess what?
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.920]   The Bible says we're all a bunch of snowflakes.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   We're all snowflakes.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   We're all a bunch of pansies.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920]   In Isaiah 46 to be, it says,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   "All flesh is like grass and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   The grass withers, the flowers fade.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   When the breath of the Lord blows upon it, surely the people are grass."
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   The arrogance of mankind is somehow we can exist on our own.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   If we just work harder, if we get sick, we get the right medicine.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   We go to the right doctor.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   If we just work out and take the right medication.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   I figured out how to live, not realizing how fragile we are.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.920]   James 4.14, it says, "Our life is like a mist."
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   A mist.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   That's even weaker than a snowflake.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   That's even weaker than a pansy.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   We're just a mist.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   So, a mist that is proud?
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   Think about the ridiculousness of that.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   A pansy, a snowflake, a mist, who somehow has confidence that I figured this out.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   He said, "We will be sown in weakness, but we're going to be raised one day in power."
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   The power is not within us.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   In Philippians 3.10-11, it says, "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, in order that I may
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   attain to the resurrection from the dead."
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   The power is a union with Christ in his resurrection.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   That even when we die, we live.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.920]   Everything else is human arrogance.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   We will be sown in weakness, but we will be raised in power.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   And finally, it says, "We will be sown in natural body, but raised in spiritual body."
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.920]   The Bible uses the term "natural body" often to refer to the fallen man and his flesh.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.920]   This is what it says in 1 Corinthians 2.14-15, the natural man and the spiritual man.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   "The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   He who is spiritually appraised appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   no one."
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:24.920]   In other words, it says the natural man has a hard time understanding God.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   In his sin, because of his flesh, because of his weakness, even the Word of God comes
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.920]   through the filter of my sin and arrogance and pride.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   So even what we think clearly is blue, isn't blue.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   And he says the reason why that is is because our natural man is so strong, not realizing
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   how weak we are.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   1 Corinthians 13.12 says, "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known."
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   We will be sown in our natural body, but we will be raised in our spiritual body, imperishable,
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   in power, in glory, in our eternal state.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   That's why the Scripture says do not invest in temporary things.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920]   Do not invest in temporary things.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.920]   You work so hard so you can have a retirement.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   You work so hard so you can live in that house.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   You work so hard so you can have some security.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   All of that's not going to fade.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.920]   That's all pansy stuff.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   He said fix your eyes upon Christ, where the true reward is.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   Christ is the reward.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.920]   Our union with Christ is the reward.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   He is not just source of salvation.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   He is our salvation.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   He is heaven.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   He is peace.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.920]   He is life.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   And the resurrection guarantees that one day we will be united permanently with him in glory.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.920]   And we will be in that state for eternity.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   And all that we experience here is going to be a distant memory.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   A distant memory.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.920]   Because that's where we're headed.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.920]   I pray that this day of resurrection is not just something that we study.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:27.920]   Okay, that's what the resurrection is.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.920]   So what does the word "the" mean?
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   The resurrection mean?
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   What does the burial mean?
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   So what?
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920]   So what you have knowledge.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   So what?
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   What is your testimony?
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   What is your testimony?
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   How did the power of the resurrection change you?
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   How did the power of the resurrection change the way you raise your kids?
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.920]   How did the power of the resurrection change the way you saw eternity?
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.920]   How did the power of the resurrection change the way you saw your finance?
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   We're just passing through.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   We're just passing through.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   And as we celebrate and remember the resurrection of Christ,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   I pray that we will be filled with hope that one day we will be there too.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.920]   Let me conclude with reading Revelations 21 through to 4.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   It says, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   'Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and he will dwell among them,
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.920]   and they shall be his people, and God himself will be among them,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.920]   and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   and there will no longer be any death,
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   there will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   The first things have passed away.'"
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   Let's pray.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   Father, we pray for a greater vision of what we have in Christ
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   as we remember and celebrate the resurrection
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.920]   that we would reorient our thoughts toward God
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.920]   to the day that we ourselves will be resurrected,
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   that though we are sown with the things that are temporary,
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   that we would be raised imperishable,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   though we will be sown in dishonor,
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   that we will be raised in glory,
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   though we will be sown in weakness,
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   that we will be raised in power,
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.920]   and though we were sown the natural body,
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.920]   that we will be raised with our spiritual body.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   Help us, Lord God, to eagerly wait for that resurrection,
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.920]   that all our values, all our hopes, all our dreams
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.920]   may be placed upon Christ and Christ alone.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.

[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920]   "For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   "certainly we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.920]   "Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him,
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.920]   "in order that our body of sin might be done away with,

[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   to adore him, to love him, to follow him and obey him,
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920]   and to worship him.
