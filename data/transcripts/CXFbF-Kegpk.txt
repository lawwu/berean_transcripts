[01:26:52.260 --> 01:27:22.240]   Thank you.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:52.220]   Thank you.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:28:22.200]   Thank you.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:52.180]   Thank you.
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:29:22.160]   Thank you.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:52.140]   Thank you.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:30:22.120]   Thank you.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:52.100]   Thank you.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:31:22.080]   Thank you.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:52.060]   Thank you.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:32:22.040]   Thank you.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:52.020]   Thank you.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:33:22.000]   You don't sacrifice.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:51.980]   Thank you.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:34:21.960]   Thank you.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:51.940]   Thank you.
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:35:21.920]   Thank you.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.980]   in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of his covenant between me and the earth, and it shall
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:30.100]   come about when I bring a cloud over the earth, and the bow will be seen
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:33.960]   in the cloud. That's where we get rainbow, right?
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.520]   At least in the Bible, it's not one word,
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.240]   right? It was a bow that was created by the rain, so it's rainbow,
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.000]   right? And then Genesis 9, 16, 17, when the bow is in the cloud,
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.660]   then I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:53.900]   every living creature of all the flesh. And God said to Noah, this is the sign of the
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.580]   covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:01.220]   Okay? So let me ask you again.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:05.340]   He says, when it rains, and you see
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:09.140]   the bow, right? The rainbow, or bow of the rain,
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:13.460]   right? I will not destroy the earth like I did in chapter 7
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.980]   and 8. So what is the purpose of this rainbow?
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.120]   why does he give this covenant to them? Because we know judgment
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.980]   is coming, right?
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:29.360]   Think like you are
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.800]   Noah and his descendants.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.180]   What would that
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.200]   rainbow mean to you?
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.640]   Let me ask you again, because I want you to do some critical thinking, okay?
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:52.060]   What would that covenant, when you see the rain coming, and you see the, you see the rainbow,
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:57.200]   what would that mean to you if you just experienced the flood?
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.160]   Huh?
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.740]   Mercy?
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.340]   What would it have done?
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:08.640]   If you didn't see that, and every time it rains, what would it do to you?
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:11.980]   Where is the boat?
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.900]   Right?
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:16.660]   We got some holes.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.980]   Get the animals back on the boat.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:20.040]   Right?
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.600]   Every time it rains.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.000]   Because just the whole earth got wiped out.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.040]   Right?
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.160]   But rain is necessary.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.060]   So he says, every time it rains,
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:33.000]   you're going to, when you see the bow,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.260]   this is a reminder to you that I will remember
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:35.840]   my covenant,
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.300]   this is not going to happen again.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.600]   How can you possibly live?
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.660]   Right?
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:42.420]   You can't live.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:44.520]   I mean, we're so many years removed from that.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.140]   The flood is,
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:46.960]   it actually happened?
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.660]   Is this real?
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:48.460]   Right?
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.080]   But imagine if it actually happened to you.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.980]   Imagine if you were a flood,
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:52.940]   you survived the flood.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.280]   You're going to,
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.980]   you're going to move away as far as you can
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.140]   from any body of water.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.240]   Right?
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.440]   Because you're afraid
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.460]   that, that you experienced tsunami,
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.940]   so you don't go to the beach anymore.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.600]   But the thing is,
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.660]   the earth needs rain to live.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.860]   So he says,
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.100]   every time it rains,
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.040]   God's going to put a rainbow on there
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.780]   to remind you,
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.340]   right,
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:14.120]   that your confidence is not going to come
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.860]   because you're measuring the rain.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.120]   Your confidence comes because God said,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:18.820]   I will remember.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.180]   Right?
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:22.000]   That's what the,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.780]   that's what the rainbow was for,
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.520]   is to give us peace.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.720]   Right?
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:27.740]   And confidence,
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.120]   so that we can live
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.680]   based upon God's promise.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.600]   And then they turned it
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.420]   into what it is today.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.620]   So when you see a rainbow today,
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.760]   what does it remind you of?
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.780]   Obviously.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:38.640]   Right?
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:39.520]   Yeah,
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.340]   the gay community,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:40.620]   they,
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.800]   they perverted that.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.440]   Now,
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.420]   as sick as that is,
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:46.820]   that's basically,
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.940]   that's basically a sign of mankind.
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.900]   That every good gift
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:51.640]   that God has given,
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.580]   mankind spit,
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:53.300]   spit on it.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.860]   He didn't just disobey.
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.880]   Mankind turned it into something,
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.000]   right?
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:38:59.940]   So perverted.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.220]   Right?
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.440]   But it's not just a rainbow.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.640]   We pervert marriage.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   We pervert sex.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.780]   We pervert leadership.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.040]   Right?
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.520]   We pervert masculinity.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:10.980]   We pervert femininity.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.440]   We pervert work.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.600]   Every good thing God gives us
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.680]   to remind us of him,
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.020]   mankind not only rebels against it,
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:18.860]   but perverts it.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:19.700]   Right?
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:23.020]   There's other covenant symbols
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:23.740]   that God has given us.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.200]   Circumcision as a covenant symbol
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.240]   of Abraham and Israel.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.340]   Right?
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:29.620]   Every time that they circumsigned
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.200]   the child,
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.040]   it was an act of dedication
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.820]   that this child belongs to God,
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:34.600]   part of Israel.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.840]   The Sabbath,
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.220]   every time they observed Sabbath,
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.540]   was to get alongside them
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.220]   and to remember,
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:41.180]   remind themselves
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.360]   of the covenant relationship.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.680]   And the reason why
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.980]   they had to constantly
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:45.700]   remind themselves
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:46.700]   of the covenant relationship
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:47.880]   is because they were
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.840]   constantly living in danger.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.240]   Right?
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.780]   it was a reminder to them
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.760]   that God is with them.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.560]   And that's what the covenant symbol
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.020]   was for.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.780]   So we go to the New Testament.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.320]   Baptism is a covenant symbol
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.660]   of our union with Christ.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.800]   So when we get baptized,
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.100]   we are dead in Christ.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.520]   We arise with Christ.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.200]   And so everything that happens
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:08.860]   in life now
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:09.800]   is because we're united
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:10.440]   with Christ.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.260]   So if you are a child with God
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:14.540]   who is united with Christ,
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.080]   everything that happens to you
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.500]   happens in the context
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.780]   of Christ in the middle.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:21.880]   Right?
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.880]   So if you really think about
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.260]   what that covenant symbol
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:26.040]   is for a Christian,
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.400]   is that,
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.760]   and I mentioned,
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.980]   I don't know if I mentioned it here,
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.520]   but just like the disciples,
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.680]   when they're on that boat
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:33.920]   and they think it's going to sink.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.140]   Right?
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.020]   They think it's going to sink.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.120]   But Jesus is on that boat.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.780]   And so they say,
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.240]   we're going to die,
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:41.600]   we're going to die.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.280]   Jesus wakes up,
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.080]   remember what he says?
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.340]   You of little faith.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:45.440]   Right?
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.160]   Why are you afraid
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.120]   when I am with you?
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.400]   Right?
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.400]   So no matter what happens
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.020]   in this life,
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:52.300]   the covenant symbol
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.320]   that God has given us
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.400]   is a reminder to us
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.180]   that whatever happens
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:56.740]   in your life,
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:57.760]   Christ is in the middle.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.720]   So that covenant symbol
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.340]   is to give us peace,
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.280]   to remind us
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.160]   of God's promise.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.780]   It reveals God's nature
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.720]   and it gives us
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.620]   eternal security
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.580]   in Christ.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:13.200]   Right?
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.740]   So Hebrews 6, 17, 19,
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:16.400]   in the same way,
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.560]   God desiring even more
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.100]   to show
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:19.940]   to the heirs of the promise
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:20.940]   the unchangeableness
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:22.000]   of his purpose
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.120]   interposed with an oath
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.340]   so that by two
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.080]   unchangeable things
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.060]   in which it is impossible
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.140]   for God to lie,
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.460]   we who have taken refuge
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.560]   would have strong encouragement
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.240]   to take hold
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.500]   of the hope set before us.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.800]   This hope we have
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.860]   as an anchor of the soul,
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:36.240]   a hope both sure
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.000]   and steadfast
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.940]   and which enters
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.500]   within the veil.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.540]   So that's what
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:42.320]   the covenant symbol
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:42.820]   was for,
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.860]   is to fulfill this,
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.440]   Hebrews 6, 17, 19,
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.100]   so that we can live
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.800]   with confidence
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.120]   that what God promised
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.420]   he will do.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:53.460]   And that's why he says
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.220]   the word remember
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:54.940]   is so important.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.080]   If God said it,
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.260]   he will fulfill it
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.520]   and you can bank on it
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.500]   so that we can anchor
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.960]   our souls on this.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.900]   And the covenant symbol,
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.620]   symbols are to remind us
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.000]   of this.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.040]   What exactly was
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:11.540]   Ham's sin?
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:11.940]   And I'm,
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.880]   for the sake of time,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:13.280]   I'm not going to go
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.080]   too deep into it.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:14.640]   Basically,
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.760]   he covered his father's
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.260]   nakedness
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.120]   and dishonored him.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.760]   Now some have argued
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.040]   that Leviticus chapter 18
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:24.760]   talks about,
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.480]   you know,
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.640]   the uncovering
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.340]   his nakedness.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.840]   Is this possibly
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:29.420]   talking about
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:30.400]   some sexual act
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.560]   with his mom,
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.680]   right,
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.020]   or with Noah's husband?
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.400]   But the word for
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.980]   uncovered and saw here
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.500]   is different.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:38.980]   And if you look
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.700]   at the context,
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.640]   right,
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.220]   and I'm not going to go
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.100]   too deep into this.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.040]   if you look at the context
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.880]   of the brothers
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.800]   walking backward,
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.120]   right,
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.520]   to hide him
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.900]   and then him coming
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:50.700]   and telling him,
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.480]   telling the brothers
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.360]   about what he saw,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.040]   that it most likely
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:54.780]   isn't that
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:55.840]   if you somehow
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.440]   read that.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:56.980]   Okay.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.560]   I started this years ago
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.620]   and I forgot,
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.080]   but there is some,
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.560]   one of the views is that,
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.640]   but I don't think it is,
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.220]   so,
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.220]   and it is not a popular view.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.460]   Most people believe
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.060]   that it is not.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.640]   It's just what you see,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.480]   right?
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.600]   He saw his father's nakedness
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.080]   and instead of covering him up,
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.300]   he revealed his shame.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.960]   And that was the curse
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.060]   that led to his line
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:21.560]   being cursed,
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.260]   the Canaanites,
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:22.600]   right?
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.260]   And the next question is,
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.560]   why is Canaan mentioned
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.360]   instead of him?
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.580]   And I think one of the
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:29.500]   practical reasons why
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.660]   is because Moses is writing this
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.700]   right before he conquers Canaan.
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.360]   Right?
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.380]   So this is justification
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:37.360]   of what's happening.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.860]   Right?
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:41.460]   Now,
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.560]   I'm going to,
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.440]   this is going to come
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.140]   with the question,
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.460]   your discussion question,
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.760]   because honoring your father
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.220]   and mother
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.840]   is huge in the Bible.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:53.880]   If a child rebels
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.600]   against the parents,
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.180]   what happens?
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.200]   in the Old Covenant,
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.360]   was it a covenant?
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.300]   He gets stoned to them.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.940]   There was no tolerance
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:01.940]   for teenage rebellion.
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.440]   Right?
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.060]   In our generation,
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:05.700]   it's almost like,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:05.840]   oh,
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.400]   it's a teenager.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.200]   Oh,
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:07.780]   they have,
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:08.840]   that's what they do.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.900]   It's because we've accepted it.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.760]   Right?
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.280]   And it's part of the fall.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.740]   But he said,
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.200]   the Bible tells us
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.180]   it's that dangerous.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:17.800]   When you,
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.200]   when you see children
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.560]   rebelling against their parents,
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.080]   something has seriously
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:22.580]   gone wrong
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:24.200]   because the order
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.120]   that God has created,
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.340]   if a child
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.900]   rebels against parents,
[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.060]   right,
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.780]   then he's going to have
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.220]   no problem
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.280]   rebelling against God.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.600]   Right?
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:33.940]   And they said,
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.100]   if you want to live long
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.660]   and prosper in the land,
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.020]   he says,
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.100]   honor your father and mother.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:38.500]   In other words,
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.420]   if you want to live,
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.680]   just honor your father and mother.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.620]   especially in the Western culture,
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.140]   that rebellion against parents
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.500]   is almost accepted.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.520]   It's one of those,
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.280]   you know,
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:52.820]   reasonable sins
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.780]   that you should not make it,
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.960]   because every kid does that.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.620]   Right?
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.320]   I'm not saying we need to stone them,
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.720]   but we need to take that sin seriously.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:01.540]   Right?
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.180]   Because a child,
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:04.880]   a rebellious child,
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.460]   should not be something
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.780]   that we just think is acceptable
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:10.220]   because the world says it's okay.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.800]   Because the Bible
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.120]   puts a very high standard of that.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.140]   Right?
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:17.100]   You cannot have a child
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:18.380]   rebelling against parents
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.520]   be obedient to God.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.400]   Okay?
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.100]   All right.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.520]   So next week,
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.580]   we have one more session.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.660]   So let's go out with a bang.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:29.780]   Okay?
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.640]   Chapter 10 and 11.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.180]   What words or phrases are repeated
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.380]   of the list of descendants?
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.840]   I'm not going to cover,
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.080]   say,
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:38.740]   who are the descendants?
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:39.780]   Shem, Ham, and Japheth,
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.960]   because that's going to come next week.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.240]   What are some names
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.720]   that are highlighted in the genealogy?
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.260]   Okay?
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:45.320]   So pay attention.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.340]   When it's going quick,
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.240]   which names do you notice
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.380]   and why are they highlighted?
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.660]   Try to identify geographical areas
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.260]   if they mention any of that.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.260]   Identify any patterns
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:00.500]   in the genealogy.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.740]   And then what was the stated goal
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:02.620]   of building the city
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.540]   and the tower in 11.4?
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:06.560]   And why did this incur God's judgment
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.040]   on them?
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:07.700]   Okay?
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.780]   And then, again,
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.240]   take some time to review
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.020]   chapter 1 through 11.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.880]   Even though we have to cover
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.540]   two chapters,
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.720]   I'm going to at least try
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.200]   to review 1 through 11
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.020]   just to kind of see,
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:19.820]   make sure that you guys
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:20.340]   have this memorized.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.640]   So when you come back next week,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.260]   that's going to be one of the first things
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.180]   I'm going to ask you to do
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:25.260]   in your small group
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.620]   to try to recite
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:27.700]   chapters 1 through 11
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:28.420]   just generally
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.840]   that at least you know the flow.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.260]   Okay?
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.520]   And then here are the four
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.780]   discussion questions for today.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.400]   What way are you being fruitful
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:35.080]   and multiplying?
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.220]   What is a promise
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.580]   that God has made
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.400]   that you cling to
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:40.180]   for daily life
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:40.920]   and what promise
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.320]   do you struggle to believe
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:42.820]   and practice
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:43.680]   in your walk with God?
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:44.100]   Okay?
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.420]   Why is honoring a parent
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.940]   so crucial to human survival?
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:48.500]   I.e.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:49.780]   5th of the 10th generation,
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:50.780]   10th commandment
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.720]   and repeated in
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.760]   Ephesians 6.2.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.500]   And there's other places
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.420]   but those are the only two
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:55.420]   things that I mentioned.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.660]   And then what covenant
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.380]   are you in
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.660]   and how faithful do you think
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:46:59.960]   you are to these covenants?
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.100]   What are the covenants
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:02.740]   that we're in?
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:06.680]   We have a covenant
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.240]   with God
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.380]   like unilateral covenant
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:09.280]   that God has given us.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.660]   Those of you who are married
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.460]   are in a marriage covenant
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:13.460]   that you made.
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.840]   You are a covenant
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.160]   at Bering Community Church.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.400]   You're part of this church.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.240]   Right?
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.360]   Any family that you belong to
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.860]   there is a covenant in there.
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:23.940]   You don't have to sign
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.340]   a covenant
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:25.140]   to be in a covenant.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.740]   There's a tie in there.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.240]   Right?
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.920]   That's universally accepted.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.360]   So can you name
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.440]   any other covenants
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.260]   that you can think of?
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:33.860]   Right?
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.240]   You don't have to say
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.700]   I am part of this covenant.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.600]   There are covenant
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.780]   things that naturally exist
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.900]   right?
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.440]   In life.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.160]   And so
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.620]   see if you can identify
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.140]   any more
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:45.540]   but those are the obvious ones
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.300]   and
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.820]   in those covenants
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.020]   are you being faithful to it?
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:49.440]   Okay?
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.220]   And that's the question.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:50.600]   Right?
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.480]   let me pray for us
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.320]   and give you time
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.220]   to discuss.
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:57.420]   Father we thank you
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:58.300]   for your living word.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.900]   We pray that
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.960]   as we have this time
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.920]   in our small groups
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.420]   that these discussions
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:04.960]   Lord God
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.040]   would not simply be to
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.260]   understand
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.400]   and head knowledge
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.920]   but I pray that
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:10.940]   it would truly search
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:12.540]   and judge the thoughts
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.040]   and intentions
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:13.640]   of our heart.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.980]   Help us Lord God
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:16.040]   individually
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:16.900]   and collectively
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:18.760]   that we would pursue you
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:19.720]   with all our hearts Lord
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.060]   and teach us what it means
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:21.760]   to worship you
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.620]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.760]   In Jesus name we pray.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.420]   Amen.
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.420]   Amen.
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:27.420]   Amen.
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.420]   Amen.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   Amen.
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.420]   Amen.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.420]   Amen.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.420]   Amen.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.420]   Amen.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.420]   Amen.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   Amen.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.420]   Amen.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.200]   Thank you.
