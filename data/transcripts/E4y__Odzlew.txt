[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.420]   And sings the song of righteousness
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.000]   By blood and not by merit
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:11.880]   Your grace that reaches far and wide
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.660]   To every tribe and nation
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.440]   Has called my heart to enter in
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.040]   The joy of your salvation

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.480]   The prince of life without a stain
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.720]   Was traded for this sinner
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.960]   By grace I am restored

[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.700]   For you on the app on the website and on our social media pages
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.720]   So just kind of keep an eye out for it
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.480]   It should go up by later on today
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.640]   And on Friday we will be doing Good Friday communion
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.740]   We'll have an overflow room over there in the cafe
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.980]   And for families the overflow room will be in the youth chapel
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.800]   And so if you are doing
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.200]   If you are going to be taking communion in the youth chapel
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.420]   You're going to have to make your way over to the cafe
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.640]   As the elements will be provided over there
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.080]   If you have any other questions
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.280]   Please just make sure to speak to the logistics team
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.460]   There's going to be a table out there at the end
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.640]   And they have a lot of answers
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.520]   Secondly there's cleaning and maintenance day
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.940]   That's going to be on April 26th
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.240]   We're told that we need about 70 more people to sign up
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   Which is quite a bit
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.520]   So if you can come and help us to clean
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.000]   To fix things around the church
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.240]   It is a lot of fun
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.580]   So please sign up for that
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.940]   The table in the courtyard
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.280]   There will be a sign up there
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.740]   Next we have a Berean service auction
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.640]   For those who would like to put up a service for the auction
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.220]   All proceeds go to our missions fund
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.340]   And that's going to be ending this coming weekend
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.040]   And so please make sure if you are planning on doing it
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.940]   Get it done in the next few days or so
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.400]   To make sure to get those in
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.540]   And then our VBS is on June 23rd to the 27th
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.340]   A reminder that students must be children of Berean members
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.680]   Or prospective members only
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.340]   So sign up for that
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.460]   There will be another sign up for that outside
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.680]   Lastly, our all church retreat is going to be on August 1st
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.200]   To August 3rd in Palm Desert
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.320]   The early registration is now open
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   So if you don't want to pay an extra $30
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.380]   Go ahead and sign up as fast as you possibly can
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.440]   The registration page
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   It's going to give you all the pricing
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.060]   And instructions on what to do
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.440]   The table outside, again
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.940]   It's going to have everything you need there
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.320]   In terms of information and also the sign ups
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.920]   So basically if you didn't understand anything I said
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.800]   Just go out to the table
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.060]   And they'll tell you what to do, okay
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.200]   We have an offering basket in the back
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.340]   You can give it electronically
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.980]   But let's bow our heads in prayer
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.580]   To pray for the offering together
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:54.540]   Oh God, I pray that as we celebrate the Passion Week
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.400]   That our hearts would be worshipful
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.160]   God, as we give our offering to you
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.000]   Lord, we know that you desire our very hearts
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.920]   And so I pray for genuine and true worship
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.900]   To emanate from us
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.920]   God, that it would come as we see you as you are
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.300]   God, that we would be worshipers
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.600]   Glorifiers of the one true God
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.800]   And Lord, that it would be a glad response
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.740]   That we surrender the entirety of our lives to you
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.740]   And our desire, God, is for your kingdom to come
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:36.500]   God, that it would be a prayer for you
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.580]   God, that it would come as you are
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.480]   God, that it would come as you are

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:09.540]   Let us all rise and spend a few
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.660]   moments to greet the neighbors
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.500]   around us
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   God, that it would come as you are

[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   the mountain which is east of the
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   city and that's talking about that
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   Mount of Olives
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   that when Israel had been faithless
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   and faithless and faithless time
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   and time again God had used
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   foreign nations, foreign
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   occupation to bring about his
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   judgment and wrath upon his very
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   own people and he made it very
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.500]   clear that it was by his hand that
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   these foreign nations would be
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   coming but he says that one day he
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   will come back and he leaves in
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   this very same place that he says
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   he'll return but it's because of
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   their faithlessness it continues
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   then I told the exiles all the
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   things that the Lord had shown me
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   then the word of the Lord came to
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   me saying son of man you live in
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   the midst of the rebellious house
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   who have eyes to see but do not
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   see ears to hear but do not hear for
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   they are a rebellious house therefore
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   son of man prepare for yourself
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.500]   baggage for exile and go into
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   exile by a day in their sight even
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   go into exile from your place to
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   another place in their sight perhaps
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   they will understand though they are
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   a rebellious house and he's talking
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   and he's talking to his own people
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500]   he's saying seeing they don't see
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   hearing they don't hear and that this
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   is why God's glory left them this is
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   why they were left under foreign
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   occupation and so as these exiled
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   Israelites and Ezekiel await a
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   Messiah king to come and ultimately
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   to rescue them it's going to be at the
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   Mount of Olives in which they're
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   expecting this Messiah to come from this
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.500]   this is very very exciting think about
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   it put yourself in the shoes and in
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   the position of these Israelites it's
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   very exciting because the disciples are
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   seeing all the signs they're seeing all
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   the prophecies and these things are
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   flashing before their eyes it's what
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   causes Peter to correctly identify
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   Jesus as the Christ the son of the
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   living God and though we we see it you
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   we see it you know it's it's very wrong
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   the way it came about but James and
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   John's mother it's the reason why she
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   said please let my sons be on the left
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   and right of Jesus when in the kingdom
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.500]   when the kingdom comes and so the time
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   feels right they're all feeling and all
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   the disciples are feeling this the
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   climax coming here everything has been
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   culminating to this point that we're
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   reading in Matthew chapter 21 and this
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   is the very area Mount of Olives where
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   Jesus directs the two disciples to go
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   in find a donkey colt with his mother and
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   this kicks off two prophecies and we're
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.500]   mainly going to look at these two
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   prophecies today the first prophecy is
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   from Zechariah chapter 9 and it's
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   speaking of a king who comes and
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.500]   strangely enough gentle and humble the
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   king the Messiah coming in to conquer
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   what was what was understood but
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   right in the middle of Zechariah you're
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   going to see this idea of him coming
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   humble and gentle so we see it in
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   Matthew 21 verse 4 this took place to
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   fulfill what was spoken through the
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   prophet say to the daughter of Zion
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   behold your king is coming to you gentle
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   and mounted on a donkey even on a colt
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   the foal of a beast of burden and so
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   now to direct your attention to
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   Zechariah this prophecy in Matthew is
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   very very well understood this was a
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   popular messianic prophecy from
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   Zechariah and Zechariah was a prophet
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   who came after the Israelites returned
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   from exile to Babylon but they were
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   still under foreign occupation and so
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   and so the Israelites were still waiting
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   for salvation they were still waiting
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   for a Messiah and they believe that God
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   had left them because of their
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   faithlessness and they would have been
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   correct in that belief now this
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   prophecy comes from Matthew a
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.500]   Zechariah chapter 9 right before
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   Zechariah chapter 9 we have Zechariah
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   chapter 8 here's what it says in verse
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500]   verse 13 thus says the Lord I will
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   return to Zion and will dwell in the
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   midst of Jerusalem thus says the Lord
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   of hosts behold I am going to save my
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   people from the land of the east and
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   from the land of the west and I will
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   bring them back and they will live in
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   the midst of Jerusalem and they shall
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   be my people and I will be their God
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   and truth and righteousness so this
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   makes complete sense to them this
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   falls right in line with what they're
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   thinking that the Messiah is going to
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   come and deliver them and there's a
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   lot more language that I didn't I
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   didn't put all the text here there's a
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   lot of language of God's wrath that's
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   coming his judgment that is going to
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   come and he is going to save his people
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   from them and it's here that the Lord
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   where it says that he will he will he
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   will come in in a wrath that that
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.500]   can't even be understood the very
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.500]   last chapter of Zechariah Zechariah
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   chapter 14 it says this then the Lord
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   will go forth and fight against those
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.500]   nations as when he fights on a day of
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   battle in that day his feet will stand
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   and here it is his feet will stand on
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   the Mount of Olives which is in front
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500]   of Jerusalem on the east and the
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.500]   Mount of Olives will be split in its
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   middle from east to west by a very
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   large valley so that half of the
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.500]   mountain will move toward the north and
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   the other half toward the south then
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   the Lord my God will come and all the
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   and all the holy ones with him so so
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   when Matthew conjures up this this
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   Zechariah 9 passage Zechariah was a
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   very understood prophet and they'd be
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   thinking of all of this that God is
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.500]   going to come to save us from foreign
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   occupation this is the mindset the
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   Israelites were in as they were waiting
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   for the Messiah and here they were in
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.500]   in Matthew 21 at the foot of the very
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.500]   mountain everything culminating
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   everything exciting building up but
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.500]   the passage Matthew uses is Zechariah
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   9 9 and he says in Zechariah 9 9 rejoice
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.500]   greatly O daughter of Zion shout and
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   triumph O daughter of Jerusalem behold your
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   king is coming to you great right and
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.500]   and then the twist the mystery where he
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.500]   says he is just and endowed with
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.500]   salvation humble and mounted on a
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   donkey and he says I will cut off the
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   chariot from Ephraim and the horse from
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.500]   Jerusalem and the bow of war will be
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   cut off and he will speak peace to the
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   nations like what you're supposed to
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   bring judgment on the nations it says
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.500]   he will speak peace to the nations and
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   his dominion will be from sea to sea how
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.500]   do those two things jive peace to the
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   nations but dominion from sea to sea and
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.500]   from the river to the ends of the earth
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500]   now this is unexpected this is very
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   mysterious because the king is coming
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   to defeat the nations but he is coming
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.500]   as a gentle humble king mounted on the
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   colt of a donkey specifically a donkey
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   perhaps raised for labor remember who
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   we're talking about we're talking about
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.500]   sovereign God remember how God saves
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   remember his power what they would have
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   understood was that this is the God who
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   with the ten plagues were able to conquer
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   all of Egypt who before Sennacherib and the
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   Syrians wiped out an entire army with one
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   blow who confused all of mankind in a
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.500]   battle in the tower of Babel who is able
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   to make a worldwide flub come and wipe
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   out all of humanity the one who can make
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   the earth open up and swallow the
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.500]   rebellious the one who creates the word
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   with his the world with the with the word
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   of his power Zechariah prophesies that
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:21.500]   the Lord is going to come humble that's
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   very very this I don't know what the word
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   to use it's it's it doesn't fit he would
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.500]   not come as a warrior on a war horse he's
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   he's going to come in on a donkey how
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   does this make sense if you look
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   carefully at this prophecy you'll see
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   in verse 10 there that the Lord will
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.500]   indeed cut off the chariot the horse the
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   bow from all the nations he's going to
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500]   conquer and he's going to bring peace
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   not just to Jerusalem but what does he
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.500]   say to the whole world that was always
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.500]   his purpose even for the Israelites what
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   they understood was that he was going to
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.500]   he was going to choose the nation of
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   Israel but for them to what to bring
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.500]   blessing to the nations that was the
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   whole point so why is this conquering
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.500]   going to be done in humility because
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   this is the only way that God can
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.500]   accomplish the salvation of the world to
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   to save the world so God did not come to
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   defeat men but he came to save men his
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.500]   point even in raising up of Israel was to
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   bring blessing to bring salvation to the
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500]   ends of the earth and all of this for a
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   singular end to bring glory to himself so
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   that all might know him if we're
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.500]   believers all the worship and glory that
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   comes up out of us is heightened by the
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   fact that he saved us the Israelites were
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   awaiting a king who would come and destroy
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.500]   all their enemies but this is not what God
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   came for the Messiah king they received is
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   from John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   that he gave his only begotten son that
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500]   whoever believes in him shall not perish but
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   have eternal life for God did not send the
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   son into the world to judge the world but
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.500]   that the world might be saved through him so
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.500]   the Messiah king was going to come in
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.500]   humility on a meek beast of burden and
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   this was clearly stated for the to the
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.500]   Israelites for all of these years but
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.500]   they weren't able to comprehend what it
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   meant even though Jesus was trying to
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.500]   tell his disciples all this time that
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   what he came to accomplish so here
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   comes this Jesus on this colt from the
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   Mount of Olives the Messiah king the
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   excitement continuing to increase in
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.500]   his disciples can you imagine their
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   hearts this is it and they see these
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   unfurling of prophecies and it moves us
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   into the second prophecy stated in the
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.500]   Psalm Psalm 118 prophecy and it shows us
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   a king who comes to save chapter 21 verse
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   6 through 9 their narrative states the
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   disciples went and did just as Jesus
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.500]   had instructed them and brought the
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.500]   donkey and the colt and laid their coats
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.500]   on them and sat on the coats and he sat
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.500]   on the coats most of the crowd spread
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   their coats in the road and others were
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.500]   cutting branches from the trees spreading
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   them in the road the crowds going ahead of
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.500]   him and those who followed were shouting
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   shouting Hosanna to the son of David blessed
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   Hosanna in the highest you can see the
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.500]   culminating excitement not only in the
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   disciples but now the disciples are
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.500]   beginning to see that the exact thing
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   that they were seeing the crowds were
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.500]   seeing remember what time of year this
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   was this was the Passover remember what
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   the Passover was when God came in and
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.500]   saved them from the Egyptians from
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.500]   foreign occupation the crowd is in a
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   frenzy right now they're throwing their
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   coats on the road they're cutting off palm
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   palm branches they're worshiping at the
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   top of their lungs shouting this
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   interesting phrase Hosanna to the son of
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   David before we get into the psalm a
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.500]   really interesting note in first Kings
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   first Kings is a time before King David
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.500]   dies and they're about to coronate
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   Solomon literally the son of David as
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.500]   king and this is what it says this is
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   King David King David said to them take
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   with you the servants of your Lord and
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   have my son of Solomon ride on my own
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   mule and bring him down to Gihon
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   all of it by the way and this is
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   interesting because this is how Solomon
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   is introduced to the Israelites as the
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   next king as the next king as David is
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   about to die he comes riding in on this
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   mule to a crowd that was hailing him as
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   king in fact the first Kings 1 40 we
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.500]   don't I don't have that one for you
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   here but he kept reading it says the
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   earth was shaking at their noise and
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   Solomon's first acts you read chapter 2
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.500]   you read chapter 3 Solomon's first act
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   is to clean house pronouncing the
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.500]   judgment of death on those servants who
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   are unfaithful and then he builds the
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   temple of God right where Jerusalem
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   stood and that sounds pretty familiar
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   and will continue to sound familiar this
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.500]   week and so there is prophecy being
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   fulfilled here and we have here in
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   Matthew the people beginning to shout
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   this phrase Hosanna to the son of
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   David blessed is he who comes in the
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   name of the Lord and here he comes
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   much no not marching here that he's
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   on the top of the donkey this is from
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   Psalm chapter 118 that phrase Hosanna
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   Psalm chapter 118 Psalm 118 what you
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   need to know about that is it's the
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   last song in a collection of six songs
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.500]   chapter 113 to chapter 118 is a
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.500]   collection of songs and that collection
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   of songs they saying you know when
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.500]   every Passover so it was on their
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   minds and they sing it during Passover
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.500]   because Hosanna makes sense when
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   you're thinking back to Passover and
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.500]   Hosanna made sense because they were
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.500]   still waiting for a Messiah and the
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   Messiah had entered in and the
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   crowds were rocking the ground of
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.500]   Jerusalem here's what it says in Psalm
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   118 10 all nations surrounded me in
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   the name of the Lord I will surely
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   cut them off they surrounded me yes
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500]   they surrounded me in the name of the
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.500]   Lord I will surely cut them off they
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   surrounded me like bees they were
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   extinguished as a fire of thorns in
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.500]   the name of the Lord I will surely
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.500]   cut them off cut them off by the way
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.500]   is so important to understand about
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.500]   Jesus's crucifixion you push me
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.500]   violently so that I was falling but
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   the Lord helped me the Lord is my
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.500]   strength and song he has become my
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   salvation and so here you see shades
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   of Zechariah that the expectation was
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500]   for the Lord to come and rescue them
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   from foreign powers and establish his
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.500]   people it further emphasizes what the
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.500]   Israelites were expecting but similar
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   to Zechariah look what's nestled in
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.500]   nestled in there Psalm chapter 118 verse
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:51.500]   22 just incredible the stone which the
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   builders rejected has become the chief
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:58.500]   cornerstone that's incredible that
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.500]   that's in there oh Lord do save that's
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.500]   Hosanna we beseech you oh Lord we beseech
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   you do send prosperity blessed is the one
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   who comes in the name of the Lord we have
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   we have blessed you from the house of the
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.500]   Lord where Zechariah surprisingly
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.500]   talks about the Messiah being a gentle
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.500]   meek king coming in on a donkey here
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   there's something even more startling the
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.500]   stone which the builders rejected has
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.500]   become the chief cornerstone that is that
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.500]   the very people who are awaiting Christ are
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   are going to be the very people who will
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   reject the Christ they were singing that
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   song where Zechariah surprisingly talks
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.500]   about this gentle Messiah we see it this
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.500]   even more startling truth that the
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.500]   prophecy is stating that he'd be rejected
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.500]   and there and then as we look at this
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   this passage in Matthew if you were to
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   keep going it just the startling nature
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.500]   of it just keeps rocking you in fact the
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.500]   parable that he speaks right after the
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.500]   triumphal entry is the one with the
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.500]   landowner if you're if you're familiar
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.500]   with this parable it's the one with the
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   landowner and basically he gives a
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   vineyard and rents it out to these
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   farmers before he leaves on a journey and
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   and when harvest time comes he sends his
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   servants to go and collect his share but
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   the tenants what do they do many of us
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   are familiar with this they will beat
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   some and they killed others right and
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.500]   those were supposed to represent the
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   prophets that were pointing right and
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   then what does he do at the end he
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.500]   sends his son his very own son it's
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.500]   almost absurd like they're killing your
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.500]   servants why would you send your son
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.500]   but it says perhaps they'll listen to
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.500]   him but the tenants they kill the son
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.500]   and Jesus ends by asking what is the
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   owner going to do and the listeners do
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.500]   that the owners would punish the
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.500]   tenants and what give the vineyard to
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   others who would receive if you read
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.500]   like what emanates out of that parable
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.500]   it's in Matthew 21 for 42
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   Jesus said to them do you did you never
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   read in the scriptures the stone which
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.500]   the builders rejected this became the
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   chief cornerstone this came about from
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.500]   the Lord and it is marvelous in our
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.500]   eyes therefore I say to you the kingdom
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.500]   of God will be taken away from you and
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   given to a people producing the fruit
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.500]   the fruit of it now imagine the
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.500]   Israelites as they're listening to
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.500]   Jews as they're listening to this they
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   know Psalm 118 they know what he's
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500]   quoting there they just saying
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.500]   Hosanna and he comes and sings and
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.500]   says this parable to them he says he
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.500]   who falls on the stone will be broken
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.500]   to pieces but on whomever it falls it
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   will scatter him like dust when the
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.500]   chief priests and the Pharisees heard
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.500]   his parables they understood that he
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.500]   was speaking about them when they
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   sought to seize him they feared the
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.500]   people because they considered him to be
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:09.500]   be a prophet in the middle of their
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   singing their glory to God they
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500]   didn't realize that these prophecies
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.500]   were coming to light right before
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.500]   their eyes that the Messiah that had
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.500]   been talked about the son of David the
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.500]   humble and gentle king returning on a
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.500]   a cult would come to a city that
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   would sing his praises and then
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   and then crucify him he came to save the
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:39.500]   very people who would kill him they
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.500]   thought that God's wrath was for the
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   foreign nations but God's wrath is on
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.500]   much more than that God's wrath is on
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   all unrighteousness it's on sin it's on
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   wickedness God did not come to give
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   these Israelites what they were
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.500]   demanding that what they wanted was to
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.500]   be out of foreign occupation to be given
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   their own land to be given their own
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.500]   riches to be given their own own own
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.500]   legend they wanted to have a place for
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   their families they wanted to live their
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.500]   lives and so they were saying praise
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.500]   God because we can worship a God like
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   that and when he became not the the
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   Messiah that they were expecting they
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   instead of just rejecting they killed
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.500]   him because that is the end of
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.500]   wickedness that is the end of sin that
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:41.500]   is the end of evil God's wrath is on
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.500]   much more than foreign occupation they
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.500]   they didn't realize that they needed to
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.500]   be saved from their very own sin and
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.500]   that the salvation would have to be
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.500]   from the very hand of God himself they
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:59.500]   were the enemies of God they had no
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.500]   idea what they were singing when they
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:08.500]   were saying Hosanna save us Matthew
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.500]   Matthew 21:10 it concludes when he had
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   entered Jerusalem all the city was
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.500]   stirred and that word isn't strong
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.500]   enough it's the word riotous saying
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.500]   who is this and the crowds were saying
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.500]   this is a prophet Jesus from Nazareth in
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   Galilee and so the passage here
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   concludes with them asking this
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   question who is this of course they
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   know who he is Jesus from Nazareth
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.500]   everyone's heard about him they're
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   trying to core make him king but we
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   but we know that they didn't know him
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   but we know Jesus in Hebrews chapter
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.500]   1 verse 1 through 2 it says God after
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.500]   he spoke long ago to the fathers and
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   the prophets in many portions and in
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.500]   many ways in these last days has
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:54.500]   spoken to us in his son that God has
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   sent prophet after prophet Zechariah
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   after psalmist to tell who Jesus was
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.500]   that this is what the Messiah is going
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.500]   to look like that he is going to come
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.500]   as a conquering king but he will be
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:12.500]   humble and he will be rejected but in
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.500]   these last days this is the culmination
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   of it no more prophets he will speak
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.500]   through his very own son that's what
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   that's what passion week is about he
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   came to preach his life becoming the
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.500]   words of the gospel themselves God has
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   been speaking to his people all through
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.500]   this time it was their sin that caused
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   that veil to be over their eyes they
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   thought that they'd be safe from
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500]   earthly conquerors to be given earthly
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.500]   prosperity but they did not see that
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   their true enslavement was not to
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   men but to their own sin and that's
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   why testimony after testimony person
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500]   going under water after going
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500]   under water gives a testimony that
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.500]   says that I was not saved from my
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   depression or my loneliness or
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   something like that that I was not
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.500]   saved from from a bad life and now I
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   have a good life I was saved from my
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:11.500]   sin they didn't see that prosperity
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.500]   wasn't in the things of this world they
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   didn't listen generation after
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   generation after generation God
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.500]   speaking to them miracle after
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.500]   miracle prophecy after prophecy trying
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   to get your attention paying the
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   just the painful way in which is
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   long-standing patience and grace and
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.500]   compassion just just just over and
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   over and over again Jesus should
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   have coming in just ridden in on a
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:44.500]   war horse pronouncing judgment destroying
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.500]   destroying the sinful he should have
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.500]   destroyed yes yes he should have
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.500]   destroyed the Egyptians and the
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   Philistines and the Greeks and the
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500]   Romans the Babylonians and the
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.500]   Assyrians he should have destroyed
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.500]   them all but he should have also
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.500]   destroyed all of the Jews perhaps
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.500]   there's even more than more
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.500]   responsibility they were given the
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   promises the law they were given the
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   prophet after prophet he should have
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.500]   come and destroyed them all and he
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.500]   doesn't it doesn't end there he
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.500]   should he should this have come in
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.500]   destroying everyone the America
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.500]   should be destroyed Canada Mexico
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   Russia and Ukraine should be
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   destroyed Russia not only Russia but
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   China North Korea South Korea
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   everywhere destroyed destruction in one
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   terrifying swoop he should have come in
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   to bring peace and justice into this
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.500]   land to get rid of the very problem
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:51.500]   itself us but he doesn't do that
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   do that
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   Palm Sunday is wild he doesn't do that he
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   doesn't say that
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.500]   word and the word was with God and the
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   word was God and the word became flesh
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.500]   and dwelt among us and we saw his
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:15.500]   glory glory as of the only begotten from
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.500]   the father full of grace and truth he
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   came to preach the gospel so he did not
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   come in on a war horse he came in on a
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:31.500]   donkey God's words were falling on deaf
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:36.500]   ears and so he came inexplicably yet
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   yet again the clearest way he sent sent
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   servant after servant prophet after
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   prophet and his people beat and killed
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   them and he still sent his son God's
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.500]   love is like this and this is what we're
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.500]   going to see night after night this week
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   and then we're going to wake up very
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   early next week and be a little angry
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   because it's early and then we're going
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   to come here and we are going to marvel
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   together and worship together and
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.500]   glorify God together because everything
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   that we know is being seen on this week
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   is about how he came and saved us because
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   he loved us
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:24.500]   this week is when the son of man marches
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.500]   day by day step by step to save the
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   people from sin
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:30.500]   John 13:1 just just pulls it together so
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   nicely now before the feast of the
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   Passover Jesus knowing that his hour had
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   come that he would depart out of this
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.500]   world to the father having loved his
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   own who were in the world he loved them
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   to the end he didn't sit there and say
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   well I tried you know God should have
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   done that God should have done that
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   faithlessness after faithlessness I
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   tried and who can fault God he went
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   way above and beyond it makes no sense
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   it's incomprehensible that he did it
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   again and again and again and again we
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   should have stopped you know well to the
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   judges
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   but he didn't say well I tried he
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500]   didn't say they didn't listen it says
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.500]   in John that he he loved them to the
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.500]   bitter end
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.500]   every drop of the cup of God's wrath that
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   ought to have been poured out upon the
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   nations poured out upon the sinner he
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   loved them to the bitter end God loved
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   us while we were enemies God loved us
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   while we were sinners as the
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   Israelites were mistaken that they
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   thought it was outside of them the
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.500]   salvation that needed to come we have
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   we have to be careful in our knowing
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   of who God has come against do you
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500]   remember when Jesus approaches Samaria
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   and Luke chapter 9 verse 54 it says
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   when his disciples James and John saw
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   this this is Samaria they said Lord do
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   you want us to command fire to come
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   down from heaven and consume them but
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   Jesus turned and rebuked them and said
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   you do not know what kind of spirit you
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   are of for the son of man did not come
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   to destroy men's lives but to save
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   them just incredible isn't it this is
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   the king that came into the world this
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   is what the king is like this is what
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   God is like he desires for none to
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500]   perish and for all to come to
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500]   repentance this is what we'll be seeing
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   this is what we'll be seeing in this
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.500]   passion week we can marvel at this that
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   he is slow to anger and abounding in
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.500]   steadfast love to the unlovable to the
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.500]   enemy to the wicked to the vile everything
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500]   if we could bottle up passion week and
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   everything that Jesus went through all
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   the mocking all the scorn all the
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.500]   shame all the sin bottle bottle it all
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:07.500]   up that still Jesus came to forgive us of
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   all of it there's need for each of us to
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500]   consider our own sin that before we look
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   out we must allow the word of God to
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500]   look into us that before we point the
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500]   fingers towards others we must see where
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.500]   we ourselves are there are two paths to
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500]   take one which repents and surrenders
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500]   before the king of kings the other
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.500]   rebels and so we have to be careful
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   because we might say that these are them
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500]   the Israelites but we know how much our
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500]   how much our hearts mimic how much our
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500]   hearts are reflected in these
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   Israelites this week we have to do a lot
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.500]   of self-reflection because it is when we
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500]   remember a new a fresh that he came to
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   save me from my sin that is the only way
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   we are going to be able to go out into
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   the world and properly deliver the good
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.500]   news of Jesus Christ there's no other
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   way what are we going to say oh you
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   wicked people he came to save you there's
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   there's no way we can do that we come
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   humble to the church for the believer
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   have you forgotten him do you find
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500]   yourself in a position of the people at
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   the end saying who is this Jesus have
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   you forgotten his abounding love do you
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   remember him or have you forgotten if
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   if we know him and remember him then we
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500]   will eagerly await for him to come
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   back longing for the kingdom not
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   investing in a lot not longing in the
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   things of this fading world our love
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500]   will be for him and not for this world
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   and so we will go out into the world and
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500]   evangelize we will become the very body
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   of Christ that shares this gospel
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500]   message because why did Jesus come
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.500]   into the world for this and so why am
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   I still in the world as the body of
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.500]   Christ for this because he does not
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   desire for any to come to death but for
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   all to come to repentance and so that's
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.500]   why church we live our lives we remember
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:25.500]   it again this week what he did but to
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   wrap this up don't be mistaken he's
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500]   going to completely fulfill the rest of
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.500]   what was written in Zechariah and
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500]   psalm and all the prophecies of the
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.500]   conquering king Jesus is indeed coming
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   he came to conquer sin but he is coming
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   back to claim his people none of his
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   promises are going to fail the
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   fullness of the prophecies will come
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500]   to pass one day when Jesus returns for
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   his own in fact remember when we're in
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.500]   we're in Matthew 21 tonight today in
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.500]   just three chapters is to all of it
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500]   discourse that's the one where he
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]   shows you what it's going to look
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   like when he comes back and he says in
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   Matthew 24 29 but immediately after the
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500]   tribulation of those days the sun will
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   be darkened and the moon will not give
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500]   its light and the stars will fall from
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   the sky and the powers of the heavens
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500]   will be shaken and then the sun the
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.500]   sign of the son of man will appear in
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.500]   the sky and then all the tribes of the
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   earth what does it say it says they
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   will mourn and they will see the son of
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.500]   man coming on the clouds of the sky with
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   power and great glory and he will send
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   forth his angels with a great trumpet and
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500]   they will gather together his elect from
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500]   the four winds from one end of the sky
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.500]   to the other Jesus is going to come
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   back like this you want to see how he's
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   going to come back and this is how we'll
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500]   conclude Revelation 19 let's look at
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.500]   Revelation 19 remember the first time he
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   came in on a donkey but this is how he
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.500]   will return Revelation 19 11 and I saw
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   heaven opened and behold a white horse
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:04.500]   and he who sat on it is called faithful
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.500]   and true and in righteousness he judges
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:14.500]   judges and wages war his eyes are a flame of
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.500]   fire and on his head are many diadems and
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.500]   he has a name written on him which no one
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500]   knows except himself he is clothed with the
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.500]   robe dipped in blood and his name is called
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.500]   the word of God and the armies which are
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.500]   in heaven clothed and fine linen white and
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   clean were following him themselves on white
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   horses from his mouth comes a sharp sword so
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   that with it he may strike down the nations
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.500]   and he will rule them with the rod of
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   iron and he treads the winepress of the
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   fierce wrath of God the Almighty and on his
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   robe and on his thigh he has a name written
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   King of Kings and Lord of Lords when we go
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   and evangelize we preach two things we
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.500]   we preach grace and we preach judgment right
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   we go out and we tell everybody of the Jesus
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   who came what he did what he's like how much
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:18.500]   he loves how he so desires but we also point
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   forward and we plead with them kneel confess
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   confess confess repent as he is coming back
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   like this so in the triumphal entry so
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   strange we see a conquering king but we see
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   the humble king all right let's pray
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   heavenly father would you help us to see our
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   sin that the gospel of grace would be so fresh
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   and beautiful again that this week we won't
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   fast forward to the resurrection but we'll take
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   but we'll take time to see all that our Christ did to
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:20.500]   purchase us thank you so much Lord for opening our
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   eyes to this truth help us to see ourselves in the
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   the sinner in the pages of Scripture that it might not be fresh just for a personal worship but unto your glory going out to the ends of the earth that you would be preached in our lives that we would be a proper reflection of what King Jesus actually is like thank you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.500]   let us rise as we sing our closing praise

[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:18.500]   I pray God that you would be King over all of our lives our finances our time our energies

[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   Amen
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:14:02.500]   God sent His Son and called in Jesus. He came to love. He led for love. He lived and died.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:19.500]   To buy my pardon. An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:40.500]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   Because I know He holds the future. And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:11.820]   This life is an altar.
