[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:43.160]   Thank you.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:29:13.140]   Thank you.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:43.120]   Thank you.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:30:13.100]   Thank you.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:43.080]   Thank you.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:31:13.060]   Thank you.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:43.040]   Thank you.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:32:13.020]   Thank you.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:43.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:12.980]   Thank you.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:42.960]   Thank you.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:34:12.940]   Thank you.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:19.860]   people come to me and they unload their situation hoping that I would have that flip of the switch
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:27.240]   answer. Do you know what I mean? 90% of the times, there's nothing I can say or do to make their
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:34.500]   circumstance better. Right? Like 95% of the time, what am I going to say to make the circumstance
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:40.820]   actually better? Am I going to like get rid of certain people in their lives, give them a million
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.540]   dollars? You know, just be like, ta-da, flip of the switch, like your life is better. This just doesn't
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:55.100]   happen. But this is the go-to passage for the struggles. Here, both in 1 Peter 5, that we should
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:02.000]   lay our anxieties at his feet, but also another passage, 2 Corinthians chapter 1. Blessed be the
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.960]   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, the God of all comfort, who comforts us
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:15.660]   in all our affliction, so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, but the
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:22.620]   comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:30.960]   abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ. Going down to verse 8, Apostle Paul says,
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.440]   for we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:42.580]   burdened excessively beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, we had the sentence
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.980]   of death within ourselves, so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:55.640]   who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and who will deliver us. He on whom we have set our hope,
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:02.940]   and he will yet deliver us. Wow. What an incredibly comforting and encouraging passage.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:11.740]   In thinking about this, I dare not say that like, you know, our immediate struggles, we can't exaggerate
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:17.140]   them to be like, oh, I know exactly what Apostle Paul's feeling. The scenarios are quite different,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:24.800]   right? Where we have hardship and experiences, but then Apostle Paul has literally near-death threats
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:33.240]   constantly as he travels. And both physically, he was so beaten, he essentially was just string away,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:42.160]   right? But nevertheless, the feeling of hopelessness, he explains here that the burden was so heavy,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.640]   that it was excessive and beyond strength. So the feeling there, how do we wrestle with that?
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:57.400]   My request again is, if you, if you have come tonight, resorting to over-talking it, just talking
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:03.640]   and talking and talking and talking to anybody and anybody who would possibly listen, etc. If you have
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:09.040]   been numbing it with trying to forget, or which is really, really like a modern thing, I think,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:16.640]   not necessarily modern, but a habit, it's just looking for any escape possible. Looking to get away,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:24.600]   looking for a new scenario, all that kind of stuff. Please, please don't, but rather go to God and say,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:33.020]   God, I hope in you, even when this is far, far beyond my strength. Amen? So that, the last part is,
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:41.520]   we would receive God's peace. That we would first rejoice in the Lord, request of the Lord, and then
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.620]   receive from the Lord his peace. Verse 7 says, and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:55.540]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus, we can go to God and say, in receptive,
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:05.660]   with receptive hands, thank you. I know one, you, in your grace, you hear me. Thank you. I know I have
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:12.340]   the absolute assurance that you care, and thank you. I know I have a sure found hope in you.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.340]   I know I've got everything in you. I don't have all the plans, and I don't have all the decisions
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:25.600]   exactly how they're supposed to be made, but I absolutely have hope, and that is worth so much
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:35.700]   more. There are people who move from problems to worry, deep anxiety, and then ultimately to despair.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.960]   no hope. But God says, within the midst of your suffering, within the midst of your pain,
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.440]   I will be your hope. Here's another passage, not so common, Lamentations chapter 3.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.680]   It says,
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope. The Lord's loving kindness indeed never cease,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:05.120]   for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning, great is your faithfulness.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:11.660]   The Lord is my portion, says my soul, therefore I have hope in him. The Lord is good to those who
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:18.380]   wait for him, to the person who seeks him. It is good that he waits silently for the salvation of the
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:26.120]   Lord. Obviously, this is where the famous song, Great is Thy Faithfulness, comes from. And as we take
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:33.500]   a moment to think about that, I pray that the way we handle the anxieties we carry, and truth be told,
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:39.020]   maybe some of us like, we didn't come in with like, oh, woe is me. We didn't come in here with just like,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:45.500]   oh, I've got all these burdens I'm carrying on my back, and I'm just dragging them in here. Good, you know.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:53.060]   But nevertheless, we are warned, we will. Through this life, we are going to experience suffering in the
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:40:00.540]   future. But what's more, we're going to be sometimes surrounded by people who are wrought with anxious worry,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:06.900]   wrought with heavy burdens. Can we give this encouragement that we can have our rejoicing in the
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:14.400]   Lord, we can cast all our anxieties on Christ, we can request and make all our supplications rise to the
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:25.540]   Lord. And for sure, we will receive. Let's pray. God, as we enter into time of prayer, I ask Father God that
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:34.680]   every worry that we daydream about while we're at work, all the strains, just fears we play in our minds,
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:42.260]   all the bad images of what could happen and what we could lose. Help us, Father God, not to carry these
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:49.260]   things as baggage in our minds, but God, help us to cast them all down at the feet of our Lord.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:58.640]   God, we are reminded today that you care so deeply that we are able to relinquish our prideful control
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:05.380]   over our lives. So help us do that even now, as we're joined together to lift all of our burdens
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:13.180]   and all our requests to you. We thank you, God, that in your mercy, you will hear our prayers. In Christ's name, amen.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.000]   At this time, I'm going to give you guys a minute just to come forward. Anybody who would like to come
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   forward to the front carpet area, you can come. And we're going to go into the individual time.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.040]   So as the AV team plays the just prayer time music, please go ahead and write into it. We'll give about
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:37.280]   10 minutes for you guys to just follow those steps. And again, if you've already come with just
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.980]   a desire to seek the Lord and there are things you want to address directly,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.180]   obviously, you can just put this aside for later and go directly to seek the Lord, okay? All right.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:51.960]   Please take this moment to come forward. Please kneel and take use of the space. And then I'll come back
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.540]   in 10 minutes to guide us into the next portion.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.120]   Thank you.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Thank you.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.700]   Thank you.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:27.680]   Thank you.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:57.660]   Thank you.
