[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:58.180]   - Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.140]   Let me get a few announcements.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.440]   First of all, this week is our all church praise and prayer.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.660]   And so we won't be having our regular Bible study,
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.900]   our home groups, but at 7.30, again in this room,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.980]   we'll have time of corporate prayer.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.580]   So please try to come a little bit earlier.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.260]   And again, the shuttles will be running for parking,
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.300]   but if you wanna park nearby,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.900]   it's probably best if you came a little bit earlier.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.820]   Next round of our membership class
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.260]   is happening on September 29th,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.980]   which is on a Sunday at 9.30 in the Youth Chapel.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.420]   There's an eight week course.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.000]   So if you are applying to become a member,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.400]   this is a must class that you need to take.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.460]   It's starting again on September 29th.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.500]   Regional Thanksgiving dinner hosts.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.940]   Okay, so as you guys know,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.060]   every year we have a regional Thanksgiving
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.700]   where we break up into, I forget how many,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.020]   30 or 40 different groups.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.780]   And so this is not a sign up to participate in that.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.900]   This is to host.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.900]   So if you are interested in hosting a home
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   where you'll be assigned anywhere from 20 to 25 people
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.140]   to come and to celebrate Thanksgiving together
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.260]   on that Sunday, there is a sign up table outside.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.000]   So if you walk outside, as soon as you'll run into that.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.420]   And so please sign up.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.180]   And you do need to be a member to do this.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.720]   So if you're willing to do that, please go and sign up.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.080]   We need maybe about 40 homes, okay.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.520]   And then lastly, our Reformation Night
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.580]   on October 31st at 4.30.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.380]   This is again, obviously a replacement for Halloween.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.860]   And so they need volunteers to help for that,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.280]   that night and to set up and, you know,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.000]   various things that's happening.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.160]   So if you're willing to help participate,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.760]   either for decoration or purchasing food
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   or running some of the games, if you can go and volunteer.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.300]   I think it's also at the same table.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.180]   So if you're walking out and you wanna volunteer
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.340]   for that that night, please go and sign up for that, okay.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.060]   All right, let me pray for our offering.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.600]   I'll give you a minute to give.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.940]   If you brought a physical offering,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.260]   again, we have a box in the back.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.800]   As you're walking out, you'll see it hanging on the wall.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.700]   Otherwise, I'll give you a minute to do that.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.160]   And then after our main time of praise,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.020]   our brother Bradley is going to come up
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.380]   and give his testimony and be baptized, all right.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.220]   Let's pray.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.520]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.900]   Thank you for the gathering of the saints
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.700]   that we may corporately worship you in one voice.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.300]   And I pray that you would continue
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.800]   to strengthen our community,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.660]   that we would day by day, week by week,
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.700]   become more and more like Christ,
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.380]   that we would be worshipers who will worship you
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.900]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.260]   We pray, Father God, as we've gathered here,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.860]   help us to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.140]   that we be strengthened, that we would worship,
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.560]   that even in this giving,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.220]   that it would be an act of worship and thanksgiving,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.500]   expression of our love towards you,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.660]   that it may be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.120]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:36.840]   - Hi, everyone.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.200]   I grew up in a God-centered household.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.560]   I went to church every Sunday, read the Bible every day,
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.800]   and did Bible studies every weekend.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   However, I had a very false understanding of God
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.320]   and what it truly meant to be a Christian.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   Romans 10, nine says,
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.140]   "If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.120]   "and believe in your heart
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.400]   "that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.360]   From this, I thought that all I had to do
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.640]   was somewhat believe that Christ died for me
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.440]   and then I would go to heaven.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.300]   But everything in that relationship was superficial,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.360]   and though I'd always heard that Jesus died for my sins,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.920]   nothing meant anything to me about why he did it
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.560]   and how great his love was to pay that sacrifice.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.960]   I used to think I was saved simply
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.760]   because I believed there was a God somewhere in the universe
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.720]   that I could call on for help.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.120]   But deep down, I doubted whether God even existed.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.440]   On the outside, I looked like a Christian,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.140]   but inwardly, I struggled with my faith.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.240]   As I became a teen,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.920]   I started wanting to skip church on Sundays,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.760]   and during the week,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.220]   I lived no differently than a non-believer.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.960]   Despite not believing in God,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.600]   I still convinced myself that I was somehow saved.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.760]   However, two years ago, my family changed churches.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.540]   In the first lesson in youth group,
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.600]   I learned about the parable of the sower
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.480]   and the four types of soil.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.760]   I realized that the path of a real Christian is narrow
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   and that I was actually among the many
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.320]   on the wide path toward destruction.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.400]   After that service, I felt very conflicted in my heart,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.640]   knowing that I was living with a false identity
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.520]   pretending to be a believer,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.000]   when in reality, I was far from it.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.800]   I didn't want to come back here.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.920]   I wanted to go back to our old church,
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.520]   where I could maintain my passive knowledge of God
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.720]   and take comfort that I was saved.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.080]   I didn't want to commit
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.120]   because I wanted to keep living my own way.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.840]   But we continued to come here,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.120]   and slowly, my heart and heart softened.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.000]   Phrases and songs that I'd heard for years
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.860]   started to make more sense,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.360]   and I finally understood the weight of Jesus' death
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.800]   on my life.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.920]   I felt guilty that I had lived so long for myself,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.780]   and for the first time, I understood my sinfulness.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.920]   I asked myself,
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.480]   why would Jesus want to save someone like me,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.240]   someone who's only lived for himself
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   and indulges in the world?
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.640]   What did I do to deserve any of this love?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   Then I realized that I had misunderstood
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   the gospel my entire life.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.740]   I'd always thought that faith had to be justified by works.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.320]   The faith was never like that, but by grace,
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.600]   and that Jesus died for me
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.740]   while I was still lost and confused,
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.280]   that I might ultimately be saved.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.720]   A holy God never stopped loving me despite my sin.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.040]   I finally understood what his grace meant,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.360]   and I wanted to know more about him.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.720]   I started praying every day,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.120]   and in this, I found what it truly means to be a Christian,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.400]   someone who desires to seek God,
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.320]   who understands that they're a terrible person
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.520]   deserving of the worst punishment,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.320]   but is saved by an unyielding and unconditional love
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.280]   they don't deserve.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.720]   I wanted to get baptized today
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   to unite myself in Christ's death and resurrection
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.320]   as someone with a real relationship with God,
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.480]   not one that's only on the surface.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.240]   I now understand Jesus's sacrifice for me,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.400]   and want to fully surrender and glorify God
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.560]   for the rest of my life.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.680]   Thank you.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:27:05.700]   - Do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.940]   you're (mumbles)
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.100]   come out and (mumbles)
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   and I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:22.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:32.820]   - All right, thank you, Bradley,
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.100]   for that clear and powerful testimony.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.740]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.860]   to Luke chapter nine,
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.220]   we'll be reading from verse 12 through 17.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.740]   Luke chapter nine, verses 12 through 17.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.480]   Reading out of the NSV.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.540]   Now the day was ending,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.220]   and the 12 came and said to him,
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.300]   send the crowd away that they may go
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.980]   into the surrounding villages and countryside
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.940]   and find lodging and get something to eat,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.540]   for here we are in a desolate place.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.420]   But he said to them, you give them something to eat,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.220]   and they said, we have no more than five loaves and two fish
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.420]   unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people,
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.500]   for there are about 5,000 men.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.300]   And he said to his disciples,
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.280]   have them sit down to eat in groups of about 50 each.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.140]   They did so, and had them all sit down.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.140]   Then he took the five loaves and the two fish,
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.980]   and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke them,
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.820]   and kept giving them to the disciples
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.580]   to set before the people.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.620]   And they all ate and were satisfied,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.020]   and the broken pieces which they had left over
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.940]   were picked up, 12 baskets full.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.780]   Let's pray.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.940]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.500]   We pray for deeper knowledge of who you are,
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.620]   and that we would hear your voice,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.860]   that your people may follow.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.640]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to guide and lead us,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.020]   convict us, and mold us according to your purpose.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:12.220]   Just to review, again, whenever we study the Bible,
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.700]   we need to understand the context
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.460]   in which this text is written in.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   And so we've been looking at the Gospel of Luke,
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.560]   and Jesus' primary thing that he's been doing
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.740]   up to this point is to identify his credential.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.500]   We were talking about how last week,
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.140]   King Herod was asked in a question
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.060]   because of his reputation
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.560]   and the miracles that he was performing,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.340]   and what he was preaching,
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.260]   and he says, "Could this possibly be Elijah?
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.820]   "Could this possibly be one of the prophets?
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.380]   "Could this be John the Baptist
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.740]   "who's risen from the dead?"
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.500]   And the question that he asks is, "Who is this man?"
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.220]   And that's exactly why Jesus was doing what he was doing,
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.060]   to identify his credential.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:01.020]   He was trying to show his disciples and the crowd
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.360]   his power over the storm.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.040]   And even they were amazed
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   that after walking with him for so many years,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.360]   that he had authority to just command the storm to stop,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.380]   and it stops.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.000]   We saw that he had authority over demons,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.740]   legion of demons,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.720]   that they couldn't control this man.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.000]   He was wreaking havoc in that area,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.360]   and Jesus, all he does is show up, and they're terrified.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.060]   So the disciples saw that, and they said,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.800]   "Who is this man that even the demons are terrified?"
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.200]   And then as he is going on his journey
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   to heal this young girl,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.880]   and a woman who's been hemorrhaging for 12 years,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.720]   all she does is reaches out and touches him,
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.200]   and he says, "Power leads him," and he heals him.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.600]   So he has power over nature, he has power over demons,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   he has power over disease,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.940]   and then finally, he has power over death.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.640]   And in case anybody had any question about his identity,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.420]   Jesus was making it very clear.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.100]   This miracle that he performs here,
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.760]   the feeding of the 5,000, is very unique.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.400]   Not because of the power that he was demonstrating.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.060]   He's already demonstrated his power over demons,
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.420]   and nature, and even over death.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.420]   But this is the only miracle
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.840]   that is mentioned in all four Gospels.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.420]   And it's not by accident.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.700]   You would think that the young girl
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.220]   that he raised from the dead,
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.240]   the demoniac who had legions of demons in him,
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.620]   that that would be worthy enough
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.260]   that all the disciples would remember.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.480]   That's something that needs to be into the Gospels,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.700]   that we all were able to remember.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.140]   But of all the miracles, this is the miracle.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.540]   And you can almost say it's out of the many miracles
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.040]   that he performed, it's one of the kind of mundane ones.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.500]   Just feeding people.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.460]   But this is the miracle
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.100]   that is mentioned in all four Gospels.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.080]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.260]   And when you understand the context,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.500]   and hopefully at the end of the sermon,
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.700]   that you can understand why this was recorded for everybody.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.700]   If you look at Jesus' ministry,
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.180]   he's been with his disciples
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.020]   anywhere from a year and a half to two years.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.500]   And so after this miracle,
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.300]   he's at the pinnacle of his success,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.940]   where he has thousands of people
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.100]   following him everywhere he goes.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.680]   And then after he performs his miracle,
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.600]   he begins to turn his attention toward Jerusalem.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.020]   And if you read any commentary,
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.460]   they'll tell you that his focus,
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.740]   he performs other miracles,
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.260]   but his focus now begins to be on his disciples.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.100]   He spends a lot more time privately with his disciples,
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.340]   instructing them, telling them,
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.460]   and preparing them for the cross.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.900]   And so you'll see that he begins to turn his attention
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.020]   toward his disciples,
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.300]   and he begins a slow trek down to Jerusalem.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.060]   So you can kind of say that this was
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.540]   kind of like the end of his public ministry.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.940]   Not that the public wasn't with him,
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.980]   not that he wasn't performing any kind of miracles,
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.660]   but official public ministry,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.400]   he kind of closes after this,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.260]   and then he begins to give his attention to what is private.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.540]   Now, why is this so important?
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.260]   Hopefully, we'll sum it up at the end,
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.380]   and why he left this mark,
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.780]   and why the Gospels, all four Gospels,
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.140]   remind us of this miracle.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.540]   In any time we study the Bible,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.420]   we need to understand the context, right?
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.620]   If you just read it on the surface,
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.340]   you may not understand the nuance
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.860]   of little things that are being said,
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.980]   and why they did what they did.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.940]   So what I want to start with is to understand the context,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.060]   the condition of the people,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.580]   so that you can kind of get a picture
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.300]   of what this crowd is like.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.260]   And when they said that they were hungry,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.940]   what it was actually like.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:50.260]   The excitement toward Jesus has hit its peak.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.340]   In Luke 9, 10 to 13, 10 and 11 says,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.820]   when the apostles returned,
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.860]   they gave an account to him, Jesus,
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.540]   of all that they had done,
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.860]   taking them with him,
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.700]   he withdrew by himself to a city called Bethsaida.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.340]   Bethsaida is in the other side of Galilee.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.860]   But the crowds were aware of this,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.920]   and followed him, and welcoming them,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.020]   he began speaking to them about the kingdom of God,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.620]   and curing those who had need of healing.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.260]   Now, why did Jesus take his disciples
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.900]   to the other side of the lake?
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.980]   They just came back from a long mission trip,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.180]   and they came back and reported,
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.620]   and so he was taking them to the other side of Galilee
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.340]   to rest, to take a break.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.940]   But as soon as the crowds heard that they were gone,
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.020]   they packed up their bags,
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.180]   and they chased them down to the other side.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   In John chapter six, one, it says,
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.620]   after these things, Jesus went away
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.060]   to the other side of the Sea of Galilee,
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.140]   otherwise known as Tiberias.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.420]   This is an area where it was mixed with Jews and Gentiles,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.380]   but the primary area where Jesus was doing his miracles
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.300]   was the other side.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.540]   That's where the crowds were.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.380]   But they followed Jesus all the way to the other side.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.660]   Now, you have to remember, this is not a small lake.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.060]   This is quite a trek to get to the other side.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.180]   Mark chapter 6, 33, it says,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.840]   the people saw them going, and many recognized them,
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.180]   and ran there together on foot from all the cities,
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.420]   and got there ahead of them.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.820]   They were looking for Jesus,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.500]   and when they couldn't find him, he says,
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.660]   they ran expecting, said, oh, you know what?
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.580]   We saw Jesus and his disciples get on a boat,
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.340]   and they're headed toward the other side.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.380]   As soon as they hear it, they pack up their bags,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.980]   and their children, and whatever they had,
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.060]   they go over there, and as soon as Jesus lands,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.220]   it says, the mob, again, so this is not an organized crowd.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.600]   This is not a group of people who came to a conference,
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.800]   opening, and guards coming in with name tags.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.020]   This is 5,000 men, at least that's what's recorded here,
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.020]   5,000 men who are running toward Jesus.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.860]   Now, we know that number 5,000 is just the count of men,
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.620]   that we know that there are women and children there.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.340]   You know how we know that?
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.540]   Where did he get the fish and the loaves?
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.100]   A child, a child brought it,
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.660]   so we know that there were children there,
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.240]   and we know wherever there's children,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.480]   it's not just the fathers, right?
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.620]   The mothers are nearby, so a conservative count
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.980]   of the total number of people is somewhere around 20,000.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.620]   I've read that some think it was as large as 30,000 people.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:29.460]   I don't know if you've ever seen a crowd of people,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.740]   like a mob, I don't think you've ever seen,
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.200]   maybe even on television, a mob of 20,000 people running.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   Right, that's a scary scene,
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.780]   and that's what the Bible describes,
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.300]   that they were so excited about Jesus,
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.660]   they just would not leave him alone.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:53.160]   I remember years ago, we were coming in and out of China,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.060]   and we came out of this market,
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.300]   and there was a few homeless people there asking for money,
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   and 10 kuai would be equivalent to about $1,
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.300]   and 10 kuai for them was a decent amount of money,
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.980]   they can get a meal with that.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.400]   So I reached into my pocket,
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.960]   and what I thought was 10 kuai came out at 100 kuai,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.800]   the red bill came out.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.120]   And as soon as they saw the red bill,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.800]   and I quickly tried to put it back into my pocket,
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.600]   and I remember seeing somebody grabbing my right hand,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.240]   and I forced my 100 kuai back into my pocket,
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.680]   and I saw a man, I felt a man just pulling my hand
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.280]   out of my pocket, and then I was struggling to get it in,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.300]   and the next thing I know, I feel somebody else
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.040]   on the other side reaching into my pocket,
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.420]   and I'm grabbing that person.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.120]   And next thing I know, here's this grandma
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.560]   with this small child in the back,
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.360]   searching through my pockets, and I knew I was in trouble,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.040]   and all of a sudden, I started getting attention
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.320]   of all the people there.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.680]   Next thing I knew, I had four or five different people
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.080]   grabbing at my limbs, trying to get into my pocket
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.680]   to reach for that money.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.360]   So I knew I was in trouble, so I had enough strength
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.560]   to kind of push them aside,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   because I was a grandma that was doing that.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.560]   So I pushed them aside, and I remember passing Alex,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.740]   who's in Taiwan right now, who was nearby,
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.060]   and I pushed them aside, and I started to run,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.500]   and I told Alex, hey, Alex, go and catch a taxi.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.000]   So some of you guys, there's a few people in this room
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.420]   that remember that trip, and I told Alex,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.860]   hey, go to the other side, 'cause I'm gonna run this way,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.340]   and hopefully I could ditch them,
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.980]   and then I'll come and jump into the taxi,
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.500]   and we'll get away from this.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.580]   And as I pushed them, and as I started running,
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.700]   I turned around, they started running after me.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.240]   I said, I thought that guy had a crutch, he's healed.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.600]   And so I had to run across the street,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.100]   and then I could make a sharp left turn,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.620]   and they were chasing me the whole time,
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.780]   and by the time I got to the taxi,
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.260]   Alex had a taxi ready, and I jumped into the car,
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.340]   shut the door, and even as we were taking off,
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.220]   they were banging on the door,
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.860]   because they wanted that 100 kuai.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.820]   Now, that was about four or five homeless people.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.820]   And I remember thinking, man, we got out of that,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.160]   and to this day, I tell that story, right?
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.300]   The Bible says that there were 500 men
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.340]   with their wives and children would not leave them alone.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.080]   Years ago, we used to have, we used to have, remember,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.420]   we used to have church picnics, church sports day.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.780]   Some of you guys who've been here for a while
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.560]   remember that, and we had it until we were about 400 people,
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.460]   so we used to go park nearby in Irvine,
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.620]   and we used to have games, we used to have volleyball,
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.840]   and obviously, we stopped doing that.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.720]   And part of the reason why we stopped doing that,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.300]   it was just utter chaos.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.900]   I remember having games and having
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.100]   maybe about 10 teams lined up,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.220]   and we're trying to give instructions
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.180]   of you're gonna go down, and then turn around,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.380]   and then come back, and just simple instructions,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.860]   and I remember once we got lined up,
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.500]   different people were going at different times,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.620]   and we had, you know, those megaphones?
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.700]   They were trying to say, no, we didn't start yet,
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.120]   but they're already, half of them are gone,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.500]   and just utter chaos for about an hour and a half
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.140]   because they couldn't hear our voice.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.780]   So we couldn't get anything done.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.460]   So after that, it's like, okay, that's enough.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.220]   Like, we can't do this anymore.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.000]   That's with 400 people.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.520]   This is 20,000 people who are packed up
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.060]   with small children coming after Christ.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.020]   They come after Christ, and they're so enamored with him,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.980]   they weren't even thinking.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.340]   They followed him out into the desolate place without food.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.380]   I don't know about you, but anytime we have
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.000]   an event at church, the first thing
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.020]   that we have to ask ourselves
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.860]   is how we're gonna feed these people, right?
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.740]   Yesterday, we had the BAM retreat here,
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.620]   and we had about 240 singles who met over the weekend,
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.220]   and one of the biggest things that needs to happen
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.340]   is we have to figure out the food, right?
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.180]   What are they gonna eat?
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.380]   How are they gonna eat?
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.060]   How much money is it gonna take?
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.440]   Again, that's with 200 people, right?
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.900]   The biggest problem when we go to a retreat
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.320]   with maybe about 1,000 people is the food.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.160]   Where are they gonna eat?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.240]   So every time we have a retreat,
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.280]   where are these 1,000 people gonna get in the cars
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.960]   and go and find food, and we have to distribute
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.800]   and all this?
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.380]   So imagine, 20,000 people are running to Christ
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.100]   without thinking about food with young children,
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.340]   and they come, and Jesus is ministering to them,
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.580]   and then it becomes nighttime,
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.740]   and they realize, hey, we don't have food.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.940]   What are we going to do?
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.220]   Now, that's the context.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.300]   So this is not an organized mob, an organized group.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.540]   This is not a retreat with 20,000 people.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.700]   This is not a conference where you have people
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.200]   organized, coming, sitting down, right?
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.660]   We have a schedule.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.820]   This is a mob that came after Christ
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.980]   that Jesus was ministering to.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.260]   So I want you to understand the context
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.420]   in which this takes place.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.380]   So that's the crowd.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.440]   I want you to understand the condition of the disciples.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.380]   They must have been tired, right?
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.900]   The whole reason why they're on the other side
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.740]   is to take a break.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.120]   They just came back from a long mission trip,
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.160]   and Jesus was taking them aside to get some rest,
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.980]   and this mob comes, and instead of sending them away,
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.520]   Jesus begins to minister to them.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.940]   So can you imagine how tired they must have been?
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.220]   And I've shared this before out in India.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.860]   When we do the medical camp, we have several teams.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.220]   We have the eye care team, we have the medical team,
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.260]   we have the VBS team, and then we have the security team.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.860]   We have the security because almost always
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.780]   at the end of the day, we have a larger crowd
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.940]   than when we started.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.180]   And so we need to have security in there
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.680]   because they're always pushing to try
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.600]   to get through the door 'cause they wanna see the doctors
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.800]   and get glasses or get some sort of treatment.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.960]   And so at the end of the day, the people who are at the door
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.560]   basically was wrestling with the crowd
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.500]   for four, five, six hours.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.440]   That's with maybe 100, 150, 200 people.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   This is 20,000 people with 12 disciples,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.320]   and they just wouldn't leave them alone,
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.180]   even on the other side of the sea.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.860]   Now, again, I say all of this to you
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.820]   because I want you to understand the state of mind
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.180]   that the disciples must have been in
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.060]   when the sun's going down and they see all these people
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.900]   and children running around and there's nothing to eat,
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.060]   and Luke chapter 9, 12, it says,
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.840]   "Now the day was ending and the 12 came and said to him,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.180]   "Send the crowd away."
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.200]   I want you to stop and think about that, right?
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.040]   Now, we can read that superficially and say,
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.560]   well, they were so concerned about the people.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.520]   Hey, they don't have food.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.560]   What are we gonna do about them, right?
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.160]   Could be, and I'm not saying it is not,
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.800]   but when I understand the context, when I read this,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.280]   I could tell there's a tinge of irritation
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.120]   'cause they're tired, right?
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.640]   It's not our fault that you're the one who came after us.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.600]   You wouldn't let us rest.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.420]   And you don't have food that Jesus send them away
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.060]   that they may go into the surrounding villages
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.380]   and courtside, and I think knowing all that we know,
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.820]   okay, this is an educated guess,
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.540]   that by this time they're pretty irritated
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.660]   with the crowd, right?
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.940]   And that's why when Jesus, that woman who was hemorrhaging
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.060]   touched Jesus, who touched me?
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.140]   He's like, Jesus, everybody's touching you.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.780]   What do you mean who touched you?
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.380]   I can imagine these guys are just tired
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.120]   and they're not leaving them alone.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.580]   I said, Jesus, send them away, right?
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.560]   Send them away, let them find a village,
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.580]   and maybe after they go, we can get some rest,
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.740]   or maybe we can sneak away and go to the other side, right?
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.920]   I don't know about you, but I sense
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.420]   that there's some irritation on their part, right?
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:08.060]   But what's interesting here is that Jesus
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.500]   had something in mind.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.300]   This was not just a random event.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.760]   In Luke chapter 9, 13, he said,
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.620]   but he said to them, you give them something to eat, right?
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.180]   He said, they were like, send them away,
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.200]   make them have a village, get away.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.060]   He said, no, you give them something to eat.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.860]   And they said, we have no more than five loaves
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.460]   and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.480]   for all these people, right?
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.760]   That's called sarcasm, right?
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.660]   Even if they had the money, how's 12 people
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.820]   gonna go get food for 20,000 people?
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.000]   So he's like, you want us to go get it, right?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.900]   Again, I sense some irritation.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.460]   You want us to go get food.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.500]   John 6, five through seven, it says,
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.380]   therefore Jesus, lifting up his eyes,
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.780]   seeing that a large crowd was coming to him,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.260]   said to Philip, where are we to buy bread
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.300]   so that these may eat?
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.740]   This he was saying to test him.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.340]   He had plans already to draw out his disciples
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.540]   'cause he wanted to show them something.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.920]   For he himself knew that he was intending to do,
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.580]   Philip answered, 200 denarii worth of bread
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.660]   is not sufficient for them,
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.540]   for everyone to receive a little.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.220]   200 denarii would be equivalent
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.380]   to something around $20,000.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.340]   That would be $1 per person, right?
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.220]   So imagine if by today's meal,
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.340]   it would cost at least $10 to $15
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.180]   just to get a panini, right?
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.640]   Then you might get a drink, maybe, right?
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:49.580]   $1, maybe get us some bread and some onion.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.180]   Maybe if we have a little bit left over,
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.620]   we can throw some cheese in there.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.860]   And they're saying, well, even $20,000.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.220]   They would just get a taste, that's not enough.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.720]   In other words, Jesus, what are you talking about?
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.620]   All these people need to eat
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.580]   and you're telling us that we would,
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.020]   how are we gonna do that?
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   In Mark 6:37, he answered them,
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.780]   you give them some tea, and they said to him,
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.020]   shall we go and spend 200 denarii on bread
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.660]   and give them something to eat?
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.060]   Again, sarcasm.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:24.980]   What's interesting here is that up to this point,
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.020]   they saw Jesus's power.
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.300]   This would be the minor miracle
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.600]   compared to the other stuff that they've seen.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.500]   He calmed the storm.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.920]   He said, he told the storm, he said,
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.540]   enough, and the storm obeys.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.180]   A legion of demons, they shudder in fear,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.800]   and he commands this legion of demons
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.360]   to get out, and they get out.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.380]   Diseased woman, just by touching him,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.340]   being near him, is healed.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.540]   This hemorrhaging woman.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.140]   A dead child is raised simply by his word.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.780]   They saw this, they had front row seats to all of this,
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.220]   but when Jesus said, you feed them,
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.900]   he's like, what?
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.860]   What are you talking about?
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.900]   How are we gonna do this?
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   We don't have enough money.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.660]   You want us to go get the food?
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.860]   Why was it so hard for them to believe?
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:18.120]   Are we any different?
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.540]   You know, we get together and we talk about
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.380]   how awesome God is and how he created the universe
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.220]   and where everything's made by him and for him,
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.260]   but the thing that we wrestle with
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.020]   is not the creation of the universe
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.820]   or that Jesus died for our sins
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.420]   and we're gonna go to heaven in eternity
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.380]   and a new heaven and new earth is gonna be created.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.220]   It's like, we believe all that.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.260]   We sing about all that.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.860]   We praise God for that, but we wrestle with like,
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.600]   is he really gonna pay our bills?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.100]   Is he really gonna take care of our needs?
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.140]   It's the mundane, pedestrian things,
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.980]   common things that we wrestle with.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.780]   There's a reason why Jesus says in Romans 8:32,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.880]   he who did not spare his own son,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.180]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.900]   gave his only begotten son up for us.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.080]   How will he not, along with him, give us all these things?
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.100]   If he gave his only begotten precious son,
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.020]   why do you have such a hard time believing
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.720]   that all the other things that God would not withhold?
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.740]   And yet, isn't that who we are?
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.100]   It's the mundane things.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.220]   We become blinded to the things that are around us,
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.900]   so easy, that we're able to take care of,
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.140]   and those are the areas that we kind of
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.100]   have a difficult time believing in God.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.740]   We only believe in God that's far away,
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.180]   and does mighty, great things
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.060]   that we can't even possibly imagine,
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.660]   but anything that you and I think
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.900]   that we are capable of doing,
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.460]   we have a hard time believing that he's gonna step in.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.420]   That's our tendency.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.580]   We are oftentimes blinded to the most mundane things,
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.900]   and the most powerful miracles in life
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.320]   are usually pretty mundane.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.580]   The fact that you and I breathe,
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.340]   it's mundane, but it's a miracle of God.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.980]   The fact that we're not destroyed,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.180]   mundane, miracle of God.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.100]   Think how often we celebrate people
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.180]   who remember our birthdays,
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.500]   and wow, they're such a good friend.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.820]   They're such a good friend.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.860]   They do so much for us.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.700]   They remember.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.660]   They're so kind.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.460]   And then the mom who wakes up every single morning
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.060]   to cook you breakfast.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.560]   I don't want eggs today.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   Again, the people who do the most for us,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.720]   we have a tendency to be blind toward.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.400]   So as much as we look at this,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.080]   how can they not have believed this?
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.000]   We all struggle with it, right?
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.300]   The things that are nearby, things that are close,
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   things that you and I think that we are capable of doing,
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.800]   we have a hard time believing.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   The disciples had a difficult time.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.920]   Like, what are we, how are we possibly gonna feed them?
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   So it's in that context, right,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.320]   that we need to understand Jesus' response.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.760]   If the disciples were tired,
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.280]   imagine the one that they were chasing after.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   They were trying to get through the disciples
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.720]   just to touch him, just to be near him.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.000]   He goes to the other side in Matthew 14, 13 to 14.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.560]   Now when Jesus heard about John,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.360]   he withdrew from there in a boat
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.320]   to a secluded place by himself.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.600]   And when the people heard of this,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.680]   they followed him on foot from the cities.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.960]   And when he went ashore, he saw a large crowd
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.060]   and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:48.640]   Now imagine if Jesus was so dead tired
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.860]   that in the middle of the storm, he was sleeping.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.680]   And the disciples are like, do you not care?
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.080]   Imagine, just humanly speaking,
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.720]   how tired he must have been that he wasn't waking up,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.080]   that the professional fishermen were afraid for their life.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.320]   Can you imagine the water coming into this boat?
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.640]   And Jesus was so knocked out.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.320]   That's how tired he was.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.080]   So he goes to the other side to take a break
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.880]   and they come running toward him.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.560]   How would you have reacted if that happened?
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.960]   I don't know about you, but I think most of us,
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.880]   no matter how benevolent and patient and kind you are,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.280]   it's like, really?
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.360]   After all that, you're not gonna give me a minute?
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.800]   You're not gonna give me a minute?
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.160]   I could imagine the disciples
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.480]   were probably thinking the same thing.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.320]   Really?
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.340]   There's a reason why we got on the boat.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.880]   To get away from you, just one night.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.040]   One night.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.680]   Give us a break.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.640]   And they see thousands of them running toward him
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.320]   and Jesus' response when he went ashore,
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.880]   he saw a large crowd, had compassion.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.660]   Instead of being irritated, it says,
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.320]   he began to heal them again.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.560]   He kept on doing his ministry.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.260]   In Mark 6, 34, when Jesus went ashore,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.700]   he saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.420]   because they were like sheep without a shepherd
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.760]   and he began to teach them many things.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.280]   He was on his break.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.380]   I mean, if anybody deserved a little break, it was Jesus.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.620]   And when they came to him, instead of being irritated,
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.940]   he says he began to heal them.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.140]   He began to teach them.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:29.020]   And they were like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.240]   So we can understand why Jesus was so dead tired
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.080]   in that boat.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.700]   They just would not leave him alone.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.500]   But he saw them and he had compassion.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.740]   A sheep without a shepherd is completely helpless.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.500]   A sheep without a shepherd is hopeless.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.280]   It's vulnerable.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.200]   The wolves can come and attack them at any time.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.340]   They don't know how to eat.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.740]   They don't know how to live.
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.980]   So in the midst of his fatigue,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.620]   his disciples being irritated,
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.540]   trying to go and get a break,
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:08.340]   he sees them coming and says he had compassion.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:13.160]   Did Jesus need to feed them?
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.120]   It wasn't like a conference where they advertise
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.780]   and he drew a crowd to himself.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.960]   He was trying to get away from the crowd.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.460]   This was a mob who ran toward him.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.460]   It's your fault.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.900]   You came to him.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.660]   Can you imagine anything that you do
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.420]   where you don't calculate the food?
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.940]   Everywhere you travel, you have to figure out
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.780]   how we're gonna eat.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.600]   Do they have breakfast there?
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.440]   Are we gonna eat lunch?
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.580]   Are we gonna eat dinner?
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.520]   Especially if you have small children.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.100]   If you don't figure out how your children are gonna eat,
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.340]   you can't go.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.180]   I don't care.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.180]   Maybe you love Hawaii, but there's no food there.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.140]   You can't go.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.100]   These guys were so enamored with Christ.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.740]   They didn't think about bringing food.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.560]   They just ran.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.400]   Where is he?
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.740]   Picked up their bags, their kids,
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.260]   and from all over, they ran to him,
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.240]   and then it was getting late at night,
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.780]   and they realized, shoot, we forgot to bring food.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.820]   What are we gonna do?
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.020]   Instead of being irritated,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:13.020]   Jesus begins to heal them and begins to teach them,
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.180]   and then he even feeds them.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.100]   This is who our God is, not just here.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.980]   If you read the Old Testament carefully,
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.620]   a lot of people read the Old Testament superficially
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.980]   and say, oh, he destroyed the Canaanites,
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.060]   and he brought the judgment, the flood.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:38.480]   Doesn't judgment make sense?
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.020]   If somebody robbed your house, don't you want justice?
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:48.140]   If you sent a kid to school and a bully beat up your kid,
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.640]   don't you want justice?
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.240]   If somebody came and robbed your car,
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.800]   you're not hoping grace for them.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.600]   Where are the police?
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.360]   How come we're allowing all this crime to take place?
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:07.040]   So doesn't justice make sense?
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:11.080]   If you anger this holy God, and he's gonna crush you,
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.000]   who are you?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.600]   Who am I?
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.720]   Just start over, crush it, start over.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.520]   His justice makes sense.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.360]   His anger makes sense.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.460]   What doesn't make sense is his compassion.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.640]   In fact, in the Old Testament law,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.480]   when he told the Israelites, when you harvest,
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.680]   leave the corner of your harvest alone.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.800]   For what purpose?
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.640]   'Cause when the foreigners come into town,
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.560]   this is during a period when they don't have restaurants,
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.520]   they don't have places to go.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.440]   If a foreigner comes into town,
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.680]   and they don't have anything to eat,
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.000]   leave a portion of that so that they can eat.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.680]   Who cares?
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   Why are they traveling without food?
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.800]   These foreigners, these pagans,
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   these idol worshipers, they're coming into Israel.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.200]   Who cares about these foreigners?
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.000]   Let them starve.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.560]   But he put it into their law.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.240]   Leave that corner for them,
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.360]   so that these foreigners are coming in
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.520]   so that they can eat.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.200]   Why does he care?
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.720]   In fact, it says, he took the five loaves
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.320]   in Luke 9, 16, 17, and the two fish,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.720]   and looking up to heaven, he blessed them
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.120]   and broke them and kept giving them
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.000]   to the disciples and set them before the people.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.880]   And they all ate and were satisfied.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.780]   Satisfied meaning that they were full.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.440]   And the broken pieces, which they had left over,
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.000]   picked up 12 basketfuls.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.240]   There's two things I wanna mention here.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.860]   One, why does he even use the five loaves and two fish?
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.580]   Right?
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.100]   I mean, five loaves and two fish.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.660]   It's interesting because when we think of five loaves,
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.720]   it's usually like loaves, right?
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.900]   And even that's not enough.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.540]   But when you actually understand what the loaf means
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.140]   at that time, it's biscuits.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.540]   So basically, it was his mom packed him
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:06.940]   just enough food for him, for a child, right?
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.200]   Why does he even need that to feed 20,000 people?
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.740]   And yet he does.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.900]   And that's how he works.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.140]   That's a pattern in which he,
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.420]   why does he need the 12 disciples to go proclaim the gospel?
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.220]   These guys who betrayed him right before he goes
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.880]   to the cross, you're gonna use these guys?
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.340]   He's gonna use us?
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:33.020]   Just think about just this week, how distracted you were.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.540]   Just think about this week, how anxious you were.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:40.180]   The people that hurt you, that you kept regurgitating.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.420]   And he's gonna save the world through us?
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.900]   Can you imagine this kid who gave Jesus
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.980]   the five loaves and three fish?
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   And you know, he probably went home and said,
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.860]   you know that food you ate, right?
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.700]   That was mine.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.720]   So what are you talking about?
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.740]   We fed 20,000 people.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.980]   I know.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.040]   I'm the one who gave it to him, right?
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.620]   And he probably became a celebrity.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.500]   I'll bet you for the rest of his life,
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.820]   he's like, oh, that's the five loaves, three fish kid.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.940]   That's the kid, probably until the day he died.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.220]   I bet you on his gravestone, he says,
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.000]   five loaves, three fish.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.920]   That's probably what he had.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.180]   That's what probably he was known for
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.480]   for the rest of his life.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.740]   But the reason why he was probably highlighted
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:27.800]   is simply because God used him.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.180]   Can you imagine him walking around?
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.140]   He's like, yeah, I did it.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:35.140]   Without my five loaves and three fish,
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.820]   Jesus would have never been able to feed
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.020]   these 20,000 people, right?
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.340]   Can you imagine that?
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.000]   Can you imagine how ridiculous that must have sounded?
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.760]   And yet, that's what we struggle with
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.960]   when God uses us.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.180]   It's like, oh, it's because God recognized my talent.
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.680]   God recognized what I have.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.760]   I actually had a pastor friend many years ago
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.500]   who told me that he thinks that the reason why Japan
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.880]   is so hardened toward the gospel
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.760]   is because the right people haven't gone.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.600]   And obviously, he was a young man when he said this,
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.440]   and he said, I think God can use me in Japan.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.320]   'Cause he was a great preacher, bearing a lot of fruit,
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.960]   and he said, if God sends me to Japan,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.080]   I think I can bear fruit there.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.100]   Can you imagine how ridiculous that must have sounded?
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.680]   Well, that pastor no longer walks with the Lord.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.840]   He fell into some sin, he was disqualified.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.320]   And as foolish as that sounds,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.480]   the only reason why he allows us to participate
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.700]   is his grace.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.320]   Not because he needs us.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.640]   Don't you think evangelism would be better
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.880]   if we moved out of the way and God just said, believe?
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.200]   And he just got his Bible and just gave it to you.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.960]   It's like, oh my gosh!
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.180]   Don't you think it'd be much more effective
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.480]   than a bunch of people who are wrestling, struggling,
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   and doubting, and infighting, and questioning each other,
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.040]   and that we're the avenue in which God's going to use
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.400]   to bring the gospel to the world?
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.000]   And yet, he does.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.340]   But that's why his primary instruction to us is to abide.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:33.320]   And as soon as they got proud, remember what Paul said?
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.340]   Not many of you are wise, not many of you were smart,
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.660]   not many of you were noble.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.380]   God chose the base thing.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.020]   He chose you because you are base,
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.620]   because you are nothing, to dumbfound the wise, right?
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:54.760]   Because of, that's why his primary instruction is to abide.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.100]   And some of you might not like this,
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.540]   but the reason why he tells us to abide
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.620]   is because he doesn't trust us, right?
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.780]   I mean, that goes against everything that I hear.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.500]   God believes in you.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.800]   He doesn't believe in you.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.020]   He doesn't believe in you.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.180]   I don't believe in you.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:17.200]   I don't believe in myself.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.560]   He didn't give these 12 people who are utter failures
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.400]   and say, you know what?
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.240]   I'm gonna give you another chance
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.100]   because now I believe in you, right?
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.740]   And imagine if that was the case.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.860]   Peter was already compromised.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.940]   Paul had to rebuke him and had to record that
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.380]   in Galatians for eternity.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.260]   Believe in it, you're gonna believe this guy?
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:46.260]   No, it was his grace that allowed this boy to participate.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:51.020]   And his claim to fame was simply
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.660]   that God used what he had.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:56.740]   That's all he's telling us to do.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.900]   Just all he's telling us to do.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.820]   Trust me.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.460]   Trust me, abide in me.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.060]   I will do the work.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.380]   I will multiply what you have.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.340]   I will do it.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.780]   But you know what's also interesting
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.420]   is that after he does that,
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.240]   he says there were 12 baskets left over.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.460]   If we had an event and we made food
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.900]   and we had 12 baskets left over,
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.220]   we would probably have an immediate meeting and say,
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.180]   hey, we didn't calculate this correctly.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.220]   That was a waste.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.300]   Was Jesus not counting?
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.700]   Is that why?
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.520]   Was that a mistake?
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.860]   He over-calculated?
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.500]   Did he multiply too much?
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.160]   And that's why he had 12 baskets?
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.860]   Well, guess what?
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.500]   Guess who had to carry those 12 baskets?
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.740]   Right?
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.980]   Who would be the candidate that would be the best fit
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.860]   to carry these 12 baskets?
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.660]   I'm guessing that every one of those disciples
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.460]   had to strap that on and when Jesus said, let's go,
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.180]   it was like, oh, I'm already tired.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.460]   Now I gotta carry this?
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.300]   Now why do you think he did that?
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.660]   He had already told us that Jesus was deliberately
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.060]   doing this to draw them out.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.420]   I bet you every time they had that strapped that on,
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.040]   he was like, don't ever question me again.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.060]   He said, how are you?
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.540]   And then they look at the basket and they're like,
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.340]   oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.660]   What was he trying to teach them?
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:33.420]   Not only about who he is, his credential to his disciples,
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.080]   but why the leftover?
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.300]   Because the purpose of this miracle ultimately
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.080]   was to reveal himself.
