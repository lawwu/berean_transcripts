[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:39.800]   Good morning, Church family. Happy Lord's Day. We will now begin our service.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:06:09.780]   We will now begin our service.

[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   We will now begin our service.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   We will now begin our service.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   We will now begin our service.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   We will now begin our service.

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   We will now begin our service.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.980]   Precious Savior, stout our refuge.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.480]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.640]   Do your friends despise, forsake you.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.060]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.240]   In His arms, He'll take and shield you.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.460]   You will find us always there.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:37.840]   If you are visiting Berean for the first time, I want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.620]   Thank you for joining us on this Sunday morning for worship.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.660]   And if you have any further questions about our church, there's a welcome booth outside.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.380]   So after service, please be sure to visit the welcome booth.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.280]   I do have a few announcements.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:01.080]   If you're interested in the golf tournament, registration for the 2025 golf tournament fundraiser is now open.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.280]   All proceeds will go towards the general missions fund.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.040]   So please check out the website for additional information.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.820]   For first service, I made a big boo-boo and I said that this is only for members.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.900]   But this is for members and non-members of the church.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.560]   So please check our website for additional information.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.760]   Rookie mistake.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:29.220]   And then this coming Sunday, July 27th, the youth group will be preparing a Korean barbecue plate.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.560]   The price for that is $10 for adults and $5 for children.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.660]   And the funds will go towards supporting their retreat for next year.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.660]   And you can actually prepay a four-year meal if you scan the QR code.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.620]   And so I want to encourage you to please support our youth group as they are trying to raise funds for their retreat.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:57.800]   And then, again, this coming Sunday, July 27th at 2 p.m., here at the main sanctuary, we will have a members meeting.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.720]   So if you are a member, please attend our upcoming members meeting this Sunday.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.800]   If you will be absent, please fill out the form to let us know that you will be unable to attend.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.120]   And then following our worship, we will have a video from the Korea mission team.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.860]   And also a testimony from our brother Chase, who recently came back from Korea.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.080]   And then, yeah, looking forward to hearing his testimony.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.920]   And then if you have a physical offering, please drop it off at the box near the exit there.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.680]   And you can also give virtually using our app.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.000]   So please prepare your hearts to give offering.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.480]   But let's pray for the offering, and then we'll worship.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.160]   Father, we want to thank you for this morning.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.420]   Thank you for allowing us to be here to worship you freely and to hear the proclamation of your word.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.780]   At this time, as we are giving, I pray that we would give willingly and with a cheerful heart,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.620]   knowing that you love those who give with a cheerful heart.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.440]   Help us to realize that everything that we possess is from you.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.800]   And all we are doing is returning back to you what rightfully belongs to you,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.740]   so that you may use it for your glory and for your purpose.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.880]   And so I pray that even in our giving, we will worship you and that we would honor you.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.900]   And so, Lord, thank you again for giving us even the opportunity to give back.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.620]   And so we pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.360]   Amen.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.500]   Amen.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.500]   Amen.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   Amen.

[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   Amen.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   Amen.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   Amen.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   Amen.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:54.480]   Thank you.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:06.100]   Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:36.080]   Thank you.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   Thank you.

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.440]   Delights
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.060]   Your power is on you
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.940]   We love your hearts
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.760]   No way to sacrifice
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.020]   When you lay down your life
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.000]   We turn aside the angels
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.420]   Praise the day and night
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.420]   Glorious Christ
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:22.460]   In the air of heaven
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.660]   To break the dust of earth
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.880]   Drove among the outcasts
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:42.920]   We came to be forsaken
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.400]   We died to take our purse
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.180]   So you can be our joy
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.440]   Forevermore
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.600]   Forevermore
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.960]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.140]   Greatest of all delights
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.760]   Your power is on you
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.600]   Your love beyond our hearts
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.540]   No greater sacrifice
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.720]   When you lay down your life
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.700]   We join the song of angels
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.080]   We pray today and night
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.800]   Glorious Christ
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.440]   It's your song now
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.960]   You'll see you now in heaven
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.420]   You've thrown at God's right hand
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.480]   You've shattered death and freed us from our fears
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.460]   And though we cannot see you
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.840]   You're coming back again
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.000]   And all will be made proud
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.500]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.800]   And all will be made proud
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.120]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.240]   You are the glorious Christ
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.540]   Greatest of all delights
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.160]   Your power is unequal

[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:34.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.980]   And to surrender.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.980]   We followed up with him the next day.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   And now he is meeting weekly.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.980]   With the LDI Church member.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.980]   To study the Bible.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.980]   His name is Roy.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   And he is a fourth year student at Yonsei.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.980]   He has never been to America.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.980]   And yet he had near perfect English.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.980]   Could you please pray that his heart would be the good soil.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.980]   That produces the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   I was just so thankful that God was able to use us.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.980]   In this miraculous way.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   And after that interaction.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.980]   I was just thinking.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.980]   Isn't this why we live?
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.980]   Isn't this what we live for?
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.980]   God is working in Korea.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.980]   And hope is not lost.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.980]   There are faithful saints laboring for the Gospel.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   Among the younger generation.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.980]   And we had the joy of co-laboring with them.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   We were so encouraged by them.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   And these are people who are sacrificing much.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.980]   Because they see what many have overlooked.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.980]   The urgent need for the Gospel.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.980]   The need for the Word of God.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.980]   The full counsel of God to be taught clearly.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   Is greater than ever.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   So could you please continue praying.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.980]   One, pray for the brothers and sisters we partnered with.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   That they would remain steadfast.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   And faithful in their Gospel work.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.980]   As it could get discouraging.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.980]   And witnessing week in and week out.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.980]   Could you pray for the churches in Korea.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.980]   That they would not turn to the left or to the right.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   From the word.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   There is a temptation to rely on strategy.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   Or methods to reach the next generation.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   But may they trust in the simple and powerful preaching of the word.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.980]   Knowing it does not return void.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   And lastly.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.980]   Could you please pray that God would open a door to Korea.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   As the need has never been clear.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.980]   And that the leaders would have the wisdom and sensitivity.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.980]   To know where to lead the church.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.980]   Thank you for supporting us in prayer.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   And for being part of the work God is doing in Korea.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   Thank you Chase for sharing that testimony.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.980]   And as he has said.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   Let's please continue to pray for Korea.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   And that the Lord will do a mighty work there again.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.980]   If you have your Bibles.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   I want to invite you to turn with me to James chapter 2.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.980]   James chapter 2.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.980]   And this morning we're reading from verse 14.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   Down to verse 26.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   These are the words of the Lord.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.980]   What use is it my brethren.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   If someone says he has faith.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.980]   But he has no works.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.980]   Can that faith save him.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   If a brother or sister is without clothing.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   And in need of daily food.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.980]   And one of you says to them.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.980]   Go in peace.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   Be warmed and be filled.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   And yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.980]   What use is that?
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   Even so faith.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.980]   If it has no works.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.980]   Is dead.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.980]   Being by itself.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   But someone may well say.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   You have faith.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   And I have works.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.980]   Show me your faith without the works.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.980]   And I will show you my faith by my works.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.980]   You believe that God is one.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   You do well.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.980]   The demons also believe in shudder.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.980]   But are you willing to recognize.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.980]   You foolish fellow.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.980]   That faith without works is useless.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   Was not Abraham our father justified by works.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   When he offered up Isaac his son on the altar.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.980]   You see that faith was working with his works.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   And as a result of the works.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   Faith was perfected.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   And the scripture is fulfilled which says.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   And Abraham believed God.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.980]   And it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   And he was called the friend of God.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   You see that a man is justified by works.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   And not by faith alone.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   So in the same way was not Rahab the harlot.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   Also justified by works.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.980]   When she received the messengers.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.980]   And sent them out by another way.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.980]   For just as the body without the spirit is dead.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.980]   So also faith without works is dead.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   Let's say a word of prayer.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.980]   Father just as our brother Chase had shared.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.980]   I pray.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   That the mission will continue in Korea.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.980]   That hearts will be cultivated.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   Ready to receive your word.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.980]   And that you would once again.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.980]   Grant repentance to the nation.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   Who once sought you.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   I pray that you would bring them back.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.980]   To truth.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   I pray that the church will live again.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.980]   And that many people will come to repentance.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   At this time I pray.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.980]   That as we're hearing your word.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   You would illuminate our hearts to receive.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.980]   And understand your word.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.980]   And I pray.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.980]   As James had been mentioning.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   Very clearly in his word.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.980]   That we are not just hearers of the word.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   But doers.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   And so I pray.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.980]   That you would lead us.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   In this time.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.980]   And I pray that you would be honored.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   And we pray all this.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   In the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   Amen.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   Amen.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   So what does it mean.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   To have faith.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.980]   And are we saved.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.980]   Because we simply make a claim to faith.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   faith.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   I want to remind you this morning.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.980]   That mere profession of faith.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.980]   Is not evidence of saving faith.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.980]   And I do want to encourage everyone here.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.980]   To examine yourself.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   To see if you are truly in the faith.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.980]   True.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.980]   Saving faith is not revealed.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.980]   By mere profession.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   But also by practice.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   If my profession of faith.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   Does not match my practice in life.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.980]   James says.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   That kind of faith.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.980]   Is dead.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.980]   And he repeats this.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.980]   In verse 17.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   Verse 20.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.980]   And verse 26.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.980]   That without works.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.980]   Faith is dead.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   And let me give you some context.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.980]   Before we examine our text this morning.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.980]   James wrote this letter.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.980]   To a majority Jewish.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.980]   Christian audience.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.980]   Now.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.980]   When the early Jewish believers.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   Heard the liberating truth.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   Of the gospel.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.980]   Of our savior.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   They received it with joy.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.980]   And abandoned their extreme practices.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980]   Of Judaism.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   However.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.980]   In their rejection.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.980]   Of legalistic Judaism.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.980]   They went to the opposite extreme.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.980]   Thinking that works.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.980]   Didn't matter at all.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   And so.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.980]   James had to address this problem.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:29.980]   In the early church.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.980]   And he was saying.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   In effect.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   That the genuineness.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.980]   Of our faith.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980]   Must be revealed.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.980]   In what we do.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.980]   More than what we say.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.980]   You see.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   A person.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   Who merely professes Christ.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   As Lord.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   But does not live.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   An obedient life.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980]   To honor Christ.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.980]   Must examine himself.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.980]   To see.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   If he truly is.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980]   In the faith.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.980]   And I want you to understand.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   That not all appearances.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.980]   Of faith.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   Are saving faith.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.980]   You can accept.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   The invitation.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.980]   To say the sinners prayer.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.980]   You can agree.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.980]   With the gospel.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.980]   Of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.980]   That it is true.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   But if there isn't.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   Noticeable change.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.980]   In your life.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.980]   If there is.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.980]   No evidence.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.980]   Of true repentance.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.980]   Producing works.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   Of righteousness.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   Scripture.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   Tells us.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.980]   That faith.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.980]   Is a dead faith.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.980]   During the baptism.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.980]   Of.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.980]   Or the baptism ministry.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.980]   Of John.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.980]   The Baptist.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   In other words.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   John.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   John.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   The Baptist.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   Was saying.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   Don't just trust.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   In your heritage.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.980]   For your salvation.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   And you know.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   This is similar.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.980]   To say.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   My parents.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.980]   Are Christians.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   And I grew up.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.980]   In the church.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.980]   John.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:32.980]   John says.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.980]   Don't do that.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.980]   Don't count.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:34.980]   Your heritage.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   For salvation.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   If you truly believe.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   God.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   And you belong.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   To him.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.980]   You will give.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.980]   Evidence.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   Of January.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   God.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   God.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.980]   That is to come.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:44.980]   God.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.980]   That is to come.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   And then he says.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   Therefore.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.980]   Bear fruit.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:47.980]   In keeping.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.980]   With repentance.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.980]   Not supposing.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   That you can say.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   To yourself.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   We have.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.980]   Abraham.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.980]   As our father.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:54.980]   Our parents.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.980]   Are Christians.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.980]   And I grew up.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   In the church.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   John says.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.980]   Don't do that.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.980]   Don't count.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   Your heritage.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   For salvation.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.980]   If you truly.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   Believe.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.980]   God.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   And you belong.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   To him.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   You will give.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   Evidence.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   Evidence.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.980]   Of your sins.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:12.980]   And producing.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.980]   Works of obedience.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.980]   Jesus said.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   In Matthew.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.980]   Chapter 5.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.980]   Verse 16.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.980]   Let your light.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.980]   Shine before men.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   In such a way.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.980]   That they may see.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   Your good works.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   And glorify your father.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   Who is in heaven.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.980]   We must manifest.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.980]   Observable.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:26.980]   Good works.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   As a testimony.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   Of our faith.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   To Jesus Christ.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   Then in Matthew.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.980]   Chapter 7.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   Verse 21.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.980]   Jesus said.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:33.980]   Not everyone.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.980]   Who says to me.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.980]   Lord.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   Lord.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   Will enter.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   The kingdom.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   Of heaven.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.980]   But he who does.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   The will.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   Of my father.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.980]   Who is in heaven.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   You see.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.980]   It's not merely.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   Saying you believe.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   But actually.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.980]   Committing yourself.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.980]   To the truth.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.980]   And doing the will.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.980]   Of the father.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.980]   But along.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   With that confession.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.980]   Is the commitment.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.980]   To live a God.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   Honoring life.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.980]   You know.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.980]   Jesus encountered.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   Many superficial.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.980]   Believers.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.980]   During his earthly ministry.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980]   In fact.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.980]   The word of God.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.980]   Tells us.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.980]   In John chapter 2.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   Beginning in verse 23.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   Now.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   When he was in Jerusalem.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.980]   At the Passover.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.980]   During the feast.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.980]   Many believed.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.980]   In his name.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   Observing his signs.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   Which he was doing.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.980]   But then verse 24.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:19.980]   Tells us.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.980]   But Jesus.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.980]   On his part.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.980]   Was not entrusting himself.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.980]   To them.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.980]   For he knew.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:25.980]   All men.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.980]   And because.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.980]   He did not need.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.980]   Anyone to testify.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.980]   Concerning man.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   For he himself knew.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.980]   What was in.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.980]   Man.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.980]   Now.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.980]   The question is.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.980]   Why didn't Jesus.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   Entrust himself.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.980]   To the many.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.980]   Who believed in him.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   In my early experience.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   As a Christian.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   I heard.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   That all I had to do.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   Was believe.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.980]   And I'll be okay.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   With God.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   And that is until.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   I learned.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   From scripture.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.980]   That salvation.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   Is not just saying.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   That I believe.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.980]   Salvation.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   Is not just.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.980]   Forgiveness of sins.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   But it actually.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   Involves.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   A renewed life.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   In Christ Jesus.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   You see.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.980]   My salvation.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.980]   In Christ.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.980]   Involves.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   A transformation.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   Of life.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   That surrenders.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:09.980]   As a renewed.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   Desire.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   To honor him.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   In my obedience.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.980]   Jesus.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:14.980]   Did not.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   Entrust himself.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.980]   To the Jewish people.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.980]   Of that generation.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980]   Because they did not.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   Belong to him.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   You see.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.980]   They believe.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   Certain truths.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   About Jesus.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   I mean.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.980]   They witnessed.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.980]   His power.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.980]   The signs.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.980]   The miracles.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   But you see.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   They did not.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   Trust him.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   As their savior.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   Nor did they surrender.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   To him.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   As Lord.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.980]   And we're going to see.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   In a moment.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   That no matter.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.980]   It may be.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.980]   Merely agreeing.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   With the facts.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   About Jesus.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   Does not count.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.980]   As saving faith.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   John tells us.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   Many came to believe.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.980]   In Jesus.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   But in John chapter 8.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   Verse 31.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   Jesus is recorded.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.980]   Speaking to the same.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   Group of Jewish people.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   Who believed in him.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   And this is what.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   He said to them.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.980]   If you continue.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   In my word.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.980]   Then you are truly.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   Disciples of mine.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.980]   And you will know.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:00.980]   The truth.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.980]   And the truth.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   Will make you free.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   Jesus.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.980]   A true believer.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.980]   In Christ.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:06.980]   Will obey his word.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   And did you know.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   That the same.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980]   Group of Jewish people.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   Who believed.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.980]   In Jesus.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980]   Later on.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.980]   Accused Jesus.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.980]   Of being born.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.980]   Out of wetlock.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.980]   They called him.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.980]   A Samaritan.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:17.980]   They said.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.980]   That he was.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.980]   Demon possessed.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   And they picked up.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   Stones.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.980]   To stone him.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.980]   Because he was speaking.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   To the truth.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   To them.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   The truth.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.980]   See Jesus knew.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.980]   What was in their heart.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.980]   This is why.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   He did not entrust himself.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980]   To them.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   And you know.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   There are many people.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.980]   In the church.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.980]   Who merely profess.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   Faith in Jesus.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.980]   But Jesus does not.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   Entrust himself.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   To them.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.980]   And that is because.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.980]   He knows.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   What's in their heart.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   That it is not.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.980]   Committed to him.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:46.980]   Jesus said.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.980]   These people.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.980]   They honor me.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   With their lips.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   But their heart.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   Is far from me.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   And you know.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   Many Christians.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.980]   Today.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:55.980]   Possess.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.980]   A faith.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   That is not.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.980]   Accompanied.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   By works.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   Of obedience.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   They believe in God.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   They believe in Christ.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   But they don't believe it.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   Until the point.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.980]   Of salvation.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.980]   You see.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   They may agree.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   With the gospel.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   And accept certain truths.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   About Jesus.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   But they do not.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.980]   Demonstrate.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.980]   True commitment.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.980]   To him.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   They love hearing.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.980]   About Jesus.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.980]   Dying for them.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.980]   On the cross.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.980]   But when they're.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   Asked.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.980]   To die to self.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   And obey.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.980]   The commandments.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:24.980]   In the new.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   They protest.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.980]   And say.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:27.980]   Well.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.980]   That's legalism.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.980]   And they ignore.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.980]   The fact.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   That Jesus said.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.980]   If you love me.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   Keep my commandments.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   He said.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.980]   If you love me.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.980]   You will keep.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.980]   My commandments.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980]   But you see.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   They have no desire.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   To demonstrate.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.980]   A changed life.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   That comes.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   With true salvation.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.980]   And obedience.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   You know.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.980]   One of the faulty.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.980]   Assumptions.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:49.980]   In modern.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.980]   Christianity.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:50.980]   Is that.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980]   Mere.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:51.980]   Acknowledgement.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   Of the gospel.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.980]   Is sufficient.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980]   For salvation.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.980]   Just believe.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.980]   Is the model.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.980]   Of Christian evangelism.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.980]   Today.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   And so.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   If you agree.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   With the gospel.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   All you have to do.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   Is walk down the aisle.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   And say the sinner's prayer.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.980]   And you will be saved.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.980]   That is what they tell them.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.980]   And so.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.980]   They treat the sinner's prayer.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.980]   Like a formula.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   For salvation.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   And anyone.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.980]   Who simply says.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   The sinner's prayer.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:15.980]   Are saved.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.980]   And many of these.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.980]   Christian events.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.980]   Post on their.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.980]   Social media page.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.980]   Saying.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   A thousand people.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:23.980]   Committed their lives.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.980]   To Jesus.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:25.980]   Today.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.980]   And they all do this.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.980]   Sometimes.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   Without any follow-up.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.980]   To see.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.980]   If any of these people.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   Are truly committed.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.980]   To Christ.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   And obedience.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.980]   And if you ask me.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.980]   Yes.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.980]   In which a thousand people.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.980]   Would commit their lives.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980]   To Jesus.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   As a pastor.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.980]   I pray.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.980]   That men.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.980]   Everywhere.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.980]   Would repent.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.980]   And believe.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.980]   In Christ.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.980]   For salvation.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.980]   But I want us.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:48.980]   To think biblically.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.980]   This morning.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.980]   Are we saved.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   Because we repeated.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.980]   A few words.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.980]   And made a claim.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.980]   To faith.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.980]   Publicly.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   Is that how this works.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.980]   James says no.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   You see.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   Not all profession.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:00.980]   Of faith.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.980]   Is saving faith.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.980]   James.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.980]   Logically.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   Explains.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   Be observable.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980]   He even summarized.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.980]   This by saying.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.980]   In chapter one.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   Verse 22.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.980]   That we must be.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   Doers of the word.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   And not hearers only.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.980]   And he continues.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   With this treaties.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.980]   And wrote in our present text.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:18.980]   That faith.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.980]   If it has no works.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.980]   Is dead.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.980]   And by works.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   What he means is.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.980]   He means righteous action.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   Or righteous behavior.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.980]   A behavior.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   Which obeys.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   The commandments.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.980]   Of our Lord.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.980]   Scripture tells us.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.980]   In Ephesians.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.980]   Chapter two.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.980]   Verse 10.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.980]   We are his.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.980]   Workmanship.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.980]   Created in Christ.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.980]   Jesus.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:38.980]   For.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:39.980]   Good works.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   Which God.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   Prepared beforehand.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   That we would walk.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   In them.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   You see.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.980]   God did not call us.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   And justify us.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   Freely by his son.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   Jesus.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.980]   So that we may continue.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.980]   To live.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.980]   As reprobates.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.980]   In this world.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   God.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   He called us.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   To daily.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.980]   Sanctification.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   So that we may.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.980]   Cleanse ourselves.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.980]   From all filthiness.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.980]   Of the flesh.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   And spirit.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   Perfecting holiness.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   In the fear.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.980]   Of our God.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.980]   And so.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   How we live.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.980]   Proves who we are.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.980]   If I am truly.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   In Christ Jesus.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.980]   I will present myself.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:11.980]   As a living sacrifice.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.980]   To the Lord.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.980]   In sanctification.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:14.980]   And honor.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.980]   But if I'm not.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   In Christ.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.980]   And I merely profess.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.980]   To believe who he is.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.980]   I will continue on.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.980]   Like the rest of the world.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:21.980]   Always learning.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   And never able.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   To come to the knowledge.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.980]   Of the truth.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   Professing to know God.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   With my mouth.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]   But denying him.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.980]   In my works.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.980]   And just so we are clear.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.980]   On this matter.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.980]   None of us are saved.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   By our works.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.980]   Scripture is very clear.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   And it tells us.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.980]   In Ephesians chapter 2.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.980]   Verse 8 and 9.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   That we are saved.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.980]   By grace.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.980]   Through faith.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.980]   And that not of ourselves.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   It is the gift of God.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   Not as a result of works.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.980]   So that no one may boast.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.980]   And the point is.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   If works.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.980]   Had any part.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   In our justification.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.980]   In which we are declared.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   Righteous.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.980]   Before a holy God.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   By faith in Christ.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   It will no longer.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.980]   Be grace.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   And if you're listening.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   To me this morning.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   You might be saying.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   This to yourself.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.980]   Well wait a minute.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.980]   That sounds.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   Like a contradiction.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.980]   The apostle Paul said.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.980]   That we are saved.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.980]   By grace.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   Through faith.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.980]   Where James says.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.980]   We are justified.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   By works.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   And not by faith.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   Alone.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.980]   What is going on here?
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.980]   Was James contradicting.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.980]   The teachings.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.980]   Of the apostle Paul.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   When he says.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.980]   Faith without works.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.980]   Is dead.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.980]   And the answer.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   To that question.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   Is no.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.980]   There is no contradiction.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   Here.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:32.980]   We are saved.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:33.980]   By grace.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:34.980]   Through faith.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.980]   And that is.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.980]   The truth.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:37.980]   But we also.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   Have to understand.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.980]   The doctrine.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   Of sanctification.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   That true.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.980]   Saving faith.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.980]   Is not alone.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.980]   For true.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   Saving faith.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.980]   Produces.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   Good works.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   Many of you.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   Might have heard.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   The argument.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   That fate.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   Is the root.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   Of our salvation.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   And works.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   Is the fruit.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.980]   Of our salvation.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   And this is true.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   We do not work.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:02.980]   Because we want.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.980]   To be saved.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.980]   We work.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   Because we are saved.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   You see.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   Paul and James.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.980]   They are not contradicting.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.980]   Each other.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   Rather.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   They are complimenting.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:12.980]   Each other.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   The apostle Paul.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.980]   Who fiercely.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.980]   Defended.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.980]   The doctrine.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   Of justification.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.980]   Also wrote.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.980]   In Titus.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.980]   Chapter 3.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   Verse 8.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.980]   Those who have believed.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.980]   God.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   Will be careful.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   To engage.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.980]   In good deeds.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.980]   And then he says.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.980]   These things are good.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.980]   And profitable.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.980]   For men.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:33.980]   And as I mentioned.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:34.980]   Earlier.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.980]   His audience.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.980]   Were mainly.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   Jewish Christians.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   And some.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   Jewish Christians.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   Had gone from.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   An extreme.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.980]   Legalistic.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   Judaism.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:43.980]   To an opposite.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   Extreme.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   Of antinomianism.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   Meaning.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.980]   Without law.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   Or against law.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   In other words.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.980]   They replaced.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.980]   The work.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.980]   Righteous system.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.980]   With another.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.980]   That required.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   No works.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.980]   At all.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   And as a result.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.980]   Their lives.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.980]   From the way.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:46:59.980]   They had formerly lived.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:00.980]   And we see.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   This behavior.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.980]   Being demonstrated.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   By many.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.980]   Christians.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   Today.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   Oh.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   Grace.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.980]   Grace.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.980]   I'm saved.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.980]   By grace.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   So don't.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   Preach.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.980]   Obedience.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   To me.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:15.980]   As if.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   Obedience.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.980]   Or legalistic.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.980]   They.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.980]   Misunderstand.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.980]   The freedom.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   That we have.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980]   In Christ.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980]   And go.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.980]   To the opposite.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.980]   Extreme.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.980]   To adultery.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.980]   Christian liberty.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.980]   They look.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.980]   Into the law.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.980]   Of liberty.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.980]   Which is the gospel.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.980]   Of our savior.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.980]   Only to go away.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   And immediately.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   Forget.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.980]   What they look like.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.980]   In other words.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   They make.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.980]   No correction.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.980]   In their life.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.980]   No correction.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.980]   In their behavior.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.980]   They say.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   Oh yes.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.980]   It's true.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.980]   But they never.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   Commit themselves.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   To the truth.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   Of the gospel.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   To demonstrate.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   Works of obedience.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.980]   In keeping.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.980]   With repentance.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.980]   And it's unfortunate.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   Because you can approach.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:58.980]   Some individuals.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   In the church.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Today.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.980]   And ask them.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]   Do you believe.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   In God.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.980]   And they would answer.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:05.980]   Yes.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.980]   Do you believe.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.980]   Lived and died.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:09.980]   And rose from the grave.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:10.980]   And they will say.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   Yes.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   Of course.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.980]   But then.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.980]   When you observe.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.980]   The Lord.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:16.980]   At all.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.980]   And I want to tell you.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.980]   This this morning.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.980]   If the fruit of the spirit.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   Is not present.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   In the life.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   Of an individual.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   Claiming to be a Christian.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980]   They do not know.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.980]   The Lord.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.980]   Jesus said.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   A good tree.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.980]   Does not bear.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.980]   Bad fruit.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980]   Nor does a bad tree.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.980]   Bear good fruit.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   For every tree.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:33.980]   Is known.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   By its fruit.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.980]   He also said.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980]   In the New Testament.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.980]   Why do you call me.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   Lord.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.980]   And not do what I say.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.980]   You know.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   Some individuals.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   May claim.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.980]   To have responded.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.980]   To an altar call.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.980]   And I say.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:47.980]   Great to that.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.980]   They said.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:49.980]   They said.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.980]   The sinners prayer.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.980]   Great.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:52.980]   They were baptized.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:52.980]   Great.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.980]   But my question.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:54.980]   To them is this.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.980]   How has your life.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   Changed since.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   Is it any different.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.980]   Are you producing.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.980]   The fruit of the spirit.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:01.980]   In your life.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.980]   Explaining good works.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.980]   Of obedience.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.980]   To our Lord.
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   Anyone can have.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.980]   An emotional experience.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   At a Christian event.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.980]   And they can respond.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.980]   With emotion.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:11.980]   To what is happening.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   Around them.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.980]   But true.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.980]   Saving faith.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   Is always accompanied.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.980]   By a transformed life.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.980]   That continues.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.980]   To produce.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:19.980]   Good works.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.980]   Because faith.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.980]   Without works.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.980]   Is dead.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.980]   And coming back.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:25.980]   To our text.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:26.980]   James explains.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:27.980]   What a dead faith.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:28.980]   Looks like.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:29.980]   And the first characteristic.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.980]   Of dead faith.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.980]   Without action.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.980]   Notice verse 14.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.980]   James says.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:36.980]   What use is it.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.980]   My brethren.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   If someone says.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:39.980]   He has faith.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   But he has no works.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   Can that faith.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   Save him.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.980]   You see.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.980]   It's easy.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.980]   For anyone.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:46.980]   To say.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:47.980]   I believe.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:48.980]   I have faith.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.980]   Anyone can say.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.980]   That they believe.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.980]   The gospel.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.980]   But the point.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:53.980]   That James is making.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.980]   Is this.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:55.980]   Confession of faith.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.980]   Is dead.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   Without action.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980]   And the answer.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.980]   To this.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   Is an obvious.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.980]   No.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.980]   Faith.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.980]   Without action.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.980]   Is an empty.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.980]   Confession.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.980]   With no evidence.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:07.980]   Of a change line.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.980]   I mean.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.980]   How can anyone.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.980]   Demonstrate.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.980]   A changed life.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.980]   Without the product.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.980]   Of faith.
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.980]   It's impossible.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:15.980]   If true.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.980]   Faith.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.980]   Is placed.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.980]   In Christ.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.980]   We're given.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:20.980]   We're given.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.980]   A new nature.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.980]   In Christ.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:23.980]   And that new nature.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.980]   Will naturally.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.980]   Manifest itself.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.980]   In good works.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.980]   And you know.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   James.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:29.980]   List some of those works.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.980]   That accompany.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.980]   Saving faith.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.980]   In this letter.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.980]   For example.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:34.980]   He mentions.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:35.980]   Endurance.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.980]   In chapter 1.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:37.980]   Verse 3.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:37.980]   Perseverance.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.980]   Under trial.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.980]   In chapter 1.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:40.980]   Verse 12.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.980]   Purity of life.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.980]   In chapter 1.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.980]   Verse 27.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.980]   Obedience to scripture.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   In chapter 1.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.980]   Verse 22.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.980]   And 23.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.980]   Compassion for the needy.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.980]   Impartiality.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.980]   Acts of compassion.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.980]   Control of the tongue.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.980]   Humility.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:54.980]   Truthfulness.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.980]   And patience.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.980]   And so the point.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:50:59.980]   That James was making.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:00.980]   Is this.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.980]   What good is it.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:02.980]   To confess.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:02.980]   You believe.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.980]   The word of truth.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.980]   Without any action.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.980]   If your life.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.980]   Is not demonstrated.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.980]   By endurance.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.980]   Perseverance.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.980]   Under trials.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   Purity of life.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:12.980]   Obedience to the scripture.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   Compassion for the needy.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.980]   What kind of a faith.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.980]   Is that.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.980]   It is an inactive faith.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   A faith.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.980]   Which does not save.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.980]   Salvation involves.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.980]   New birth.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.980]   Salvation.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.980]   Is a transformation.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.980]   From the old.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.980]   To the new.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.980]   And if salvation.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.980]   Is a new birth.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.980]   Then it must be.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:34.980]   Demonstrated.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:35.980]   By itself.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:36.980]   In the behavior.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.980]   Consistent.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.980]   With that new nature.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.980]   And it makes sense.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.980]   That if I'm a new person.
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:41.980]   There'll be new factors.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.980]   How I conduct myself.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.980]   Right.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.980]   As most of you know.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.980]   I am a former rebel.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.980]   Saved by God's mercy.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.980]   But you know.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.980]   That statement means.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.980]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.980]   If I continue to.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:55.980]   Walk like a thug.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.980]   Talk like a thug.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.980]   And act like a thug.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.980]   In fact.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.980]   I won't even be here.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.980]   I won't even be here.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.980]   If I continue.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.980]   To yield myself.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.980]   To the desires.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:07.980]   Of my fallen flesh.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:08.980]   And bear.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:09.980]   It's ugly fruit.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.980]   You know who I am.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.980]   I am a liar.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.980]   And the truth.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.980]   Is no longer in me.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   Scripture.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   Tells us.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   In first John.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.980]   Chapter three.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:21.980]   Verse nine.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.980]   No one who is born of God.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.980]   Practices sin.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   Because his seed.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   Abides in him.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:27.980]   And he cannot sin.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.980]   Because he is born of God.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   When true regeneration.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.980]   Takes place.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.980]   And the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.980]   Transforms a person.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:35.980]   From sinner.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:36.980]   To saint.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.980]   God creates.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.980]   In the soul.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.980]   Of that person.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:40.980]   A new desire.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   To forsake.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   Sin.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.980]   And self.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.980]   So that he will gladly.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.980]   Serve the Lord.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.980]   Jesus Christ.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.980]   And obey.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:48.980]   His divine standard.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.980]   Of righteousness.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.980]   For example.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.980]   When Zacchaeus.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   Believed in Jesus.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980]   He said.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:54.980]   Look Lord.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:55.980]   I give half of my good.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.980]   To the poor.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.980]   And if I have taken.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   Anything from anyone.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.980]   By false accusation.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.980]   I restore.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:00.980]   Fourfold.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   Life.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.980]   Also.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   When at Ephesus.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   When the Ephesians.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.980]   Trusted in Christ.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.980]   And they were.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.980]   Confessing.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.980]   And telling of their sins.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.980]   Many of those.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.980]   Who practiced magic.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.980]   You know what they did?
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.980]   They brought their books together.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.980]   And they burned them all.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.980]   On the side of everyone.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.980]   You see.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.980]   Following their conversion.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.980]   To Christ.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:19.980]   They.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.980]   These believers.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:21.980]   Knew.
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:22.980]   That occult practices.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   Were evil.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   And it had no place.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   In their Christian life.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.980]   In first.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.980]   Thessalonians.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:29.980]   Chapter one.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980]   Verse nine.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.980]   Wrote that the believers.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.980]   In Thessalonica.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:33.980]   Had turned to God.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:34.980]   From idols.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.980]   To serve the living.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.980]   And true God.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.980]   That is a transformed life.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.980]   That is a renewed.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:40.980]   Heart.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.980]   That desires God.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.980]   And God alone.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.980]   If you're born again.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:46.980]   If you're born again.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:46.980]   By the spirit of God.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.980]   You have received.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.980]   A new nature.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.980]   With a new disposition.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.980]   Toward God.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   And because.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.980]   You have a new nature.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.980]   In Christ.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:55.980]   You will progressively.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.980]   Abandon.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:57.980]   The former things.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:58.980]   That was displeasing.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.980]   To God.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   And you will now.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   Forever.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:01.980]   Produce works.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.980]   Of righteousness.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:03.980]   Salvation.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.980]   Does not produce.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:06.980]   Immediate perfection.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.980]   And I want to make that clear.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.980]   But it does give us.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:11.980]   A new direction.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.980]   And the new disposition.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:15.980]   That hates sin.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:16.980]   Loves the Lord.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.980]   And seeks to know him.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.980]   And obey him.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   Begins to manifest itself.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:20.980]   In our actions.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.980]   And so the first characteristics.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.980]   Of dead faith.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   Is a faith.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:25.980]   Without action.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.980]   Secondly.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:27.980]   Dead faith.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.980]   Is identified.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:29.980]   In absence.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.980]   Of charity.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.980]   Notice again.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.980]   Verses 15.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.980]   And 17.
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.980]   If a brother.
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.980]   Or sister.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   Is without clothing.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:36.980]   And in need.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   Of daily food.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   And one of you.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   Says to them.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   Go in peace.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:40.980]   Be warmed.
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.980]   And be filled.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:41.980]   And yet.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:42.980]   You do not give them.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.980]   What is necessary.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.980]   For their body.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.980]   What use is that?
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.980]   Even so.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:48.980]   Faith.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.980]   If it has no works.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:50.980]   Is dead.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.980]   Being by itself.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:55.980]   James.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.980]   Makes a point.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.980]   By comparing.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.980]   Faith.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:59.980]   Without works.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.980]   To words.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:01.980]   Of charity.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   Without the works.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   Of charity.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   And so.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.980]   In this scenario.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:05.980]   We see.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.980]   A poor brother.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:07.980]   Or sister.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:08.980]   Who is without clothing.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.980]   And without daily food.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:10.980]   And I want you to notice.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.980]   In the text.
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:12.980]   That the insufficiently clothed.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   And destitute person.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   Isn't some stranger.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.980]   That randomly walked.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:16.980]   Into the church.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.980]   But it's a brother.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   Or sister.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.980]   In other words.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   They belong.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:21.980]   To the household of God.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   They are members.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.980]   Of the local church.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   As members.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.980]   As members.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.980]   Of this church.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.980]   They are Christians.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   And because.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.980]   It was common.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:30.980]   In the early church.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.980]   To have poor.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.980]   Brothers and sisters.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:33.980]   Who lacked.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.980]   The basic necessities.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.980]   Even the apostle.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   John.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.980]   Has something.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.980]   To say.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.980]   About this.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.980]   In first.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.980]   John.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   Chapter 3.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.980]   Verse 17.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   But whoever has the world's goods.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.980]   And sees his brother.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.980]   In need.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:48.980]   And closes his heart.
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.980]   Against him.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.980]   How does the love of God.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   Abide in him.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   Little children.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   Let us not love.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   With word.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:55.980]   Or with tongue.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.980]   But in deed.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:57.980]   And in truth.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.980]   And so here.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:02.980]   Is a brother or sister.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.980]   Cold and hungry.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.980]   The rest of the congregation.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:06.980]   See them in their church.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.980]   They see their condition.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   They know that.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.980]   They're insufficiently clothed.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   They know that.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:13.980]   They're destitute.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.980]   Of daily food.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.980]   But they say to them.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.980]   Go in peace.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.980]   Be warmed and filled.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   And they do this.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:20.980]   Without giving them.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   Any aid.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.980]   James says.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:25.980]   This is an attitude.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:26.980]   Of total disregard.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.980]   For those.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.980]   Who are in need.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.980]   To the point.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.980]   Of absurdity.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.980]   This doesn't make.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:32.980]   Any sense.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.980]   You're telling.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.980]   A brother or sister.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   Who is insufficiently clothed.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   And he is destitute.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.980]   Of daily food.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.980]   Go in peace.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:40.980]   Be warmed.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.980]   And be filled.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:42.980]   As if that brother.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.980]   Or sister.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   Would not have done so.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:45.980]   If they were able.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.980]   And the point.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.980]   That James is making.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:51.980]   Is that just like.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   Faith without works.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.980]   Is dead.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.980]   So words of charity.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.980]   Like go in peace.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.980]   Be warmed.
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   And be filled.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.980]   Is worthless.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.980]   Without its actions.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:00.980]   It's worthless.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   Without its works.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.980]   At the end of verse 16.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:04.980]   James says.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.980]   If you do not give them.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:06.980]   What is necessary.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   For their body.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.980]   What use is that?
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.980]   In other words.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   What good.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:12.980]   Does that kind of faith.
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:13.980]   Serve.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   Let's.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   You confess.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:16.980]   To believe in God.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:17.980]   A loving.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:18.980]   Merciful.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:19.980]   And compassionate.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.980]   God.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:21.980]   But you don't have.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.980]   Any concern.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:23.980]   For those.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:24.980]   Who are in need.
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:25.980]   Within your own congregation.
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   What faith is that?
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.980]   James says.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:29.980]   In verse 17.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:30.980]   It is a dead faith.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.980]   We read in Galatians.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.980]   Chapter 6.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.980]   Verse 10.
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   While we have opportunity.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   Let us.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   Good.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Let us do good.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   To all people.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.980]   And then notice.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.980]   What he says.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   In the following.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.980]   And especially.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:47.980]   To those.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   Who are the house.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.980]   Of the faith.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:50.980]   Especially.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.980]   To those.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   Who are.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:53.980]   Christians.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:54.980]   In Matthew.
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.980]   Chapter 25.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.980]   Jesus taught us.
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:57.980]   To have a special obligation.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:58.980]   To help.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.980]   Fellow believers.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.980]   Jesus.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:01.980]   And that is indicated.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   By the word.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:03.980]   My brethren.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.980]   In the passage.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:05.980]   Jesus said.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.980]   In Matthew.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:07.980]   Chapter 25.
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:07.980]   Beginning.
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.980]   In verse 31.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.980]   When the son of man.
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.980]   Comes in his glory.
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:12.980]   And all the holy angels.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:13.980]   With him.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.980]   Then he will sit.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:15.980]   On the throne.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:16.980]   Of his glory.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   And all the nations.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:18.980]   Will be gathered.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:18.980]   Before him.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:19.980]   And he will separate them.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.980]   One.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.980]   From another.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:22.980]   As a shepherd.
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.980]   Divides his sheep.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   From the goats.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   And he will set the sheep.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:26.980]   On his right hand.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   But the goats.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:28.980]   On the left.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.980]   We are all going to be.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:30.980]   Partakers of this.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.980]   We are all going to be there.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.980]   Verse 34.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.980]   Then the king.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:36.980]   Will say to those.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   On his right hand.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:37.980]   Come.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.980]   You blessed of my father.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.980]   Inherit the kingdom.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:40.980]   Prepared for you.
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.980]   From the foundation.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.980]   Of the world.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.980]   For I was hungry.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   And you gave me food.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:45.980]   I was thirsty.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.980]   You gave me drink.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   I was a stranger.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   You took me in.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:50.980]   I was naked.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:51.980]   And you clothed me.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.980]   I was sick.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   And you visited me.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   I was in prison.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.980]   And you came to me.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.980]   Then verse 37.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:58.980]   Then the righteous.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:58:59.980]   Will answer him saying.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:58:59.980]   Lord.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.980]   When do we see you hungry.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   And feed you.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:02.980]   Or thirsty.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:03.980]   And give you drink.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.980]   When do we see you.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:05.980]   A stranger.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.980]   And take you in.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.980]   Or naked.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   And clothe you.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   Or when do we see you.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.980]   Sick.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.980]   Or in prison.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.980]   And come to you.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:13.980]   Say to them.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   Surely I say to you.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.980]   In as much as you did it.
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.980]   To one of the least of these.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:18.980]   My brethren.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:19.980]   You did it to me.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.980]   You see.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   Works of compassion.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.980]   Toward fellow Christians.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:25.980]   Is an act of obedience.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   And service to Christ.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.980]   But to ignore the needs.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   Of fellow Christians.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   Is an act of disobedience.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   To the law.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:33.980]   The royal law.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:34.980]   Which commands us.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.980]   To love one another.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.980]   But I do want to be clear here.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.980]   I want to qualify this.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   Because this does not mean.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.980]   That the church.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   Should be responsible.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.980]   To care for everyone.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   Without discernment.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.980]   You see.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   We don't just give aid.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.980]   To any individual.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   Who visit our church.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   And says.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.980]   I'm a Christian.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.980]   And I need money.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.980]   We have to understand.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.980]   That the church.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   Is not a social welfare system.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   If an individual.
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.980]   Is capable of work.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980]   If they're capable of work.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980]   But they refuse to work.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.980]   Because of idleness.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.980]   Or laziness.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   And they lack the means.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   To provide for themselves.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980]   As a result of that.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.980]   The church.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.980]   Is not responsible.
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:12.980]   To aid such an individual.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.980]   Now.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.980]   If you feel compelled.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   To be generous.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.980]   You may help that individual.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.980]   But it's not a must.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980]   For scripture.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:21.980]   Is very clear.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.980]   If anyone is not willing.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.980]   To work.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.980]   He is not to eat.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.980]   And they're commanded.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.980]   To work in quiet fashion.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.980]   And eat their own bread.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   However.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   We must assist.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.980]   Our brothers and sisters.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Who has a reputation.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:37.980]   Of good works.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.980]   And an unwavering devotion.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   To the Lord.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   You see.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.980]   When a brother or sister.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   Fall into hard times.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.980]   Despite their very best efforts.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:46.980]   To find a job.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.980]   We who are able.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   Should come to their aid.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.980]   If a brother or sister.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   Fall into poverty.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.980]   As a result of calamity.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.980]   Or a result of oppression.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:58.980]   Or a result of oppression.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.980]   We must come to their aid.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.980]   We must come to their aid.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.980]   We must not use words of compassion.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   Flippantly.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980]   And saying to our brothers in need.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.980]   You know what?
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:08.980]   I'll pray for you.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.980]   Go in peace.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   When we do that.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:13.980]   When we do that.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.980]   We are.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.980]   We're just using.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.980]   Words of charity.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   Without the works.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.980]   We're sending them away.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.980]   Without giving them.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.980]   What is necessary.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.980]   And so.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   Our words of charity.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:27.980]   Must parallel.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:28.980]   The works of charity.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.980]   We must not just love.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   With word.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980]   But with deed.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   And in truth.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   And finally.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980]   Dead faith is identified.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.980]   By shallow conviction.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.980]   Notice with me.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   Verses 18 and 20.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   But someone may well say.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   You have faith.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.980]   And I have works.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:48.980]   Show me your faith.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   Without the works.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.980]   And I will show you my faith.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.980]   By my works.
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.980]   You believe that God is one.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   You do well.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.980]   The demons also believe.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   And shudder.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980]   But are you willing to recognize.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.980]   You foolish fellow.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   That faith without works.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.980]   Is useless.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.980]   Now here's the point.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.980]   Of this illustration.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:06.980]   For argument's sake.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:07.980]   Let's say an individual.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.980]   Professes to have faith.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.980]   Which is independent.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.980]   From his works.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.980]   How do you know.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.980]   That his faith is genuine.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.980]   There's no way of telling.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   I know most of you.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.980]   Will ask me to prove myself.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.980]   If I made a claim.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.980]   That I can do a cartwheel.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:24.980]   And a triple backflip.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.980]   Right.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.980]   First service.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.980]   Everyone was laughing at me.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.980]   Because they know.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.980]   I can't do it.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.980]   Right.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.980]   But you would ask me.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.980]   Prove yourself.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.980]   You made this claim.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980]   I want you to prove yourself.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   And that is because.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.980]   You want me to back up my claim.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.980]   With the proof of action.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   And so James make a.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   Makes a clear.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   And logical argument.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.980]   That we can't see.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:49.980]   Someone's faith.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.980]   faith.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   But you know what we can see.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.980]   We can see their works.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.980]   Remember the words of Jesus.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:56.980]   Who said.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.980]   You will know them by their fruit.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.980]   He did not say.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.980]   You will know them by their words.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.980]   You will know them by their fruit.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.980]   You will know them by their action.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   And so anyone claiming to possess.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.980]   Faith without works.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.980]   Is committing a fallacy.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.980]   True saving faith.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   Can never stand alone.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.980]   Genuine faith.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   Is always occupied with works.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.980]   James says in verse 17.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   Faith by itself.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.980]   If it has no works.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980]   Is dead.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.980]   Faith without works.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.980]   Is not faith.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.980]   And it is certainly not saving faith.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.980]   I stated before.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:39.980]   Genuine faith.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   Will produce good works.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.980]   Because that is the nature.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.980]   And purpose of it.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.980]   Anyone can say that they're serious.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:48.980]   About their faith.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   But again.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   How will they prove it?
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.980]   What's the litmus test for faith?
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.980]   How does one measure.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.980]   The seriousness.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980]   Of their commitment to the Lord?
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.980]   You see.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   It would be absolutely impossible.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.980]   To demonstrate saving faith.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.980]   Without its works.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.980]   As the saying goes.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.980]   And we all know this.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   Right?
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.980]   Talk is cheap.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.980]   Actions speak louder than words.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.980]   James says.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.980]   Show it to me.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.980]   I want to see it.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.980]   And if there is no works.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.980]   If there is no fruit of righteousness.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.980]   There is no way.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980]   To demonstrate the legitimacy.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.980]   Of that faith.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.980]   But on the other hand.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.980]   James says.
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.980]   I will show you my faith.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:30.980]   By my works.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.980]   If we profess to have saving faith.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.980]   In Christ Jesus.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.980]   It must be a faith.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.980]   That works.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.980]   You see.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:40.980]   True faith.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.980]   Does not merely hear the word.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.980]   But does the word.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.980]   The word.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.980]   And so.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.980]   The reality.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   Of our faith in Christ.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.980]   Must be demonstrated.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   By works.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.980]   Then James says.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.980]   In verse 19.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980]   If you notice.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980]   You believe.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980]   That God is one.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980]   You do well.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.980]   The demons.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980]   Also believe.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.980]   In shutter.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.980]   And I remember.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.980]   Reading this passage.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.980]   For the first time.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:04.980]   Is very interesting.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.980]   Because.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   Did you know.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   That demons.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980]   Are not atheists.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980]   They're not even.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.980]   Agnostics.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.980]   They believe.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.980]   In God.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.980]   They believe.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.980]   In the one.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980]   True God.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.980]   But.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.980]   Did you know.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.980]   That the fallacy.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.980]   Of faith.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.980]   Without works.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.980]   Is also.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.980]   Demonstrated.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.980]   They believe.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.980]   God.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.980]   And what is.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   Interesting.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:27.980]   Is that.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980]   Even their.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   Theology.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   Is correct.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.980]   Because.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.980]   They believe.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:33.980]   God.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   Is one.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   They also.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.980]   Believe.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   In the deity.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.980]   Of Christ.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.980]   There is.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.980]   No challenge.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.980]   There.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.980]   Remember.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980]   When Jesus.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.980]   Encountered.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.980]   Demons.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.980]   During his.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:46.980]   Earthly.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:47.980]   Ministry.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   They testified.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.980]   That Jesus.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.980]   Is who.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   The son.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.980]   God.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:53.980]   And yes.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:54.980]   If you would like.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.980]   To argue.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.980]   They even know.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.980]   The scriptures.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.980]   Probably better.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:05:59.980]   Than most.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980]   Christians.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980]   Today.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.980]   They believe.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980]   Everything.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   About God.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980]   And they.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980]   Shutter.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980]   But the question.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.980]   Is.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.980]   Are demons.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:10.980]   Saved.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.980]   No.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.980]   Demons.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:13.980]   Believe.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.980]   And acknowledge.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.980]   God.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.980]   But their belief.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:17.980]   And acknowledgement.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.980]   Of God.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.980]   Does nothing.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.980]   For them.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980]   In a similar way.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:22.980]   An individual.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.980]   Can be enlightened.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   In his mind.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.980]   With the word.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980]   Of truth.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.980]   They can be orthodox.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980]   In what they know.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980]   For example.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.980]   They could agree.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:31.980]   That there is.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980]   One God.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.980]   In Trinity.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:34.980]   That Jesus.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980]   Is the son of God.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.980]   That salvation.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.980]   Is by grace.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.980]   Through faith.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.980]   That Jesus died.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:40.980]   On a Roman cross.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.980]   That he was buried.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.980]   And he rose back.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.980]   To life.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.980]   On the third day.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.980]   Ascending back.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:46.980]   But knowing.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.980]   All of this.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   They could still be lost.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   Knowing all the truth.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.980]   Knowing.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   And be orthodox.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   They could still be lost.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.980]   And this is because.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.980]   True saving faith.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   Involves something.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.980]   More than just.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:02.980]   Knowing about the truth.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.980]   It's more than just.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:04.980]   Agreeing with the truth.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.980]   True saving faith.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   Involves something.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.980]   That can be seen.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:10.980]   And recognized.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.980]   Transformed life.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   Again.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.980]   Quoting verse 18.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.980]   Show me your faith.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.980]   Without your works.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:18.980]   And I will show you.
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.980]   My faith.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.980]   By my works.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980]   Then we move on.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.980]   To verse 20.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.980]   James says.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.980]   Are you willing.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.980]   To recognize.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.980]   You foolish fellow.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.980]   That faith.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   Without works.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]   Is useless.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.980]   And here.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.980]   James prepares us.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.980]   For a history lesson.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.980]   From the Old Testament.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.980]   To demonstrate.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.980]   That genuine faith.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.980]   Is always.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:41.980]   Accompanied.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.980]   By works.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.980]   And James.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]   Uses.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980]   Two accounts.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.980]   From the Old Testament.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.980]   To prove.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980]   His point.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:49.980]   That genuine faith.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.980]   Is demonstrated.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.980]   By works.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.980]   Of obedience.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.980]   And I'm going to give.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.980]   Attention.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]   To just one of those.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980]   Which is the account.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980]   Of Abraham.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:58.980]   Beginning.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.980]   In verse 21.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   So if you notice.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.980]   In verse 21.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.980]   Here.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   James gives us.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980]   A brief history lesson.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   He said.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.980]   Was not Abraham.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.980]   Our father.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.980]   Justified by works.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.980]   You see.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:09.980]   That faith.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.980]   Was working.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.980]   With his works.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:12.980]   And as a result.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:13.980]   Of the works.
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.980]   Faith.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.980]   Was perfected.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.980]   And the scripture.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:17.980]   Was fulfilled.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.980]   Which says.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.980]   Abraham believed God.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:20.980]   And it was reckoned to him.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.980]   As righteousness.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.980]   And he was called.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.980]   The friend of God.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   You see.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   That a man.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.980]   Is justified.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.980]   By works.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.980]   Faith alone.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   Faith alone.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.980]   Now James.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   Is not contradicting.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.980]   The doctrines.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   Of justification.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:34.980]   By faith.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:35.980]   Again.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:36.980]   We have to understand.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:36.980]   That James.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.980]   Is not dealing.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   With the means.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   Of salvation.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980]   But rather.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.980]   The outcome.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.980]   Of salvation.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   James's argument.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   Is that.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   If you claim.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:44.980]   To have faith.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:45.980]   In Christ Jesus.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   If you truly.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   Experience.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.980]   The love of God.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:48.980]   Through Christ Jesus.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.980]   And know.
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.980]   That he is good.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   Your faith.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.980]   Will demonstrate.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   Works of obedience.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   Outwardly.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.980]   And just as our faith.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:58.980]   Is tested.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.980]   For genuineness.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:00.980]   So was the faith.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.980]   Of Abraham.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.980]   And that's the point.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.980]   That James.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   Is making here.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.980]   Abraham's faith.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:06.980]   Was publicly.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.980]   Displayed.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.980]   When he offered.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   His son.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980]   Isaac.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.980]   On the altar.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:12.980]   You see.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.980]   The reality.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:14.980]   Of Abraham's faith.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:15.980]   In God.
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.980]   Was declared.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.980]   By his actions.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.980]   And I want us.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.980]   To understand.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:20.980]   Abraham.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   He was not.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:22.980]   A perfect man.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:23.980]   And the scripture.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   Does not say.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.980]   That Abraham.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.980]   Was a perfect man.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.980]   But you know.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:28.980]   Who he was.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.980]   He was a man.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.980]   Who trusted God.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   And you know.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:32.980]   The reality.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   Of his faith.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   In God.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   Was demonstrated.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   On that day.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   When God.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:38.980]   Told Abraham.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.980]   To offer.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.980]   His only.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:41.980]   Beloved son.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:42.980]   As a burnt.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.980]   Offering.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:44.980]   And can you think.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:44.980]   Of.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.980]   A test of faith.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.980]   More severe.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:46.980]   In degree.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:46.980]   Than the one.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:46.980]   That Abraham.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.980]   Was willing.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:48.980]   To go through.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.980]   Through.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:49.980]   But you see.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:50.980]   Abraham.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.980]   Was willing.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.980]   To go through.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:53.980]   With it.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980]   You know.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.980]   Why?
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.980]   Because he trusted.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:57.980]   God.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.980]   Abraham stood firm.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.980]   In the promise.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.980]   Of God.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   That God.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.980]   Will multiply.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.980]   His descendants.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.980]   Through his son.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:11.880]   by faith before God, but he was justified not simply by agreeing with God, but by his works of
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:20.800]   obedience. And that's the point. That is the point that James is making. Faith was coupled together
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:31.320]   with works, and by works, faith was made perfected. Jesus said, every tree that does not bear fruit is
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:40.540]   cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them. And we're all smart
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:47.720]   people here, but bearing fruit is an integral part of a tree. That's what it was designed to do.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.540]   And you know, even before a seed is planted into the soil, it contains all the genetic information
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:11:00.940]   that it needs to produce its own kind of fruit. And in the same way, when an individual is regenerated
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:07.080]   by the Spirit of God, given new life in Christ by the Holy Spirit, he has given a new nature by God.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.060]   And that individual is given all the spiritual genetics to produce works of obedience.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:21.820]   And that is the sense in which faith is perfected. It produces fruit for which it was designed.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:27.100]   And so just as a fruit tree has not fulfilled its purpose until it bears fruit,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:33.620]   so also faith has not been perfected until it demonstrates itself in works of obedience to God.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:38.980]   And that is the sense in which Abraham was justified by works.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:45.140]   His willingness to sacrifice Isaac was that works by which his justification by faith
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.120]   was demonstrated and made manifest before men.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:55.440]   And because of his faith, notice at the end of verse 23,
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.400]   James says, Abraham was called a friend of God.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:06.780]   You know, the great privilege of the faithful is to be called a friend of God.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.160]   Many of us want to be friends with God.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.540]   And you know, we can all agree that friendship is important because friendship,
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.880]   it actually enriches our lives in so many ways, right?
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.820]   All of you who have friends, you will agree with me.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.360]   When you have friends, it prevents isolation and loneliness.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.480]   When you have friends, it actually increases our sense of belonging and purpose in this world.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:38.000]   And you know, friends, they keep each other accountable and we comfort one another through life's many challenges.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.800]   And I want you to think of all the times that you rejoice with those who rejoice and you mourn with those who mourn.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.900]   That is friendship.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:52.860]   But you know, adding to our existing and wonderful friendship that we have with one another,
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.420]   we have a divine friend who loves us,
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.100]   who willingly laid down his life for us to save us.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:05.500]   But for those who are seeking friendship with the Lord, you might be asking the question,
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.960]   well, how can we know that we are friends of Jesus?
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.940]   Jesus said in John chapter 15, verse 14,
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.600]   you are my friends if you do whatever I command you.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.720]   How do I know I'm a friend of Jesus?
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:26.060]   By my obedience to his commands.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:31.840]   Friendship with God is reserved for people who obey him.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.240]   A friend of God obeys God.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.160]   A friend of God imitates God.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.560]   And we know an individual is a friend of God by the way he lives his life.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.620]   And so if you profess to believe, but have no works, the word of God tells us you have a dead faith.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:58.640]   Not an incapable faith, not a disabled faith, but necros, it's dead.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.160]   It's a dead faith.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:07.760]   James says, faith without works is like a body without a spirit in verse 26.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.460]   And what is a body without its spirit?
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.260]   It's a corpse.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:14.280]   It's a corpse.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.320]   It's dead.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.320]   It's dead.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.940]   In the same way, faith without works is dead.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:29.760]   And so I pray, brothers and sisters here this morning, that our confession of faith does not lack action.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.360]   I pray that our words of charity will always be followed by the works of charity.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:46.440]   And I pray that our knowledge of Jesus Christ moves beyond an intellectual ascent, moves beyond just saying, I know, I know.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:54.480]   But it moves beyond that to true godly conviction, so that we may have life in his name.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   I pray for all of us here this morning that we possess true saving faith that works.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.340]   That our faith is demonstrated by works for the glory of our God.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.760]   Let's say a word of prayer.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.660]   Father, again, thank you for this time.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:23.020]   And just as you had reminded us in your inspired scripture, I pray that we will not just be hearers of the word, but doers.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:33.180]   If we truly had experienced your grace and mercy by your son, Jesus Christ, I pray that you will remind us of the transformed life we have.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:36.840]   For you, I stated that we are new creations in Christ.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.160]   Old things have passed away.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.660]   Behold, all things become new.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:45.640]   And I pray that we will continuously live in the newness of life to bring you honor and praise.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.820]   That you so deserve.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:49.840]   And so, Lord, thank you again for the time here.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.020]   Again, I pray for my brothers and sisters that they're not just hearers, but doers.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.360]   And I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.140]   Amen.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.400]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:00.420]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.200]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.600]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.060]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.020]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.220]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.120]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120]   Let us all rise for our close peace.
