[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:24.260]   - All right, welcome to Brink Community Church.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.540]   Let me get to a few announcements.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.940]   First of all, as you can see,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.220]   we have communion service today,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.580]   so please continue to prepare your heart for that.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.020]   All church praise and prayer
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.900]   is happening this week on Friday.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.780]   The foundation Bible study is still happening on Wednesday,
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.940]   but on Friday, we have praise and prayer at 7.30,
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.020]   so please come a little bit early
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.380]   so that we can get started right at 7.30.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.580]   Along with that, I made some announcements
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.980]   about our parking situation.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.020]   Our lot G is gonna be closed down for the time being,
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.220]   both on the weekend on Sunday,
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.660]   so some of you guys may have parked there,
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.960]   but also on the weekday.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.300]   We're gonna be shuttling to lot J,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.700]   so our sister Susan was able to, again,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.980]   get permission to park there.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.920]   So lot J, again, is where all the big parking is.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.340]   There's over 300 and some parking spaces there,
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.100]   so make sure you park to the left side of the parking lot,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.260]   and that's where our shuttles are gonna be.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.980]   And so lot G, unless we get further notice,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.860]   is gonna be shut down.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.620]   So lot H, which is the lot right next to G,
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.980]   there will be a shuttle that is going there.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.540]   It's gonna take a little bit longer than normal,
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.780]   but the majority of the shuttles,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.060]   if you want a quick pickup,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.620]   make sure you go to lot J, starting today, actually.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.980]   And then Kimco is shut down until further notice, okay?
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.900]   July 12th at 9 a.m. on Saturday,
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.500]   there is a cleaning and maintenance day,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.220]   so please sign up if you're able to come
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.740]   and help us out with that.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.380]   And then lastly, Brion Women's Softball Fellowship
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.140]   is happening today at Veterans Sports Park
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.660]   in Tustin at 2.30, so if you're playing,
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.820]   or if you're just going to support them and to watch them,
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.740]   please be there before 2.30,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.660]   and they're gonna get started today, okay?
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.220]   All right, let me pray for us
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.340]   and give you an opportunity to give.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.900]   And again, if you are visiting us
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.700]   and you have a physical offering,
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.020]   our offering box is in the back on the way out,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.420]   you'll see it on the wall, okay?
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.260]   Let's pray.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.500]   Father, we thank you for all the gifts that you've given us,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.700]   both the things that we are aware of,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.180]   and many things, Lord God, that you are orchestrating
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.340]   that we may not be aware of.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.580]   I pray that you would remind us again and again and again
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.820]   of what it is that we have in you
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.040]   so that our worship may simply be a reasonable response.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.300]   We pray that your name may be honored and glorified.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.700]   We pray that our communion table would sanctify us,
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.100]   sustain us, and strengthen us.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.580]   And even in this giving, I pray, Father God,
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.100]   that you would multiply it 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.020]   for the sake of your kingdom and for the gospel ministry.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:17:50.220 --> 00:18:00.620]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:08.540]   - If you can turn your Bible with me to Luke chapter 11,
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.840]   I'll be reading from verse 33.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.140]   Okay, Luke chapter 11, verse 33 to 36.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.900]   (pages rustling)
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:25.620]   No one after, oh, sorry.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:35.420]   No one after lighting a lamp puts it away in a cellar
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   nor under a basket but on the lampstand
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.380]   so that those who enter may see the light.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.840]   The eye is a lamp of your body.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.100]   When your eye is clear,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.960]   your whole body also is full of light
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.460]   but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.180]   Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.660]   If therefore your whole body is full of light
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.820]   with no dark part in it, it will wholly be illumined
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.760]   as when the light illumines you with its rays.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.600]   Let's pray.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.860]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.660]   We pray, Father God, that we may know your will
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.140]   and your heart, Father God, in this text.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.220]   I pray that you would help us not to turn from it
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.580]   to the left or to the right,
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.540]   that we would not add to it or to subtract from it,
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.500]   that it would be your very voice,
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.660]   your very breath, Lord God, that we hear.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.580]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.620]   Some of you guys who may have attended
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.780]   the Foundations of Marriage Seminar this week,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.620]   the topic of it was biblical communication.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.080]   And in the biblical communication,
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.360]   we spent bulk of our time talking about
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.620]   being a good listener.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.380]   And in listening, we need to be able to know
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.660]   who it is that we are talking to.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.540]   So whether I give a sermon or whether you're giving a talk
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.740]   or whether you're a school teacher,
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.420]   you have to know your audience
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.140]   before you're able to speak clearly.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.740]   You're not gonna speak the same way
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.700]   to a child versus an older person
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.580]   or somebody who is hurting versus somebody who is rejoicing.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.380]   And so if you don't know your audience,
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.060]   the very words that are being said,
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.760]   you're not gonna fully understand.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   And that is true when we understand the Bible.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.020]   We need to know who is speaking and who he's speaking to.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.920]   The text that we're looking at
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.200]   is a text that the content of it is very familiar to us,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.260]   that you are the light of the world,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.380]   that you don't light a lamp
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.000]   and then you put it under a cellar or you put it under a table,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.300]   you put it on top of it so that it can illumine the darkness.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.380]   We have songs about it.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.980]   You probably memorized this text when you were young.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.260]   But the context of this, who he's talking to,
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.300]   is gonna help us to be able to understand fully
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.240]   what it is that he's trying to say.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.580]   The content of what he says about being the light
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.180]   and putting it on a table, not underneath the table,
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.780]   is said in all four Gospels.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.940]   First place we see it is in Matthew 5:14,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.580]   is at the Sermon of the Mount.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.780]   And he's describing what people of God
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.020]   look like in the kingdom of God.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.400]   And so chapter five, six, and seven,
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.700]   in the context of that, he gives many descriptions
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.120]   of what the kingdom of God is like,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.660]   and he says you are the light of the world.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.160]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.140]   Also in Mark 4:21, he is talking,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.360]   but in this context, he is talking at the Sea of Galilee.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.480]   And he is describing to the crowd
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.900]   who have gathered together, they're not necessarily hostile,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.920]   they just wanna hear from him and learn from him.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.180]   And he tells them, again,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.500]   that you are the light of the world,
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.620]   you don't hide the light under the table.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:44.620]   That same text in Mark 4:21 is repeated in Luke 8:16.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.060]   The context is the same, the previous passage is the same,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.960]   and so what he is saying, he's addressing the same crowd
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.860]   at the Sea of Galilee.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   So again, Mark 4:21 and Luke 8:16 are parallel passages.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.220]   Matthew 5:14 is different because he's preaching this
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.540]   at the Sermon of the Mount, even though the content,
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.420]   majority of the content may be the same.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.700]   Luke chapter 11, the text that we're looking at
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.380]   is different from Matthew 5:14 and Luke 8:16.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.700]   Clearly, it's not the same as Luke 8:16
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.560]   because he already mentioned it in Luke.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.100]   And he's mentioning it again in Luke 11.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.600]   Now, why is this important?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.300]   Because the crowd that he is addressing
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.440]   is the same crowd who was accusing him,
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.460]   some of them accusing him of being demonic.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.340]   A large crowd was gathering to him,
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.220]   saying he's doing all of his miracles,
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.420]   casting out demons with the power of other demons,
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.820]   and Jesus is addressing that.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.940]   And then the second crowd of people who were skeptical
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.940]   of him was asking him, "Prove yourself, give us more sign."
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.700]   So if you remember in the previous passage in verse 29,
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.340]   it says, "As the crowds were increasing, he began to say,
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.860]   "This generation is a wicked generation.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.100]   "It seeks for a sign, but no more sign will be given."
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.780]   So he's addressing the same crowd.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.020]   He's not, all of a sudden, turning his head
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.740]   and addressing a different crowd,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.500]   or he's addressing the same crowd and all of a sudden,
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.740]   you know, I got something I gotta address
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.540]   and get this off my chest and I'm gonna come back to this
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.820]   in the next verse.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.820]   No, he's addressing the same crowd, okay?
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.580]   So again, understand the context in which he is saying this.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.180]   He's addressing a crowd that is coming to him,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.020]   hostile, skeptical, questioning him
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.260]   because they don't like what he is saying.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.380]   He is calling them out of their sins.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.500]   They like what he is doing,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.940]   but they don't like what he is saying,
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.620]   so they're coming to him,
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.460]   and the hostility toward Jesus is increasing.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.360]   So in the previous passage, he says,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.700]   "A wicked generation, I will give no other sign."
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.220]   I've given plenty of signs.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.860]   And you have not come to repentance,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.520]   and no more sign will be given to you
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.860]   aside from the sign of Jonah.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.180]   And we talked about that last week.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.900]   There's two things that we talked about.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.740]   One, the sign of Jonah is a clear evidence
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.020]   of who Jesus is because they wanted to reject him.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.780]   They said that the resurrection is gonna clearly prove
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.300]   that everything that he said about himself was true.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.080]   But second, he said this sign of Jonah
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.740]   is an indictment against you,
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.340]   that the people of Nineveh are gonna stand,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.620]   the queen of Sheba is gonna stand in the judgment day,
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.500]   and they will be able to testify
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.300]   about how they came to repentance
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.380]   even despite this reluctant prophet,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.060]   and you didn't repent, and because you did not repent,
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.300]   the sign of Jonah is that you are deserving
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.520]   of this punishment, of this judgment.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.220]   And then he gets into this after he says this.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.420]   So the point that I'm trying to get at
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.800]   is that what he is saying here
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.620]   is connected to the sign of Jonah.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.580]   This is a part of what he is saying to these people
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.340]   of what the sign is.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.380]   So let me give you a picture, okay,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.500]   so that we can better understand,
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.460]   so that we don't project our meanings.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.380]   Oh, we are the light, and we're supposed to live this way.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.100]   None of that is rejected in this,
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.740]   but there is a contextually more fitting understanding
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.940]   of what Jesus is saying.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:26.900]   You see, the nation of Israel was called to be the light.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.580]   Jesus made that very clear.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.020]   So when he says Luke 11 three,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.700]   "No one after lighting a lamp puts it away in a cellar
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.720]   "nor under a basket, but on the lampstand,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.540]   "so that those who enter may see the light."
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.900]   He's addressing Israel.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.240]   He said, "You crowds are coming to me,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.620]   "and the whole reason why you have been established
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.540]   "was so that you can be the light to the world.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.200]   "Instead, you have hidden your light
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.140]   "so that the world cannot see."
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.040]   In Genesis 12 two to three,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.600]   when God calls Abraham the father of Israel,
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.080]   he makes it very clear what his covenant is.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.640]   He says, "I will make you a great nation.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.320]   "I will bless you, and make your name great."
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.160]   And this is where the Israelites stopped.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.600]   They looked at the first verse,
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.160]   and it said, "And make your name great,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.600]   "that God is going to choose me
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.760]   "and to make me a great nation,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.840]   "and so you shall be a blessing,
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.380]   "and I will bless those who bless you,
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.920]   "and the one who curses you, I will curse,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.260]   "and in you, all the families of the earth will be blessed."
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.260]   The book of Jonah was in all the earth will be blessed.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.020]   So from the very get-go, the calling of Israel
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.740]   was for the purpose of the world.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.920]   He said, "I will choose you, and I will bless you,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.980]   "and I will multiply you, so that through you,
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.080]   "the world will be blessed."
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.280]   In fact, in Deuteronomy 7, seven through eight,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.140]   as they are about to enter the promised land,
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.560]   he's warning the nation of Israel,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.200]   because he knows what's in their heart.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.760]   They think that they are multiplying, having success,
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.480]   they were delivered from Pharaoh,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.320]   and they're entering to this promised land,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.200]   because there was something about them,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.720]   and God warns them, 'cause he knew.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.580]   He knew the arrogance, he knew the pride
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.480]   that's gonna creep in, because God is with them.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.760]   He says, "The Lord did not set his love on you,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.740]   "nor choose you, because you are more in number
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.800]   "than any other people, for you are the fewest
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.300]   "of all the peoples.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.460]   "But because the Lord loved you and kept his oath,
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.720]   "which he swore to your forefathers."
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.300]   He said, "The only reason why you are having
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.200]   "any kind of success is because I chose you.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.820]   "I chose to love you.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.280]   "I made a promise to your forefathers,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   "that I would do this, so I am gonna be faithful to them,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.960]   "I'm going to be faithful to my own covenant."
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.560]   But when you enter this promised land,
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.520]   when you enter this promised land, don't get it twisted.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.280]   It's not because of you.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.400]   It's not because of your number.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.160]   He's preemptively saying this, because he knew.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.480]   He knew what was in their heart,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   and that's exactly what happened to the nation of Israel.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.200]   They saw that God's choosing of them
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.280]   was somehow elevated from all of the other nations,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.560]   and they completely forgot about the world.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.780]   And that was the problem with Jonah.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.100]   See, in Psalm 67, one through four, it says,
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.940]   "God be gracious to us, and bless us,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.480]   "and cause his face to shine upon us,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.200]   "that your way may be known," where?
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.000]   On the earth.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.680]   Not just to Israel.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.500]   "Your salvation among," where?
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.400]   All the nations, not just Israel.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.040]   "Let the peoples praise you, O God,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.140]   "let all the peoples praise you.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.300]   "Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.440]   "for you will judge the peoples with uprightness,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.300]   "and guide the nations on earth."
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.760]   It was never just about Israel.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.160]   Israel just was an avenue in which he was going
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.800]   to glorify himself to the nations.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.680]   But the problem with the nation of Israel
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.120]   was they thought it was them.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.360]   They were blessed, and God gave them the law,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.960]   and God protected them, and God answered their prayer.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.400]   God caused them to conquer their enemies,
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.080]   and they completely forgot.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.320]   It wasn't simply about them.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.220]   So when Christ comes on the scene,
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.020]   one of the biggest obstacles of Jesus
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.320]   preaching about the kingdom was that the Jews
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.680]   could not accept the Gentiles into the kingdom.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.360]   If you read and study the New Testament epistles,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.320]   I would say at least 50% of the New Testament,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.700]   again, this is just from my memory,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.900]   is dealing with the Judaizers,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.960]   because they could not understand
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.560]   how God was with them for so many years,
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.120]   and all of a sudden, God's blessing
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.880]   is gonna go out to the nations.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.660]   So the Judaizers were the ones who were in the middle
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.740]   saying, "You know what?
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.140]   "We see clearly that Jesus was risen from the dead,
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.200]   "and we can't deny him."
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.520]   But they refused to let go of their kingdom.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.680]   So what they began to do is they began
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.320]   to synchronize Judaism with Christianity.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.760]   They said, "We'll let you into the kingdom,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.200]   "but you have to be a Jew first.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.780]   "You have to practice what we practice.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.120]   "You have to have the festivals.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.320]   "You have to be circumcised.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.600]   "You have to keep the Sabbath."
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.520]   And so much of the New Testament
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.640]   is trying to convince the Jews
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.960]   that the kingdom has been opened,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.280]   that this was God's intent from the beginning.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.800]   Now, you're sitting here listening to this.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.240]   Some of you guys are a little bit more
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.040]   theologically astute and say, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.800]   Or some of you guys are sitting in here.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.720]   It's like, "Yeah, that's for pastors and theologians."
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.480]   Like, what's the relevance of this?
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.840]   The relevance of this is if you don't understand this,
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   you're gonna miss the whole point of why you and I are here,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.520]   just like the nation of Israel.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.760]   See, Jonah did not simply represent a wayward person.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.260]   A lot of people interpret Jonah and say,
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.980]   "Well, Jonah didn't obey God,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.720]   "so if you don't obey God,
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.280]   "something bad's gonna happen to you,
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.500]   "so you better go."
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.080]   The end.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.640]   That is not the point of Jonah.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.520]   Jonah represented not only a wayward prophet,
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.200]   but the nation of Israel.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.400]   They forgot their calling.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.920]   They forgot their place in the world,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.440]   that the whole reason why they existed
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.960]   was that through them, God would be glorified,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.440]   and all the other nations would come and glorify him.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.180]   You see, if you and I forget why God established us,
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:51.520]   everything becomes about us.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.600]   Everything becomes about us.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.960]   How does this church help me with my family?
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.140]   How does this church help me with my marriage?
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.680]   How does this church help me with my children?
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   And again, there's nothing wrong with any of that,
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.100]   but the whole reason why Jesus said,
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.700]   "I will build my church, and gates of Hades
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.100]   "will not prevail against it,"
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.100]   is so that we may shine light in darkness.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.060]   So if we forget, if we're not living according to his will,
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.740]   when we say, "Your will be done on earth
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.260]   "as it is in heaven," this is his will.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.820]   Whole book of the Bible is God pursuing sinners
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.380]   so that we can be the light.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.760]   But if all we're concerned about is my family,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.500]   my marriage, my retirement, my business, my well-being,
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.900]   then we are Jonahs.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.700]   We have forgotten why we're here.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.460]   And that's exactly what was happening to Jonah.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.660]   And that's why in Luke chapter 15,
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.080]   when Jesus is talking to sinners and tax collectors,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.640]   the Pharisees come to Jesus and say,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.840]   "Why are you hanging around the sinners?"
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.260]   Now, Jesus doesn't directly answer them.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.000]   "Well, the reason why I'm hanging around sinners
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.720]   "is because of this, this, and this, and this."
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   He doesn't say that.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.640]   He gives three parables in response.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.440]   Parable of the lost sheep, parable of the lost coin,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.760]   parable of the lost son, prodigal son.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.720]   And each one of those stories is about God
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   pursuing the lost and celebrating because they are found.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.960]   The lost sheep comes, they celebrate.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.040]   The lost coin is found, they celebrate.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.000]   Prodigal son comes back, receives him
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.060]   all the way back into his own household,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.400]   and then they celebrate.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.880]   And in doing so, he was turning the table on them.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.640]   You're asking me why I am with the sinners.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.620]   And he's turning around saying,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.720]   "Why aren't you with the sinners?"
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.680]   You do not understand the heart of God.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.200]   You don't understand why we're here.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.420]   You don't realize why you and I are here.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.160]   You don't realize why you're studying the Bible.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.660]   You don't realize why we need to pray.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.240]   Why we need to be godly.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.840]   Why we need to be holy.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   Because you have forgotten your calling.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.460]   See, this was a rebuke to these people
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.660]   who are questioning him.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:19.880]   And just as Israel forgot their calling,
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.580]   Jonah forgot his calling.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.360]   He says, "If we forget this,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.960]   "we will completely miss the whole point."
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.540]   In Luke chapter 11, 34 to 36, he says,
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.300]   "The eye is the lamp of your body.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.540]   "When your eye is clear,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.440]   "your whole body also is full of light.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.280]   "But when it is bad,
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   "your body also is full of darkness.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.560]   "Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.380]   "If therefore your whole body is full of light
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.660]   "with no dark part in it,
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.560]   "it will be wholly illumined."
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.520]   That's when the lamp illumines you with its rays.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   Now obviously, he's talking about the eyes.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.340]   That because the eyes have been corrupt,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.440]   there's no light be able to come in.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.820]   And because no light is able to come in,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.280]   you're not able to see any other light.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.900]   Now, what is that in reference to?
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.940]   Now, remember, he's talking to a group of people
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.960]   who do not recognize Jesus.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.660]   Jesus performed all the miracles.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.940]   He cast out demons, and he said,
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.520]   "Oh, that can't be the Messiah."
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.380]   After all the miracles that they performed,
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.500]   they still could not see the Messiah
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.900]   standing right in front of them
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.740]   with all the power, all his might.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.940]   And they said, "Oh, you must be demonic."
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.860]   He's rebuking them.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.140]   The reason why you don't see me
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.780]   is because your eyes are dark.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.020]   And you're blaming me, but the reason why
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.940]   is because you have coveting in your eyes.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.520]   Remember when Apostle Paul, when he met Christ,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.380]   he becomes blind for three days?
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.540]   Remember what happens after three days?
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.540]   Jesus sends a prophet, prays over him,
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.800]   and then after three days, he said,
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   "The scales fall off his eyes," and then he sees.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.240]   That's what a Christian experiences
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.760]   when he comes to Christ.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.780]   The scales in our eyes fall off,
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.620]   and all of a sudden, just like it says
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.900]   in 2 Corinthians 4:4, we begin to see the glory
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.660]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.100]   And what is this glory?
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.660]   What is this light that all of a sudden we see?
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.300]   Jesus says, in John 1.4.5, "In him was life,
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.380]   "and the life was the light of men."
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.020]   Jesus is the light.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.220]   "The light shines in darkness,
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.720]   "and the darkness did not comprehend it."
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.460]   John 1.9-11, "There was the true light
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.220]   "of which coming into the world.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.240]   "In light is every man.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.440]   "He was in the world, and the world was made through him,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.760]   "and the world did not know him.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.220]   "He came to his own, and those who are his own
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.040]   "did not receive him."
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.720]   He was basically telling them,
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.700]   "The reason why you don't see me
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.300]   "is 'cause you got scales on."
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.720]   The light of the world, the creator of the universe,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.420]   has proven and given every possible sign
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.900]   that he can give, and you don't see him.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.100]   It's not because the light isn't bright enough.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.600]   It's not because God hasn't given enough evidence.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   It's because you are wearing sunglasses.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.180]   Darkened sunglasses.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.700]   It's because of your own sins.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.320]   Jesus says, "He is the light of the world."
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.660]   In Psalm 36.9, it says, "For with you
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.760]   "is the fountain of life.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   "In your light, we see light."
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.240]   Until the scales fall off,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.120]   and we see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.700]   we see the beauty of Christ, we don't see anything else.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.720]   You could be at the church,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.880]   and I know plenty of people who love the church,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.460]   but they don't love Christ.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.880]   They love purpose, but they don't love Christ.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.240]   They love the community, but they don't love Christ.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.820]   And because they have not seen the beauty of Christ,
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.760]   everything else seems beautiful.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.620]   And the church feels like a hindrance.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.200]   You know, I wanna drive the car that I want.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.540]   I wanna live in the house that I want.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.560]   I wanna eat whatever I want.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.040]   I wanna travel, I wanna do all this stuff.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.000]   Every time I come to church, they just make me feel guilty.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.300]   And so they see the word of God and the preaching of God
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.660]   as a hindrance to their happiness.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.540]   So what he's saying here is, if your eyes become open
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.780]   and the light of Christ comes in,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.580]   all of a sudden, you see the beauty
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.780]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.340]   And that's what glory is.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.360]   Glory is the shining of God's beauty to the world.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.420]   That's what glory is.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:51.080]   You don't have glory if you're in a closet.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.640]   There's nothing to shine, right?
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.000]   The very idea of a light or glory
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.880]   is for the purpose for other people to see.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.380]   That's what glory means.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.360]   And so he says, if your eyes have been open
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.640]   and you saw the beauty of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.600]   all of a sudden, you covered him
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.620]   more than anything else in this world.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.740]   And until Christ becomes more beautiful
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.900]   than anything else that is tempting you,
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.940]   you will not overcome your temptation.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.780]   You will not overcome your temptation.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.460]   So many Christians live hungry, hanging out at a buffet,
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.940]   and wondering why they keep getting tempted.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.300]   You know what the best way not to be tempted in a buffet?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.200]   You go into the buffet when you are full.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.240]   When you are full.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.700]   And you just can't eat anymore.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.420]   You walk through a buffet and all of a sudden,
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.780]   you're not tempted anymore.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.420]   It's because we're still hungry.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   Because we're not attracted to Christ.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.560]   How you and I, rich people,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.940]   think about all the things that the people in this world
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.200]   can possibly imagine that they could be tempted by.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.760]   You and I actually have access to that.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.120]   You saw some clothing, I want that, so you get it.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.460]   You see somebody else travel to this beautiful place,
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.380]   you know, I'm gonna save enough money, I'm gonna get it.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.360]   See a car you want, you get it, you know.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.220]   House, I mean, you're not multi-millionaires,
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.220]   but we save up enough and move things around,
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.740]   and invest enough, and get a job,
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.900]   and work hard, and we can get it.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.940]   You and I have access to everything that we are watching,
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.980]   that we are tempted by.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.180]   How will you overcome this temptation?
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.620]   If it is simply by discipline?
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.380]   If you have enough accountability?
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.680]   If you memorize enough scripture?
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.320]   If you have good leaders?
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.480]   How will you overcome this temptation?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.100]   If you are still hungry?
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.640]   If you're looking at the world,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.160]   and it seems beautiful to you,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.680]   and then every time you come to church,
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.740]   and we keep telling you it's not beautiful,
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.920]   but you feel it's beautiful,
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.680]   you're looking at what's beautiful.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.400]   The only way to overcome darkness is if the light,
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.440]   outshines the darkness.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.320]   And that's what Paul meant when he says,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.960]   everything became rubbish.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.980]   It didn't just become rubbish because out of pure will,
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.840]   he memorized some scripture,
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.200]   he had good accountability,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.800]   he read some books, and he exposited the Bible,
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.200]   and somehow the hunger went away.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.040]   No.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   Until we are filled with the light of Christ,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.400]   that hunger will remain.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.020]   The coveting remains.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.000]   And then all we do is feel guilty,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.620]   because you are not overcoming the darkness.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.000]   The only way to overcome darkness
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.400]   is to be filled with Christ.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.360]   And that's what he is saying.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.680]   He said the reason why you don't recognize me,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.100]   despite all the evidence I've given to you,
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.800]   is because your coveting remains.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.320]   You desire.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   You don't desire me.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.540]   You desire what I can give you.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.920]   You still covet the world,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.720]   you just want me to give it to you.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.360]   So you come to church and serve,
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.960]   you give, you have accountability,
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.080]   you have membership, you have all this stuff,
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.300]   but at the end of the day,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.520]   your main goal hasn't changed.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.320]   Your desire hasn't changed.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.960]   Christ and Christ alone can deliver us.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.000]   So the most important question that we ask,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.600]   that every Christian should ask,
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.280]   is what Jesus asked the disciples.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.700]   Who do you say that I am?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:50.080]   Not what the teachers say,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.280]   not what the theologians say,
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.720]   not what the reformed communities say,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.840]   not what the Baptists say,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.120]   not what my pastor says.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.320]   Who do you say that I am?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.920]   And let me ask you another way.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.720]   Because he said the greatest command
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.680]   is to love the Lord your God
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.400]   with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.440]   And it's the same question.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.920]   Do you love Jesus?
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:18.400]   Not, I should love Jesus,
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.600]   I could love Jesus,
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.160]   I want to love Jesus.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.120]   The question is, do you love Jesus?
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.160]   Is Jesus your goal?
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.280]   If you had Jesus and you lost everything,
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.840]   would you still be okay?
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   If you had Jesus and you lost all your friends,
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.680]   would you be okay?
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.640]   If you had Jesus and you lost your children,
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.840]   would you be okay?
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.880]   If you had Jesus and you never married,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.080]   would you be okay?
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.720]   If you had Jesus
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.560]   and your business goes bankrupt,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.720]   would you be okay?
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.900]   That's the most important question
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.740]   that any Christian should be asking.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.860]   Because at the core of it,
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.640]   if Christ is not enough,
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.420]   we will always be coveting everything else.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.480]   And the reason why they could not see Jesus
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.680]   is because Jesus is not what they wanted.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.560]   They wanted the bread,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.060]   they wanted a king,
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.240]   they wanted to be part of a superpower,
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.400]   they wanted to eat.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.220]   So this was an indictment against these people.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.500]   And the sign of Jonah was a warning to them,
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.460]   that you and I have been called here
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.300]   for the purpose of being the light.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:50.620]   Everything else, again, I apologize,
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.800]   because I know some of you guys are suffering,
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.900]   I know some of you guys are in pain,
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.620]   and I don't mean to trivialize your pain.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.900]   Because pain is pain, no matter what.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.800]   But, all this is temporary.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.520]   All this is temporary.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:12.160]   That no matter what it is that you're going through,
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.640]   if we have Christ, it is enough.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.740]   It is enough.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.240]   If I don't get to live in a big house,
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.220]   I still have heaven.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.200]   If I die early, I still have heaven.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.360]   If my business goes bankrupt, I still have Jesus.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.900]   If I lose all my friends, I still have Jesus.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.940]   Is Jesus enough?
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:48.120]   Until the light of Christ shines,
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:54.080]   we remain in darkness, and we will continue to covet,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.780]   and we will remain blind.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.580]   We're in the presence of the greatest gift
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.420]   that you can possibly imagine.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.220]   If you ask me, if I never read the Bible,
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.880]   if I never heard the gospel,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.860]   and somebody told me that the God who created me
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.900]   loved me so much, despite the fact,
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.140]   despite all my rebellion and blasphemous speaking,
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.340]   that instead of judging me,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:26.460]   he sent his only begotten son to take my sin upon himself,
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.780]   and he suffered for my sins, I would say, get out of here.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.060]   If somebody came in and said, hey, I got $200,
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.100]   I'm just gonna give you, like, why?
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.380]   That's hard to believe.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.780]   Why would you do that?
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.900]   Oh, we got a car, if you come down and say,
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.240]   oh, this must be a scam.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.020]   Son of God died for me?
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:52.140]   We live every single day celebrating this,
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.380]   singing this, memorizing this, teaching this other people.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.620]   And then it's not enough.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.860]   After we sang it, after we told people,
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.380]   after we memorized people, and then we live every day,
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.440]   it's not enough.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.560]   If we're not careful, we can be just as blind.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.580]   We can miss the whole point of why you and I are here.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.600]   And that's my third sign.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.020]   The first sign of Jonah is identity of Jesus.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.820]   Second sign of Jonah was an indictment against Israel.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:29.580]   Third sign of Jonah is a demonstration of God's mercy.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.500]   As much as we may be convicted and say,
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   wow, I feel guilty again, he did it again,
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.220]   you know, we're gonna leave church again, feeling guilty,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.940]   but I want you to understand what he is saying here.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.620]   All of this is a demonstration of the kindness of God.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.720]   Jonah chapter 4, one through two, after Nineveh repents,
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.480]   Jonah is angry, 'cause he hated Nineveh.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.860]   He wanted them to be judged, but they repent.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.020]   A revival breaks out, and this is what he says.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.000]   It greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.180]   He prayed to the Lord and said,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.860]   please, Lord, was not this what I said
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.740]   while I was still in my own country?
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.160]   Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.380]   He said, he didn't, the reason why he didn't wanna go
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.940]   to Nineveh was not because he was lazy
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.780]   or he had some other businesses
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.780]   and he just doesn't like preaching the gospel.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.600]   He didn't want God to be gracious.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.940]   He said, that's why he didn't go.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.620]   For I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.660]   slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness,
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.220]   and one who relents concerning calamity.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.300]   He says, I knew it.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.540]   How did he know?
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.400]   How did Jonah know this?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.000]   That God was gonna forgive them?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.600]   A lot of people read the Old Testament superficially
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.480]   and say, oh, didn't he bring the flood
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.640]   and kill the nations?
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.720]   Didn't he bring judgment against them and against this?
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.940]   And it's like, God is so harsh,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.480]   but that's not what Jonah says.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.120]   He said, from what I know, I knew you would be gracious.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.080]   I knew you were slow to become angry.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.720]   I think for two reasons.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   One, he's a living proof of it.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.820]   The fact that he is living and he is breathing
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.140]   and the fact that he's able to complain was God's grace.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.860]   Remember, he rebelled against God
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.380]   and he ran the other direction.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.800]   And because of that, the storm came.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.460]   He should have died in the water.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.660]   Instead of dying in the water,
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.780]   he got swallowed up by the whale.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.940]   He should have died in the whale.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.060]   But he doesn't die in the water.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.100]   He doesn't die in the whale
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.780]   because God had a purpose for him.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.780]   So the fact that he got spit out,
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:46.320]   stinking like a fish and walking around complaining
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.580]   is evidence of God's mercy.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.980]   So he has personal knowledge of this grace.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.300]   He knows he deserved to die.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.760]   He said no to God.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.620]   God told him to go right and he went left.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:04.620]   So if he died, he said, yeah, because I'm disobeying God.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.100]   So he has personal knowledge of it.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.700]   But second, during the time of Jonah,
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.380]   Israel, Israel was in rebellion against God.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.600]   It wasn't just Nineveh.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.660]   During his reign, during Jonah's ministry,
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.660]   Jeroboam II was the king.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.300]   And during that period, they were committing idolatry,
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.860]   all kinds of moral failures.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.100]   And all the while, they were worshiping God
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.300]   and going to the temple.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.940]   You know who the contemporaries are?
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.380]   It was Hosea and Amos.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.420]   Hosea and Amos preached at the same time
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.580]   that Jonah was prophesying.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:49.260]   If you know the book of Hosea,
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.700]   God tells Hosea to go marry this prostitute named Gomer.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.460]   And then he says, love her.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.580]   And then she goes out and commits adultery
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.020]   and she keeps giving herself to other men.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.860]   And then God, instead of rejecting her,
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.740]   says go love her and then he brings her back.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.820]   And then she goes and commits adultery
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.500]   and then he brings her back.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.980]   And then he goes and does this repeatedly.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.500]   And then God uses that as an illustration to tell Israel,
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.280]   this is what my relationship with Israel is like.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.100]   I keep forgiving, I keep forgiving,
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.940]   and you keep committing adultery, you keep adultery.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.020]   And it's warning them, if you keep doing this,
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.600]   that his mercy and his grace is gonna run out.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.260]   Book of Amos.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.740]   The Amos is another prophet, his contemporary.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.100]   He says, I hate, I reject your festivals.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.820]   Nor do I delight in your solemn assembly.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.380]   Even though you offer up to me burnt offerings
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.820]   and your grain offerings, I will not accept them.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.020]   And I will not even look at the peace offering
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.260]   of your fatlings.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.140]   Take away from me the noise of your songs.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.100]   I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.540]   That's one of the harshest, brutal criticisms
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.740]   to the nation of Israel.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.220]   Now you may look at that and say,
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.340]   well how does that demonstrate the mercy and grace of God?
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.060]   Because he says what he says.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.980]   He sends Hosea, he sends Amos, he sends Jonah,
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.580]   pleading with sinners to repent
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.260]   because he's eager to forgive.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:27.380]   If God was not gracious, there would be no Amos.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:33.940]   There would be no Hezekiah, there would be no Hosea.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.140]   There would be no Jonah.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:40.860]   So wait a second, Jonah didn't give a message of grace.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.740]   He said, despite all your sin,
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.220]   God is so gracious and loving and just come to him.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.640]   He's so gracious and loving.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.980]   That's not the message he gave.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.480]   He said, repent.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.420]   In a short while, if you do not repent,
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.460]   the judgment of God is gonna come.
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:01.680]   And that was God's mercy, that was his grace,
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.120]   that was his patience toward them.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.980]   Our generation thinks if we preach repentance,
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.460]   that somehow that's being judgmental,
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.340]   it's being legalistic and it's being harsh.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.800]   And scripture says it is the kindness of God
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.280]   that leads us to repentance.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.940]   Before we skip to forgiveness,
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.400]   forgiveness is an end result of repentance.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:36.020]   You know what's interesting is the whole book of Jonah
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.500]   ends with verse 11, chapter four.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.600]   Look at what he says.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.560]   Should I not have compassion on Nineveh,
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.900]   the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:50.680]   who do not know the difference between their right
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.660]   and left hand as well as many animals?
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.620]   That's how it ends.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.260]   There's no response, there's no this is why.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.560]   He just says, what's it to you that I have compassion?
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.680]   If I wanna forgive them, what's it to you?
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.520]   The end.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.680]   That's the main point of Jonah.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.840]   It's not don't mess with God or you're gonna be
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.880]   swallowed up by a whale.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.640]   That's not the point.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.040]   If God calls you, you better go, right?
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.180]   Which is true, but that's not the point.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.660]   The point that he was trying to make is
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.320]   this was God's plan all along.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.100]   God is pursuing sinners.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.780]   Even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.840]   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.980]   We pray the Lord's Prayer.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.740]   Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.660]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.580]   as it is in heaven.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.860]   How much of our frustration in our life
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.660]   is because we are trying to get God to bend to our will?
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:58.420]   If you pray, thy kingdom come, thy will be done
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.720]   on earth as it is in heaven, this is his will.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:07.300]   We're waiting for him, but he's waiting for us
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:11.800]   to be the light that you and I have been called to be.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.500]   The reason why the church has been established,
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.800]   he says, I will build my church.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.940]   Gates of Hades will not prevail against it
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.140]   so that we may enter into the darkness
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.160]   and shine the light and stop hiding it under the table.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.300]   And it is his kindness, it is his mercy.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.140]   In 2 Peter 3, 9, in the first century church,
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.780]   they were beginning to ask and question,
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.420]   why isn't Jesus coming back?
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.060]   Because the persecution is increasing.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.820]   Nero is beginning to behead their leaders.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.900]   People are being burned at the stake, being crucified,
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.380]   and they're trying to squash Christianity.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.760]   And so people are asking, why does he not care?
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.780]   How come God doesn't care?
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.380]   Why is he not coming back and rescuing us
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.860]   from this horror?
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.080]   We're not just talking about being weird.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.600]   People are literally being torn apart in Colosseans
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.920]   when 2 Peter is being written.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.280]   They've seen their leaders being burned at the stake
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.240]   and being crucified upside down
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.960]   when 2 Peter was being written.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.580]   And so people are asking, why does he not care?
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.480]   He's supposed to be a gracious, merciful,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.300]   loving, patient God, why did he not come?
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.960]   In response to that, he says,
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.080]   the Lord is not slow about his promise,
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.600]   as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.640]   not wishing for any to perish,
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.240]   but for all to come to repentance.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.520]   Not only is he patient,
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.320]   but the whole reason why he hasn't come
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.360]   is so that he may be patient,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.880]   so that he may be gracious.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:50.260]   He was patient so you and I can come into the kingdom.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.340]   He is patient so that you and I
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.800]   could take the light to the world.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.120]   We live our life and study the Bible,
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.760]   raise good children,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.880]   have a nice church where people love each other,
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   and we're second generation,
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.120]   hand over this nice building and VBS,
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.820]   and we're doing all of this stuff.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.840]   Great, this is such a blessing from God.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.260]   But if you forget that the heartbeat of our God
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.120]   is to pursue sinners,
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.520]   all of this is just for you.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.820]   You wanna have a nice church for you,
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.420]   you wanna have nice, obedient children for you,
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.440]   you wanna have good Bible study for you,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.920]   you wanna study the Bible and good theology for you.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.840]   If the word of God is to equip us, equip us for what?
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.860]   To train us, to train us for what?
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.320]   If we need to have a godly community, for what?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.140]   So that we can be around nice people
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.940]   who don't say harsh things?
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.180]   So that we can be around gracious people
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.120]   because the people out there are so bad?
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.300]   So if we come to church that would be,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.880]   I'd rather be with nice people who I can trust?
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.980]   That's why we're here?
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.660]   No.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.860]   Everything that God has called us to do
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.660]   is so that we can be a brighter light.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.140]   Why do we need to be holy?
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:22.020]   Why do we need to be holy?
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.460]   So that we can be the light of Christ in the darkness.
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.100]   It's for them.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:32.440]   To glorify God so that they can see the glory of our gospel.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.940]   It is God's kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.100]   It is his kindness that you and I are here.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.700]   It is God's kindness that convicts us
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.260]   and calls us to repentance.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.620]   It is the kindness of God that will not allow you
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.960]   to be lukewarm.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.100]   That you just stay week after week just lukewarm,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.260]   just worried about your life
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.060]   and never shining the light to the world
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.540]   and you come to church feeling guilty.
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.320]   That guilt is the kindness of God
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.780]   that hopefully will lead you to repentance.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.300]   So that when you pray thy will be done
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.660]   on earth as it is heaven,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.220]   that you can have a clear conscience
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.660]   and pray that and mean it with all your heart.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.220]   It's not just some religious thing that you're saying.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.940]   I pray that this morning as we come to the communion table,
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.260]   in our weakness,
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:27.180]   that God would restore his purpose and his will
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.840]   and his light in our church.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.900]   So let me ask the praise team to come up.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:36.020]   And as we have the leaders to come
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.420]   and I ask you to open up the table.
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.020]   Okay, if I can ask the pastors to come
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.620]   and open up the communion table.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.620]   One by one, when you are ready, we ask you to come.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:52.740]   So after we sing the communion song,
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:58.540]   I pray that whenever you are ready,
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.740]   one by one, that you would come.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.380]   And again, I ask that if you are not baptized,
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.620]   that you would remain in your seat.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.860]   And this is for those who have confessed their sins
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.260]   and have met the Lord
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.800]   and to come before the Lord in honest confession.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.620]   Lord, I covet the world.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.420]   I don't know when's the last time
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.620]   I've remembered the beauty of Christ outside of words.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.660]   And we ask ourselves, do you love Jesus?
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.340]   Are you pursuing Christ?
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:37.280]   When's the last time you really felt like you worship God
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.520]   in spirit and in truth?
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.340]   To take some time to reflect and to pray and to confess.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.400]   Lord, I believe, help my unbelief
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.280]   that as we come to the communion table,
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.000]   that we would come ready.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.280]   Not because you're righteous,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.000]   but because we need his righteousness.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.520]   Not because your spirit is strong,
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.040]   but because we need his spirit.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   So let me read the text for us
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.480]   and then after our praise team leads us in the song,
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.280]   when you are ready, please come one by one.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.220]   And then if you need to have gluten-free things,
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.900]   it'll be on my right to your left.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.720]   And the rest of you, if you come down this middle,
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.920]   please do not clog up the middle.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.040]   Make sure there's two lines when you come up.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.280]   For I received from the Lord
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.880]   that which I also delivered to you,
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.220]   that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.080]   in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.640]   When he had given things, he broke it and said,
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.120]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.720]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.000]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.660]   saying, "This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.620]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.100]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.400]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.800]   Father, we come before you in this sacred time.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.200]   We pray that you would ready us,
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.800]   that you would sanctify us, renew us and strengthen us,
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.720]   that our church, Lord God, would be the church
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.680]   that you desire and that you build,
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.500]   that Christ and his light would be at the center,
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.820]   that it may shed light on all other things.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.960]   May Christ be magnified through this time.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.880]   (gentle piano music)
