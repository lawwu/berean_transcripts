[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:59.960]   Thank you.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:29.940]   Thank you.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:59.920]   Thank you.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:29.900]   Thank you.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:59.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:09.680]   Good morning, church family.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.900]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.560]   You will now begin our service.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:27.580]   You did not wait.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:39.320]   Do not wait for me to draw near to you, but you hold yourself with real humanity.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:53.740]   Do not wait for me to cry out to you, but you let me hear your voice calling me.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:11.120]   I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   You did not wait for me to cry out to you, but you let me hear your voice.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:48.120]   You did not wait for me to cry out to you, but you let me hear your voice calling me, I'll forever grateful to you.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful for the loss.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   I'm forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.920]   That you came to see you, I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful for the cross.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:41.900]   I'm forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you, I'll forever grateful to you, that you came to seek and save the Lord.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:06:11.880]   All right, good morning, welcome to Brewing Community Church.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:21.520]   There's going to be a PTA meeting, so they're going to be going over the church curriculum and be taking some time to pray for the students, so please be there at 2 p.m.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.300]   And then afterwards, Family Ministry Workshop.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:34.540]   This coming Saturday, Pastor Mark is leading a workshop with the title of Peacemaking, and so it's happening this Saturday at 10 a.m. in the cafe area, so please sign up for that.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.240]   So, child care will be provided for both, for today's meeting and also for the Saturday's meeting, just keep that in mind.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.060]   Our outreach team is hosting another outreach happening at the Spectrum in the Source OC.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.540]   If you want to participate in that, it's coming Saturday at 1 p.m., so you can sign up for that.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.380]   And then College Ministry.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.080]   So if you are a college student coming into town or you brought a college student, especially for the semester schools.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.780]   So they have a tent outside.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:09.480]   They're going to have it there every Sunday for now until, obviously, all the UCI students come back into town in a few weeks.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:18.960]   So that red tent is where you want to go, and if you want to ask any questions or just kind of ask about what kind of activities they have in the college ministry, that's under the red tent as you go outside in the courtyard.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:28.760]   And then finally, the southbound 55 freeway on MacArthur exit is going to be closed starting from, I think, Tuesday on the 9th.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   Is today the 7th?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:43.180]   Yeah, so on the 9th, so if you're coming from the 5 freeway, whether it's Wednesday Bible study or Thursday or Friday, for the next two weeks, that exit is going to be closed.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:51.500]   So meaning that you're going to have to either get off an exit before that on Dyer, or you're going to have to come all day around and come off on the 405 freeway.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.820]   So if you're coming northbound, it doesn't matter.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:02.180]   But if you're coming southbound, like that's 5 coming toward the church, that MacArthur exit is going to be closed for the next couple weeks, just to give you a heads up, okay?
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:10.200]   All right, let me pray for the offering, and then after the offering, our brother Elliot is going to come, and he's going to give his testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.720]   Let's pray.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.820]   Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace and love that you pour upon us.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:27.440]   Help us, Lord God, to give you worship that is pleasing to you, that is in spirit and in truth.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.560]   I pray that our heart, our mind, our very wills, Lord God, would be surrendered to you.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:43.180]   Open our eyes that we may see the glory of Christ, that our lives, our hope, our desire may all continue to shift toward you.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   I pray that you would bless this time and bless the giving.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.880]   May it be given joyfully, bountifully, and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.820]   Amen.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:55.960]   Amen.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:25.940]   Thank you.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:43.420]   Let us all rise in and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:10:13.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   Thank you.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Thank you.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   They will vanish like a breath. Yes, I know the outcome, sure. Satan's evil plans will fail. In your power I'm secure.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   You're my sorrow and my salvation, my steadfast hope that won't be shaken. My soul will wait, my soul will wait for you.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:19.080]   You're my comfort when I feel force within my refuge and my sure foundation. My soul will wait, my soul will wait for you.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   This is love I can't explain. This is mercy unreserved. Through your sacrifice so great, I have peace that's undeserved.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   For the battle has been won and I feel ashamed or loss. Now the scene of death is gone. You're my sorrow and my salvation, my steadfast hope that won't be shaken.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   My soul will wait, my soul will wait for you. You're my conqueror when I feel forsaken. My refuge and my sure foundation. My soul will wait, my soul will wait for you.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:24.380]   Glory out on hearts before you.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.380]   Glory out on hearts before you.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.380]   Perfect Savior, strong defender. We will trust in you.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:49.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.380]   Glory out on hearts before you. We will trust in you.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:15:08.380]   Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:19.380]   Thou be all else to me, stay that thou art.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   Thou my best love, thy table by night.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:41.380]   Waking or sleeping, thy presence by night.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:59.380]   Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:10.380]   I'm ever with thee, and thou art me, Lord.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:21.380]   Thou my great Father, I thy true Son.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:32.380]   Thou may be dwelling, and thou may be one.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   Thou may be one.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:54.380]   Thou may be one.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:05.380]   Thou may be one.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.380]   Thou may be one.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:32.380]   Thou may be one.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   May I reach heaven's choice, O I have it son.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   Heart of my own, whatever before, still be my vision, O ruler of all.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   Heart of my own heart, whatever before, still be my vision, O ruler of all.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:50.380]   Good morning, my name is Elliott and I'm a junior in high school.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:57.380]   So first I'm going to talk about my life before Christ and the self glory that I lived in.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.380]   I saw my previous life before Christ as filled with pride.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.380]   I only valued what I saw as valuable.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.380]   I neglected and mistreated so many people in my life.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:16.380]   I took advantage of the love they gave me and did not take for granted all the support I had around me.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   I spent all my time on trying to grow my status and my achievements.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:31.380]   I thought my athletic achievements or academic performance would validate me that the world would love me because I was successful.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   So for context, I've been at Berean for over 10 years.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:46.380]   I've almost grown up in this church and I've grown up hearing such great messages about the character of Jesus that he died for us.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:59.380]   And I remember coming to church as this place where I heard these cool fantasy stories about this good guy that lived a while ago and I always told myself that I'd worry about it later.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:05.380]   And I would devote myself when I wasn't so busy with school and I had the free time.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:11.380]   So in October 2021, there were some drastic changes in my life.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.380]   My dad had collapsed in the garage during the night for a mysterious reason.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.380]   He had suffered a traumatic brain injury and was incoherent of his surroundings.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.380]   He struggled to recognize who I was.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.380]   Due to my age, I was not allowed to visit him in the ICU.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.380]   I was overcome with anger and grief over the fear of losing my father.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.380]   This marked one of the first times in my life where I turned to the Lord.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:41.380]   Although I had been taught to pray at meals or before I slept, this time I remember praying intensely to God in anger.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.380]   I bashed God for hurting me and potentially taking away one of my greatest loves.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.380]   I felt helpless and selfishly demanded that God fix this situation.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.380]   I remember even boldly telling God that I had hate for him.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:02.380]   Even in this anger and loss though, I was so defeated that I had asked God if he truly was real to heal my dad.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.380]   I prayed without having faith that this would come true.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.380]   Slowly, my dad began to heal and show signs of improvement.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.380]   Still, doctors warned that chances of full recovery were slim.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.380]   Miraculously, my dad healed at a rapid pace.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   Within six months, he had regained most of his life back.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.380]   Experts even had a hard time explaining at his rapid pace.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.380]   I slowly realized that God really was an all-powerful, benevolent Father.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.380]   I learned to cherish the time that I had of my loved ones.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.380]   That every day we live is a blessing from the Lord.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.380]   Even after this, I did not immediately give my life to Christ.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.380]   I began to grow in hunger for God, but clinged on to the world.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.380]   It was only after a week in the mountains in 2023 when I gave my life to Christ.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:52.380]   I remember vividly grasping the weight of my sin, how helpless I truly was in the battle against my flesh.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   I was filled with this heavy weight that dragged me down, and I realized that I was dead in my trespasses.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.380]   I submitted myself to the Lord and asked for him to take me as I was.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:10.380]   I pleaded for God to forgive me of my sin and declared that through Jesus' death and resurrection that I was saved.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.380]   Since giving my life to Christ, I have seen several spiritual fruits in my life.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:21.380]   I have now seen a desire to be away from the world, just as in Romans 12:1-2 it says,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.380]   "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.380]   so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:44.380]   I have also seen how I can be steadfast in numerous trials of my life.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:50.380]   I saw what I used to see as the greatest tragedy in my life, as the greatest act in which God worked for me.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.380]   What some would see as the potential loss of a father, I saw it as the event that brought me closer to God the Father.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.380]   I am now so thankful for this event, since it showed me the character of God,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:07.380]   that God showed me how urgently we must live life, and that I must devote my life to him and glorify him.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   I have seen a desire to spread the word and the good news to those around me.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.380]   I have seen my relationships improve and my heart grow in gentleness.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:26.380]   Finally, I want to end with an impactful passage that I read when I was giving my life to Christ in Ephesians 2:8-10.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.380]   It says,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.380]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God,
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.380]   not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.380]   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.380]   which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.380]   Thanks.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:51.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   Thank you.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:26.360]   Thank you.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:44.160]   All right. Thank you, Elliot, for that awesome testimony.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.420]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 12.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:55.340]   Reading out of the NASB, I'm going to be reading from verse 13 all the way down to verse 21.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:01.760]   Luke chapter 12, 13 through 21.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:27.480]   And he told them a parable saying,
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.460]   The land of a rich man was very productive.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.960]   And he began reasoning to himself, saying,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.080]   What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.320]   Then he said, This is what I will do.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.720]   I will tear down my barns and build larger ones,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.380]   and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.160]   And I will say to my soul,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.980]   Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.180]   But God said to him, You fool, this very night your soul is required of you.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.720]   And how and now, who will own what you have prepared?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.600]   So it is a man who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:11.500]   Father, we come before you asking for your direction,
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.780]   that we may comprehend your will, your thoughts,
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.880]   that we may surrender our lives.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.620]   I pray that you would search us through your word,
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.140]   that we may have a glimpse of who you are,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.360]   that we may have a better understanding of what resides in our own hearts.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.380]   We lift this time to you, Father.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:32.680]   Amen.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.880]   What is the mission of the church?
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.480]   What is the mission of the church?
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.000]   If you've been at a church any period of time,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.880]   you probably already know that answer, right?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.000]   You probably heard many messages about that.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.960]   That Jesus called his disciples,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.420]   Come, follow me, and I will make you disciples of men.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.420]   He spent all three years preparing his disciples
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.100]   to take the baton when Jesus leaves to go spread the gospel.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.900]   And then afterwards, the very last commission,
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.180]   what we call the Great Commission,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.540]   he says, Go, therefore, make disciples of all the nations.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.040]   So everything that Jesus did during this life
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.340]   was to prepare the disciples.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.960]   So when we say, What is the mission of the church?
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   It is not one of many missions that we pick and choose.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.400]   You know, for our church, it's going to be the Great Commission.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.740]   For another church, it's going to be social justice.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.040]   Another church is going to be for biblical soundness.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.520]   No, the mission is clear.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   There is no debate.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.140]   No matter what denomination, no matter what church,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.700]   there is no debate because Jesus makes it crystal clear.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.080]   The mission of the church is the Great Commission.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.020]   We talked about that last week.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.480]   In the context of sharing the gospel that Jesus is preparing his disciples
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.840]   to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.980]   because they're the first ones who's going to come attack you.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.520]   Don't live in fear of them.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.380]   If you're going to fear anybody, fear God.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.800]   Because he cares for you.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.660]   Because he loves you.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.340]   And when you begin to go proclaim this good news,
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.500]   and the opposition comes,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.440]   whether it's in the synagogues, the rulers,
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.640]   or those in authority,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.060]   he said, the Spirit of God is going to tell you what to say.
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.460]   So it was all in the context of preparing for the Great Commission.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:17.660]   Then all of a sudden, it seems like there's a sudden change in verse 13.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.180]   He said, the crowd, somebody in the crowd says to him,
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.440]   tell my brother to give my inheritance.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.600]   So he begins, starting from verse 13,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.640]   the message about wealth and about inheritance
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.520]   and about how we ought to be careful.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.580]   And it almost seems like that he's changing direction.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.480]   That now he's done with the Great Commission,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.340]   now he's going to be talking about wealth and inheritance.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.460]   But if you observe carefully,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.260]   I think we're going to come to the conclusion
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.640]   that probably the reason why this is in there,
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.500]   in this context,
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.480]   is because one of the greatest reasons
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.460]   why people do not evangelize
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.620]   is because of the same reason of this man,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.720]   because of what we allow ourselves
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.180]   to covet in our hearts.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.480]   The very nature of the word Great Commission, good news.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.000]   You can't say, I have good news.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.220]   I have great news.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.640]   I have this news that saved my soul,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.820]   that all mankind is dependent upon the work of Christ.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.500]   And then to say that, and then to not to share it,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.700]   it wouldn't make any sense.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.360]   It is only consistent to somebody who says,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.160]   I believe this great news,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.040]   that their salvation found in no other name
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   except for Jesus Christ.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.120]   To say that, to believe that, to sing that,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.420]   to teach that to our children,
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.600]   and then to not to share it.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.380]   What is the reason?
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.520]   Especially in the Western culture,
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.300]   where, and I don't know the exact number
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.200]   because I've seen it go up and down,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.360]   but it's never gone more than 5%.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.120]   They said, at best,
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.060]   5% of professing Christians
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.360]   regularly share their faith.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.700]   5%.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.240]   There's a lot of people who are very in the church
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.960]   about community, about right doctrine,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.180]   about we're going to do this,
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.560]   and training, and discipleship.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.860]   But the very core of the mission of the church
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.580]   is to go make disciples.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.600]   So if you do all of that,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.900]   and you're not engaged in a great commission,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.280]   it's like, I believe in the good news,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.340]   but I'm not really committed to sharing the good news.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.440]   I believe it's good news.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.080]   I believe it's the best news,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.760]   but I'm not necessarily committed to sharing this good news.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.180]   Why is that?
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.880]   Why do so few Christians
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.740]   actively engage regularly
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.280]   in sharing this good news?
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.940]   I believe that the core reason behind it
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.400]   is the same reason why this man
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.000]   is asking the question that he's asking.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.960]   We are concerned about our safety,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.880]   our comfort, and security.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.440]   We don't want to rock the boat.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   We don't want to create an environment
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.660]   where I'm going to feel awkward at work.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.900]   We don't want to create an environment,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.180]   what if they don't receive me?
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.300]   What if they don't believe me?
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.600]   They're going to think I'm weird.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.380]   And so we're going to end up forfeiting something
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.580]   because we end up sharing the gospel.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.600]   So for our safety, for our comfort,
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.000]   we kind of are timid or we make excuses
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.200]   and say, well, the opportunity has not been given to me.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.800]   Or maybe I haven't been trained.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.280]   It's the church's fault
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.220]   because they don't train me to evangelize.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.880]   I remember the first time I met the Lord,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.060]   I knew nothing about evangelism,
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.940]   but all I remember is I have to tell my friends.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.500]   I have to tell my friends.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.940]   If God is real, I have to tell my friends.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.320]   We come up with all these excuses,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.580]   but at the end of the day,
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.900]   the reason why this is relevant
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.080]   is because I believe that this is the main reason
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   why the Great Commission
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.240]   is not being actively pushed through.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.500]   We're afraid that we're going to lose our comfort.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.440]   We're afraid that we're going to lose our security.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.640]   We're afraid we're going to lose
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.200]   some of the things that we covet in our hearts.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.600]   Let's look at this text.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.320]   Let's look at the request that he's making
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.260]   in chapter 12, verse 13.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.280]   Someone in the crowd said to him,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.800]   meaning that this crowd is the same crowd
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   that Jesus was speaking to in the previous passage.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.240]   He didn't go to another village.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.960]   He's not talking to a different group of people.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.280]   It's in the same crowd where Jesus is warning them
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.240]   about living in fear,
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.260]   about he who denies me before men,
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.420]   that they will be denied before the angels of God.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.540]   It's the same crowd that probably heard this.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.680]   He said,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.280]   Teacher, tell my brother
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.880]   to divide the family inheritance with me.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.760]   Now, we first look at it,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.280]   and because of the way Jesus responds to him,
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.480]   we assume that maybe he's doing something wrong.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.040]   But it doesn't mention the context of this.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.260]   Most likely, what is happening here,
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.060]   according to Jewish law in Deuteronomy,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.260]   the firstborn, firstborn male,
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.740]   gets two-thirds of the inheritance,
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.240]   and then the one-third gets distributed.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.140]   Whether they have three brothers or 15 brothers,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.260]   the one-third gets distributed to the others.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.000]   But the firstborn is given two-thirds.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.540]   So the likely scenario in which this is happening
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.580]   is the father probably passed away,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.420]   the oldest brother received the inheritance,
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.080]   and maybe he's hoarding it to himself.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.620]   He's not giving it to them.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.580]   So on the surface,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.000]   it looks like this is unfair.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.460]   Maybe this is injustice.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.540]   And he's been trying to get this resolved,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.740]   but he can't get it resolved.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.840]   And so he sees Jesus,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.560]   this teacher,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.480]   and said,
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.740]   maybe this is an opportunity
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.240]   that I can get him to help me.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.860]   Now, him asking a rabbi to help him,
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.420]   like, tell my brother to give me an inheritance,
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.720]   is not unusual.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.240]   Because at that time,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.260]   the Jewish community,
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.960]   they were not well integrated
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.160]   into the regular society.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.200]   So the Jewish community lived centered around the synagogue.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.040]   So I mentioned this before.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.880]   The synagogue was the center of
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.400]   not only their religious life,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.480]   but the economic life.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.820]   And that's where they got their education.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.100]   People would often get married in the synagogue
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.680]   and have their celebration at the synagogue.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   So the leaders of the synagogue
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.180]   basically had authority
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.820]   over all many different aspects of their life.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.360]   So my guess is this man
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.680]   seeing the authority of Jesus,
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.000]   saying,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.800]   Rabbi, teacher,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.740]   tell my brother,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.500]   tell my brother to be fair
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.880]   and give me the inheritance.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.800]   He's trying to use Jesus' authority
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.340]   to basically correct something
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.060]   that may have gone wrong.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.980]   As a pastor,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.400]   especially when our church was younger,
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.420]   I would hear different conflicts
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.540]   or certain things being done,
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.600]   and then every once in a while,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.060]   I would hear my name being thrown around.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.220]   And saying,
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.200]   Pastor Peter said this.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.180]   Pastor Peter said that.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.040]   And I said,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.000]   I don't remember saying that.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.860]   I don't remember saying any of that.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.380]   And I remember,
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.800]   sometimes they'll use
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.900]   certain things I say,
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.200]   and they said,
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:48.520]   okay,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.360]   if they say Pastor Peter said it,
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.840]   then if you go against me,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.960]   you're going against Pastor Peter.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.020]   Right?
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.580]   And I can tell you stories after stories,
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.520]   so after a while,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   I kind of have to make sure.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:58.840]   Like,
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.440]   I have to make my communication clear.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.520]   Right?
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.900]   I'm not saying this.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.740]   I'm saying this.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.560]   Did you hear me?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.240]   Don't repeat what I said.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.320]   Don't use my name to go
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.220]   and tell people
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.120]   and then force people
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.340]   to do something that you want
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:11.960]   in my name.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.920]   My guess is,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.580]   this is kind of
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.380]   what's going on here.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.620]   He feels some level of injustice
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.180]   and maybe if this rabbi,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.860]   this teacher,
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.200]   he threw his authority
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   behind what I'm saying,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.560]   then I can get what I want.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.340]   But the issue with
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.520]   what he is asking
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.920]   is not what he is asking
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.140]   because this is not unusual.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.120]   This is not a request
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.040]   that would have been unusual
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.160]   to ask a rabbi.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.960]   What is unusual
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.020]   is the context
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.000]   in which he's asking
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.240]   because Jesus is not
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.600]   a regular rabbi.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.940]   Remember,
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.160]   this crowd
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.200]   is gathering together.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.180]   So many of them,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:48.980]   it says that they were
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.960]   stepping over each other.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.780]   There were myriads
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.480]   upon myriads.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.260]   Thousands upon thousands
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:53.800]   are gathering
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.140]   because of what reason?
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.300]   Because they liked
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:56.780]   his teaching?
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.820]   Yes.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.540]   Because of his miracles?
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.720]   Yes.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   But all of that,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.240]   the conclusion was
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.040]   he must be that Messiah.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.220]   they've been talking
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.500]   about him for centuries
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.660]   that when he comes,
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.380]   he's going to restore
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:13.960]   all things.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.740]   And so now,
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.100]   after all the things
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.740]   that he's done,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.740]   they pretty much concluded
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.380]   he has to be.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.580]   Every sign that was necessary
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.380]   for him to confirm
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.120]   that he's the Messiah,
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.880]   it must be him.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.820]   That's why this crowd
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.460]   was gathering.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.780]   So the context
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.660]   of them asking,
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.500]   it was not a typical
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.380]   rabbi
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.380]   that he was talking to.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.120]   he was talking to
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.140]   who he believed
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.200]   to be the Messiah.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.400]   The reason why
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.200]   this was an issue
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.880]   is considering
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.520]   who Jesus is.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   Considering he had
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.520]   an opportunity
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.680]   to have the audience
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.540]   of the Messiah
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.860]   in front of him,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.420]   the thing that was
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.660]   pressing in his heart
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.960]   is to tell my brother
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.920]   to give me my money.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.720]   That's what was
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.380]   the most important
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.120]   in his heart.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.320]   I just read recently
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.800]   that there was a man
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.620]   who paid $19 million
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.900]   to sit with
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.840]   Warren Buffett.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.520]   $19 million.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.600]   If you don't know
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.440]   who Warren Buffett is,
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.300]   he's probably
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.400]   the most successful
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.240]   stock picker
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.120]   of our generation
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.900]   outside of
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.060]   some congresswoman.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.120]   He's been
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.260]   the most successful
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.140]   stock picker
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.200]   of our generation.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.780]   And so
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.660]   they're paying $19 million
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.000]   hoping that sitting.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.960]   Can you imagine
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.740]   what that conversation
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:35.940]   was?
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.260]   I mean,
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.320]   obviously that man
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.940]   is already a wealthy man.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.560]   Right?
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.660]   I mean,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.800]   he can afford $19 million
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.480]   for a meal.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.580]   It wasn't because
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.500]   the steak was great.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.340]   Right?
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.120]   What do you think
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.220]   that he was asking him?
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.580]   Do you think
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.080]   he sat there
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.420]   and said,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:51.920]   you know,
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.400]   I'm having some
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.020]   marriage issues.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:53.920]   Right?
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.420]   Can you tell my wife
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.360]   to stop nagging me?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.000]   Right?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.320]   Do you think
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:57.940]   that was the
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.220]   gist of the conversation
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.520]   or say,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:37:59.680]   oh,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.340]   my children
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.080]   are in rebellion
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.580]   and so,
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.160]   these are pressing issues.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.440]   Right?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.420]   These are things
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.760]   that,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.820]   you know,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.400]   any parent,
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.220]   any husband
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.740]   would want.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.540]   But do you think
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.100]   that that's what
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.660]   he was asking?
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.600]   That $19 million meal
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.780]   was giving
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.060]   some life advice
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.140]   on some decisions
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.580]   that he's going
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:19.880]   to make?
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.040]   We don't need
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:22.380]   to know.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.300]   We already know
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.960]   why he paid
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.560]   $19 million.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.880]   Because this man
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.260]   has the greatest
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.000]   stock picker
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.740]   of our generation.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.360]   So if he paid
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.960]   $19 million,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.100]   my guess is
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.560]   he's hoping
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.400]   that $19 million
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.020]   investment
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.720]   may turn into
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.800]   billions of dollars.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.240]   Take some of
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:37.720]   his advice.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.300]   How do you know?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:38.980]   How do you pick this?
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.040]   What do you do?
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.660]   When do you sell?
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.460]   When do you not sell?
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.220]   How do you know
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:42.740]   if this company
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.260]   is worth it?
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:43.840]   When do you
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.780]   endure all of this?
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.840]   My guess is
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.500]   he came with
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.880]   tons of questions
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.900]   just to ask him.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.760]   Hoping that maybe
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.620]   some information
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.040]   that he's going
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.720]   to get from him
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.120]   is going to lead
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.460]   to maybe billions.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.220]   That $19 million
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.040]   compared to
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.220]   maybe some stock
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:58.820]   he's going to pick
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.160]   and he's going
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.560]   to put in
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.280]   $100 million
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:00.940]   is going to
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.700]   double, triple.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.340]   It is not
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.380]   what he was asking.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.820]   It is
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.020]   this question
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.880]   revealed what was
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.480]   in his heart.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.360]   He's standing
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.440]   before the Messiah
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.500]   that people are
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.160]   stepping over
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:14.540]   each other
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.200]   to get to him
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.340]   and we can
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.000]   understand why
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.780]   if he's the Messiah.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.060]   And of all
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.560]   the things
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:20.980]   that he could
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.780]   have asked him
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.640]   of all the things
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.180]   that was pressing
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.780]   in his heart
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.440]   he stands
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.180]   before the Messiah
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.560]   and said
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   can you tell
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.520]   my brother
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:28.980]   to give me
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.460]   my money?
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.760]   In John 4.10
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:32.960]   it said
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.540]   Jesus answered
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.220]   and said to her
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.420]   to the Samaritan woman
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.560]   if you knew
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.300]   the gift of God
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.060]   and who it is
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.820]   who says to you
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.760]   give me a drink
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   you would have
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.360]   asked him
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.040]   and he would have
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.540]   given you
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.300]   living water.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.280]   This is in the context
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.340]   of John chapter 4
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.580]   where he asked
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.720]   a Samaritan woman
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.420]   give me a drink
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.800]   of water
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.400]   and then she said
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.200]   well why would
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.780]   you ask me
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   a Samaritan
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.060]   you know
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.000]   a Jewish rabbi
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.420]   and he said
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:54.940]   if you knew
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.760]   who I was
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.520]   you would be
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.440]   the one asking me.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.960]   In Psalm 2.8
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.220]   it says
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:01.880]   ask me
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.760]   and I will surely
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.560]   give the nations
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.360]   as your inheritance
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.640]   and the very ends
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.080]   of the earth
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.260]   as your possession.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.600]   Think about
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.220]   the content
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.800]   of our prayers
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.260]   often.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.780]   We're praying
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.760]   to God
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.200]   who created
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.160]   the universe
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   the universe
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.340]   just by
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.320]   his speech
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.720]   everything
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.120]   is made
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.920]   it by him
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.780]   for him
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.820]   everything
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.380]   is held
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.860]   together
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.960]   because of him
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.500]   and so we
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.260]   come before him
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.280]   and think carefully
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.040]   about the content
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.960]   what's so urgent
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.760]   in our hearts
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.000]   and when we examine
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.720]   it we see
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.140]   that we're not
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:36.900]   that far away
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:37.540]   from this man
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.320]   of all the things
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:40.840]   we could have answered
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.140]   he said
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:41.960]   ask him
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.680]   and I will give you
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.300]   nations
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.000]   I will give you
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.640]   inheritance
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.460]   the end of the earth
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.000]   to your possession
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.180]   because only he
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.380]   has the capability
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.940]   authority
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.540]   and the power
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.040]   to give that
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.940]   because he's God
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.980]   and we stand
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.020]   before this God
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.240]   and so much
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.680]   of our prayer
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.240]   it's not because
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.920]   God doesn't care
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.140]   he said he cares
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:40:59.940]   about every hair
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.820]   on our head
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.300]   every strand of hair
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:02.980]   he said he cares
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   about us that much
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.580]   but we have an audience
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.360]   with an almighty God
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.840]   and our prayer
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.460]   is often
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.320]   not much different
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:11.980]   than this man
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.580]   are you going
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.920]   to pay the bills
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   might get a job
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.680]   or pray for safety
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.800]   pray for comfort
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.360]   pray to keep us
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.620]   from any discomfort
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.260]   or rejection
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.680]   and sometimes
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.720]   the content
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.300]   of our prayer
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.080]   reveals
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.560]   what we covet
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.200]   in our hearts
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.420]   so the problem
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.260]   of this question
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.620]   is not
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.400]   it was a very
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.240]   normal question
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:38.920]   regular question
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   that many people
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.020]   probably ask
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:41.960]   many other rabbis
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.120]   but in considering
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.820]   that this man
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.480]   probably came
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.000]   to the conclusion
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.360]   already
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:46.880]   that this was
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.360]   the Messiah
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:47.940]   and that's
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.280]   what he was
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.900]   going to ask
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.920]   that's why
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.760]   the response
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.320]   to the man
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.140]   Jesus says
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.840]   who appointed
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.520]   me judge
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.520]   or arbitrator
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.380]   over you
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.700]   it's another way
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.060]   of saying
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.740]   why do you
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.500]   involve me
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.960]   of all the things
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.520]   that you've seen
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.120]   me do
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.040]   he can
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.540]   open eyes
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:07.980]   to the people
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.600]   who are blind
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.200]   he can walk
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:09.780]   on water
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.500]   he can raise
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:10.760]   people
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.480]   from the dead
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.980]   why do you
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.600]   involve me
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.140]   in this
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.680]   there are
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.320]   many different
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:16.820]   channels
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.280]   that he could
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:17.580]   have gone
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:17.720]   through
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.140]   maybe he could
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:18.420]   have taken
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:18.880]   him to court
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.640]   maybe he could
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:19.820]   have gotten
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.380]   other family
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.260]   members involved
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.260]   but maybe
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:22.760]   Jesus was
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.300]   the easiest
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.640]   way
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.500]   how much
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:26.960]   of the content
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.580]   of our prayer
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.040]   do we bring
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.440]   to God
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.240]   because maybe
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.340]   the easiest
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:30.840]   way is if
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.320]   he just snaps
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.740]   his finger
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.380]   and just fixes
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.220]   in John
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:36.800]   chapter 2
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.180]   4
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.700]   Jesus says
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.040]   this to
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.420]   his own
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:39.780]   mother
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.000]   they run
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.380]   out of the
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:41.600]   water
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.000]   the first
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.320]   miracle
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:42.980]   that happens
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.020]   is Jesus
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.700]   mother comes
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:44.980]   and say
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.320]   Jesus
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.200]   they ran
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:46.700]   out of wine
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.020]   can you
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:47.320]   help
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.680]   and Jesus
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.040]   answers
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.400]   and woman
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.020]   what does
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.640]   that have
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:49.900]   to do
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.360]   with us
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.940]   my hour
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.880]   has not
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.580]   yet come
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.380]   in other
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:54.580]   words
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:54.980]   it's another
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.500]   way of saying
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.100]   why do you
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:56.860]   involve me
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.760]   do you not
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.280]   know why
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:42:59.860]   I came
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.380]   it is not
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:00.880]   time
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.520]   so he
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:02.960]   turns to
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.520]   the crowd
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.880]   and he's
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.320]   trying to
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.920]   teach something
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.960]   very very
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.180]   significant
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.740]   very very
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.300]   significant
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:11.880]   this
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.940]   this thing
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.320]   that's in
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.900]   this man's
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.180]   heart
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:14.660]   needs to be
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.120]   addressed to
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.480]   the whole
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:15.900]   crowd
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.440]   so he
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.800]   turns to
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.240]   the crowd
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:17.680]   and he
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.020]   gives this
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:18.500]   parable
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.300]   and beginning
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:19.620]   of this
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:19.920]   parable
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.200]   he says
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.800]   beware
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.320]   and be
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.140]   on guard
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.620]   two
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.420]   imperatives
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.380]   back to
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.740]   back
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.920]   remember
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.700]   we always
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:27.940]   say
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.240]   if you
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:28.420]   see
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:28.740]   anything
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.140]   repeated
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:29.460]   in the
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:29.740]   Bible
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.160]   that
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.280]   is
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:31.480]   for
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:31.620]   the
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:31.880]   purpose
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.080]   of
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:32.520]   emphasis
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:32.920]   today
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.200]   if we
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.400]   want to
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.680]   emphasize
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.140]   something
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.520]   you just
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:34.920]   highlight
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.140]   it
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.600]   bold it
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:35.760]   you
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.500]   put arrows
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.440]   on it
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.480]   emojis
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:40.960]   or whatever
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.380]   you put
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:41.680]   on it
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:41.860]   it's like
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.320]   this is
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.820]   I love
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.180]   you
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.460]   we have
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.040]   many ways
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.420]   to express
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:46.620]   that
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.220]   in the
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:47.500]   biblical
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.160]   times
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:48.900]   anything
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.300]   that must
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:49.460]   be
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:49.880]   emphasized
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.360]   it is
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:50.840]   repeated

[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:57.760]   attention
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:57.960]   is
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.080]   that
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.400]   Jesus
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.340]   when
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:43:59.660]   God
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:43:59.860]   is

[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.440]   it was
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.700]   meant
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:04.980]   for us
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.480]   to stop
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:05.840]   and take
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.360]   a look
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.280]   that of

[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.200]   this is

[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.560]   quiet time
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.100]   before God
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:56.540]   the sea
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.040]   came out
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.000]   but you
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:58.560]   feel perfectly
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.080]   you know
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:02:59.840]   mentally you
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.220]   feel guilty
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:00.580]   but there's
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:00.880]   no sense
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.440]   of urgency
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.320]   but as
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.300]   soon as
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.040]   as soon
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:05.900]   as there's
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.320]   some money
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:06.740]   missing in
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.100]   your bank
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:07.460]   account
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:07.760]   or you
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.060]   made an
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.480]   investment
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:08.840]   and the
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.040]   stock
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:09.600]   goes down
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.160]   oh my
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:11.680]   gosh
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.320]   the world
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.740]   is falling
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.100]   apart
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.780]   I need
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.200]   prayer
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.120]   I need
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:16.400]   to do
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:16.760]   something
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.120]   I need
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:17.340]   to get
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.900]   this right
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.160]   it gives
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:20.640]   you false
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.040]   sense of
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:21.560]   security
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.860]   it gives
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.520]   you superficial
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.400]   happiness
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.900]   that the
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.700]   desires of
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.160]   this world
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:28.720]   is no
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.780]   different than
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.160]   drug
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:31.800]   you take it
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.080]   for that
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.460]   moment
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.040]   and the
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.380]   fruit of
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.700]   that does
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.120]   all this
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:35.500]   damage
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:35.860]   but for
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.360]   that moment
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:36.640]   you're
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.000]   happy
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.720]   it gives
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.140]   you false
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:39.680]   sense of
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.280]   happiness
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:40.900]   false sense
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.740]   of priority
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.820]   if God
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.440]   would satisfy
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.060]   my coveting
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.120]   then maybe
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:48.600]   I would have
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.340]   enough ease
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:49.920]   and comfort
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.820]   and time
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.220]   to be able
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:51.620]   to really
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:51.960]   pursue
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.340]   God
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.020]   if God
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.400]   would only
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.340]   first satisfy
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.180]   my coveting
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.040]   so it gives
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.580]   false sense
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.140]   of priority
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:58.580]   and it gives
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.060]   false sense
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.740]   of identity
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.480]   that when you
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.660]   have money
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.160]   you say oh I
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:04.760]   was so smart
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.160]   I made some
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.700]   right choices
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.200]   I bought the
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:06.640]   house at the
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.180]   right time
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:07.740]   and I invested
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.200]   in this
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:08.680]   and I bought
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.060]   crypto way earlier
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:10.700]   when nobody
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.160]   knew
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.880]   and so it gives
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.300]   you a false
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.340]   sense of pride
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.080]   I said I did
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.680]   I know how to
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.040]   do this
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:16.520]   and you guys
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.100]   should do this
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.020]   or it
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.520]   doesn't work
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.000]   out and you
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.440]   don't have
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.060]   money and all
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.440]   of a sudden
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.140]   it's like what's
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:22.620]   wrong with me
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.240]   everybody's so
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:23.780]   smart I'm
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.220]   worthless and so
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:25.580]   it gives you
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.100]   false sense
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.740]   of identity
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.480]   and all of
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.040]   these things
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.320]   are deception
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.640]   our identity
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.040]   what we pursue
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.540]   all of it
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.200]   because we
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.260]   have accepted
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.760]   constant coveting
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.460]   in our heart
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.320]   Matthew 6
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.120]   19 to 21
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:41.760]   do not store
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.320]   up for yourselves
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:42.920]   treasures on
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.300]   earth where
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:43.980]   moth and rust
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.060]   destroy where
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:45.720]   thieves break
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.300]   in and steal
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:46.960]   but store up
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.400]   for yourselves
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.980]   treasures in
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.620]   heaven where
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.240]   neither moth
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:49.820]   nor rust
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.420]   destroy and
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.100]   where thieves
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:51.600]   do not break
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.500]   in for where
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.140]   your treasure
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.780]   is there your
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.480]   heart will be
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.800]   so the natural
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.520]   question is where
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.340]   is your heart
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.480]   where is your
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.940]   heart where do
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.440]   you find the
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.020]   greatest joy
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.440]   if you want to
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:04.940]   know if you
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.860]   want to carefully
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.080]   examine if all
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.920]   other sins
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.760]   stem from
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.040]   coveting has
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.020]   coveting hardened
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.720]   your heart
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.280]   where is your
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:15.600]   joy
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.300]   what causes the
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.000]   greatest angst
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.620]   in your life
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.680]   feeling spiritually
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.180]   dry
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.400]   not having a
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.020]   sense of urgency
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.640]   in prayer it's
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.340]   been years since
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.160]   I really prayed
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:30.900]   before God but
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.260]   somehow that you
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:32.920]   can live in perfect
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.720]   peace away from
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.900]   God but as soon
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.100]   as something that
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:36.720]   you're coveting
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.660]   that you don't get
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:38.300]   and all of a
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:38.720]   sudden your
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.640]   life gets turned
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.180]   upside down
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.460]   where is what
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.220]   causes the joy
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.500]   what causes the
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:43.980]   angst in your
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.820]   life what do
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.360]   you look forward
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:45.780]   to in the
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.720]   future what do
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.140]   you look forward
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.940]   to do you look
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.880]   forward to eternity
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.500]   or do you look
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.460]   forward to if I
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.500]   put up money away
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.060]   that I'm going to
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:53.560]   have enough money
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.420]   to take a vacation
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.140]   and do this I
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:55.760]   can if I do
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.820]   this I will save
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.620]   money and I can
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.220]   buy the house that
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:58.960]   I want what are
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.620]   you looking forward
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.420]   to what has

[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.000]   heart what are
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.100]   you sacrificing for
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.020]   even the world
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.360]   sacrifices people
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.000]   will pack their
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.580]   bags and they
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.260]   will walk into
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.240]   dangerous places in
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.020]   the world thinking
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:12.640]   that if they make
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.620]   their sacrifice now
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.700]   maybe five or ten
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.200]   years from now
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.160]   they'll find gold or
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.800]   treasure or their
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.360]   business is going to
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   go crazy so even
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:19.980]   the people in the
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.880]   world will sacrifice
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   because they think
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.260]   there's going to be
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.140]   some payoff what is
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.020]   the payoff what is
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.800]   the payoff that you're
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.620]   waiting for what are
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.300]   you willing to
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:34.420]   forsake what are you
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.240]   willing to forsake
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:35.860]   in order to gain
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.840]   what you get
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.220]   you have to ask
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.860]   yourself I know
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.880]   plenty of people
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.100]   are doing fine in
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:44.820]   their faith and all
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.540]   of a sudden they
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.260]   get tempted they
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.060]   covet something and
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:47.560]   they're willing to
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.000]   drop their their
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.040]   spiritual life their
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.820]   church their
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.660]   surrounding it's
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.060]   because I covet that
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.680]   and because we allow
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.020]   this respectable sin
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.440]   this subtle influence
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.480]   in our heart coveting
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.200]   in our heart that we
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.820]   make decisions based
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.660]   upon coveting and
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.460]   sometimes even we're
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.440]   not aware of it
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.460]   1st Timothy 6 9
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.280]   through 10 but those
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.060]   who want to get rich
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.020]   fall into temptation
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.860]   and a snare and many
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.020]   foolish harmful desires
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:16.960]   which plunge men into
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.340]   ruin and destruction
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.820]   this respectable sin
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.000]   that that everybody
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.640]   struggles with it leads
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.980]   to ruin and destruction
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.200]   for the love of money
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   is the root of all
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.960]   sorts of evil the love
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.200]   of money isn't love
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.780]   of green paper the love
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.560]   of money is love of
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.040]   security love of ease
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.960]   love of pleasure
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.440]   it's the root of all
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.840]   sorts of evil and he
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.280]   says some by longing
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.460]   for it have wandered
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.500]   away from the faith and
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.700]   pierced themselves with
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.260]   many griefs so let me

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.920]   really wanted and you've
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.820]   allowed it to dig deep into

[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.780]   gonna it's like a man who's
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.940]   been starving all day and
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.160]   then he's walking around in a
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   buffet saying I'm not gonna
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.980]   eat in fact I'm not even
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.100]   gonna be hungry I'm not gonna
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.400]   be hungry you may you may try
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.980]   real hard to not to eat but
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.160]   you can't you can't get rid
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.040]   of the hunger right so sooner
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.120]   or later the hunger is gonna
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.260]   cause you to slip fall down
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.100]   especially where the mashed
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.180]   potato is and then your mouth
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.080]   is gonna be open when you
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.000]   fall and then oops right how do
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.960]   you get rid of this company
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:26.280]   here's how here's how when you
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.620]   covet something greater than
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:32.300]   that it overpowers the
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:37.500]   previous company Paul says in
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.400]   light of the surpassing knowledge
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.720]   of knowing Jesus Christ it
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.780]   became rubbish it became rubbish
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.640]   because he was comparing with
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.820]   something else much greater
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:49.160]   because he was confronted with
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.220]   God's glory he lived all his
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.140]   life coveting to be recognized
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.860]   as being holy and righteous and
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.320]   kept the law all because he
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.820]   coveted status he coveted
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.740]   self-righteousness and he
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.780]   sacrificed imagine how much work
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.340]   went into keeping the law all
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.520]   because he was coveting but in
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.400]   light of meeting Christ everything
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.500]   else became rubbish you don't just
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.060]   fight coveting by hard will by
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.660]   discipling somebody it's like I'm
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.960]   gonna disciple you so you're no
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.900]   longer hunger for this world I'm
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.160]   gonna set you an example how you
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.380]   until his desire changes
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.540]   discipleship all it is is shaming
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.200]   him shaming him to change his
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.140]   behavior until your desire has
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.880]   changed and the only way your
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.040]   desire changes is if you begin to
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.920]   covet what is good that you begin to
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.300]   hunger and thirst for his
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.900]   righteousness that you are seeking
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.500]   his approval and that's why he
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.360]   says what what changes that is
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.840]   worshipers people worship in spirit
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.260]   and in truth are people who have
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.020]   changed their desire where their
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.500]   pleasure their life their coveting is
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.560]   God that's why Paul says in
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.300]   philippians 312 not that I ever obtained
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.220]   it or have already become perfect but
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.540]   I press on so that I may lay hold of
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.680]   that for which I also was laid hold of
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.820]   by Christ Jesus brethren I do not
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.500]   regard myself as having laid hold of it
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.240]   yet but one thing I do forgetting what
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.640]   lies behind reaching forward to what
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.600]   lies ahead I press on toward the goal for
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.660]   the prize of the upward call of God in
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.040]   Christ Jesus he said I have not I have
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.840]   not taken hold of it yet he's not
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.740]   talking about salvation of course he's
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:39.120]   not talking about salvation he said he
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.100]   was given Christ he said I desire to
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.880]   suffer and fellowship with him because I
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.560]   desire him more than anything else his
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.920]   eyes became open to his glory and as a
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.060]   result of that he said I'm going to
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.640]   forget everything everything that I've
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.520]   been coveting everything that I've
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.100]   allowed into my heart I'm going to now
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.860]   covet Christ even if it causes me
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.120]   suffering I press on toward that goal
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.680]   this is why coveting is so dangerous
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.640]   because it keeps us from coming to
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.120]   Christ and that's why a Christian is
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.760]   somebody whose eyes have been open to
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.520]   the glory of the gospel a non-christian
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.240]   is somebody whose eyes are still closed
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.980]   to the glory of the gospel and so when
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.460]   they look at the world that's what they
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.180]   want because they haven't seen Christ
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.860]   they haven't seen Christ this is why
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.660]   we study the Bible not so that you can
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.300]   be knowledgeable so you can you can
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.740]   test and see what's wrong and what's
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.220]   right it's like oh ultimately he says
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.060]   what what did Jesus say you to search
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.740]   the scriptures to see thinking that
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.360]   there's life in there when all of
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.220]   scripture was about me was to reveal my
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.300]   glory so that you can see my glory and
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.500]   in the light of my glory all other
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.840]   temptation you'll be delivered from to
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.000]   deliver us from this empty way of life by
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.180]   showing us who he is let me finish with
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:10.120]   this Psalm 27 verse 4 and I pray that
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.500]   this would be our prayers one thing I have
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.700]   asked from the Lord that I shall seek that
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.560]   I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.440]   the days of my life to behold the beauty
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.280]   of the Lord and to meditate in his temple
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:38.460]   father help us help us to be untangled with
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.080]   the coveting for this world open our eyes
