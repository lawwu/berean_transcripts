[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.280]   (soft piano music)
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:57.760]   - All righty.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600]   Good morning, church family.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.360]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280]   In Psalm 92, it reads,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360]   "It is good to give thanks to the Lord
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.660]   "and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.560]   "to declare your lovingkindness in the morning
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.120]   "and your faithfulness by night.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.140]   "With a 10-stringed lute and with the harp,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.180]   "with resounding music upon the lyre.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.980]   "For you, O Lord, have made me glad by what you have done,
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.280]   "and I will sing for joy at the works of your hands.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.120]   "Amen."
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   (soft piano music)
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.880]   We're gonna begin our worship by singing a song,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.300]   "It is Good to Praise the Lord."
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.220]   (soft piano music)

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   Welcome to Friend Community Church.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   And I'm sure as some of you guys may have already noticed
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.800]   as you're coming in to find parking,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   the Ortho parking lot that's on the corner
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   of Mitchell and Red Hill,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.320]   it's one of the bigger ones that we've been using
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.160]   for a while.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.200]   The church, the building was sold
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.480]   and they have new owners in there.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.000]   And so we need to figure out a way to renegotiate
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.840]   the exchange that we have between them and us.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.640]   And for the time being, that parking lot is shut down
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.000]   until further notice.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.440]   So when you come in, we encourage you
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.280]   to use all the other lots.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   If you are a family with small children,
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.960]   again, the lot behind us is reserved for you.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.120]   So it may be a little bit tricky to go find it
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.840]   for the first time, but there is plenty of parking there
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.120]   that a lot of the parents have not utilized yet.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.360]   And so if you're looking for parking
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.240]   and you have small children,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.040]   that's the first place we'd want you to park.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.800]   And then obviously across the street.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.880]   And we have plenty of parking.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.680]   If you drive around, you'll see.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.880]   Especially if you're gonna park and then get shuttled here,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.800]   we have more than enough parking for that.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.520]   But again, for the time being, the Ortho parking lot,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.440]   again, at the corner of Mitchell,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.160]   at the end of the street and Red Hill,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.640]   that will be shut down for the time being.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.920]   We are trying to communicate with them,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.120]   but we don't know if that's gonna open up again.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.960]   So just give you a heads up on that.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   Babysitting, there's a new ministry that's starting
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.680]   and the name of it is babysitting.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.360]   So this is a new name that I forgot who came up with,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.440]   but very clever.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.220]   So it's babysitting, but it's babysitting.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.480]   So those of you who have children,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.240]   one year to 17 months before you send them
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.440]   to the Seeds Ministry for babysitting
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.120]   and program that they have there.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.020]   But in order for us to have space
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.480]   and so that the program that they're running
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.880]   for that service, they're gonna target some of the older kids
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.320]   who are able to participate.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.280]   So babysitting ministry is gonna be happening
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.580]   starting from March 3rd.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.400]   Okay, sorry, is it March 3rd?
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   Yeah, March 3rd.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.320]   So not this Sunday, but then Sunday afternoon.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.760]   And it's relevant only to this service, okay?
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.080]   And so if you have children that age,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   between one and 17 months, you drop off the kids over there
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.060]   and they'll be, volunteers will be out babysitting.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.220]   They've already carpeted the floor,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.820]   so it's cushiony, so it's not on solid ground.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.240]   And so they're gonna be decorating
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.260]   and getting that room ready.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.840]   So it's not this, it's coming Sunday,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.340]   but Sunday afterwards, that ministry will be open, okay?
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.720]   Then obviously after 17 months,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   they'll be coming to the Seeds Ministry after that.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.760]   Old Testament Survey, as I already mentioned,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.920]   on March 3rd, for six weeks,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.360]   Pastor Peter Chung is going to be leading our church
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.100]   in the study of the Old Testament Survey.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.000]   And if you haven't taken that class
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.320]   or you need a refresher on the general outline
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.280]   of how the Old Testament is put together
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.760]   and how it relates to the New Testament,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.880]   that's a class I strongly recommend you to take.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.440]   And so please sign up for that,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.500]   and that's starting on March 3rd.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.680]   Again, on March 9th, 9 a.m.,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.160]   we have an all-church cleaning maintenance day.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.720]   So the more people sign up, the quicker it'll go
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.000]   and more we're able to clean the church.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.520]   And I know that, you know, we've had a lot of questions.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   I got a church our size, wouldn't it be better
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.320]   if we just hired janitors to do that?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.620]   But I think there is a benefit.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.060]   It's not because of finances,
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.100]   but there is a benefit for the church
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.940]   to take ownership of the church that we're attending,
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.760]   that even though our church is a certain size,
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.300]   it would be beneficial to have,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.660]   I think it's beneficial for our church members
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.140]   to take ownership of the building that we're using.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.740]   And so if you're able to come out,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.420]   we highly encourage you to come and help us clean.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.900]   That's happening on March 9th, Saturday at 9 a.m.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.580]   And then one last announcement.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.520]   If you are part of the FAM 245,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   and this is a ministry for young couples
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.680]   who've been married for three years or less,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.360]   there is a men's hiking fellowship
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   that's taking place on March 9th from 7.30 to 1 p.m.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.940]   And they're gonna be reviewing the design,
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.360]   divine design for marriage from MacArthur, John MacArthur.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.160]   And then the fellowship is gonna center around that topic
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.320]   and they're gonna be going hiking, having fellowship.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.120]   And so if you're a part of that ministry,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   please sign up for that with our brother, Jason Choi.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.020]   All the other announcements, I'm just gonna refer you
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.380]   to our website and to our app.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.620]   But let me pray for us for the offering.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.860]   Again, if you haven't transitioned to Subsplash,
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.260]   we wanna encourage you to do that.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.500]   We're gonna keep the Zelle open for just a little bit longer,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.980]   maybe about a month longer,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.580]   to give you more time to transition.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.820]   And if you choose not to,
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.460]   you can always bring a physical offering
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.920]   that you can bring in the back.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.940]   But again, it will only be open for a little bit longer
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.900]   to give you a little bit more time to transition.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.980]   But let me pray for us and give you an opportunity to give,
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.640]   and then we'll enter into the main worship.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.480]   Let's pray.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.460]   Father, we've gathered here together
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.780]   to corporately worship you, Lord God,
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.340]   with our brothers and sisters.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.600]   Help us to give you what is sincere in our hearts,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.980]   not simply our time, not simply out of obligation.

[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.460]   Why did John ask the question?
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:30.460]   Why aren't more people asking, seeking, and knocking
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.460]   that we also may follow the path of Christ?
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.460]   Let's pray.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:53.460]   Father, you are worthy of our praise.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:59.460]   More than simple lip service, but our very lives.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:04.460]   Help us, Lord God, to confess and to believe and to practice
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.460]   that we have been crucified with Christ.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:15.460]   It is no longer us that live, but Christ living in us.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:20.460]   Help us, Lord God, that that may not be empty confession,
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.460]   but it would be our very lives, Lord.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   As John gave his life preparing for Christ's path,
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:36.460]   call us, Lord God, as you have planted the church,
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.460]   that the gates of Hades would not be able to prevail against it,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.460]   that we would not live our lives in mediocrity,
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:48.460]   that we would be a community fully convicted of this truth,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:53.460]   that wherever you lead us, that we would follow and glorify you.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.460]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
