[00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:23.500]   Thank you.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:53.480]   Thank you.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:23.460]   Thank you.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:53.440]   Thank you.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:23.420]   Thank you.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:53.400]   Thank you.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:43:23.380]   Thank you.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.340]   my brethren to come to Christ and you could see the passion that he had and then second Timothy
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.720]   2 10 says for the reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen so that they also
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.640]   may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory so I remember when I was
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:46.480]   young in ministry and actually it was before I entered into ministry I prayed to God that he
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.360]   would give me brokenness for the lost because I knew what he was calling me into and I didn't know
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:59.180]   if I can do this unless he really gave me a heart for the lost right like how am I going to endure
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:06.320]   what I saw my parents endure if if it's just out of obligation and so I remember praying earnestly
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.860]   every time we had a prayer meeting I would pray God give me a brokenness for the lost let me let me
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:17.720]   genuinely cry out for them and I remember God opened my eyes and started giving me compassion for them
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:24.160]   and in this one particular day I was driving in my car and I was in the middle of traffic and I was
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.540]   watching all of these people and all of a sudden hit me like a ton of bricks the majority of these people
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:35.400]   are going to be judged when they die and I remember just being broken over that thought and coming before
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:41.840]   the Lord in prayer and then that kind of led me to pray earnestly to evangelize whatever I preached
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:48.680]   and that is what compelled me to enter into ministry but now that I've been in ministry for so many years
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:57.020]   you know it's easy to see my heart get hearted and that this is something I've done for 35 plus years
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:03.540]   and so one of the things that I I'm genuinely asking for is for prayer for brokenness because
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:11.820]   otherwise at at this stage of my life I can just ride whatever we have we have church things are going
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:19.900]   great bills are paid but obviously that's not why we're here like I want to continue to do the work
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:25.860]   that God has called us to and uh and again I know the difference between just doing the work versus
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.900]   genuinely being broken for the lost so that's my first prayer the second prayer is to have a sense of
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:39.160]   urgency to spread the gospel like I said because our church has been around for 28 going on 29 years
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:46.400]   I've been in ministry another uh seven eight years above that and maybe a bit more than that
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:54.120]   that sometimes because we're not a church plant and that there is no sense of urgency yes we need to
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:59.480]   preach the gospel we need to build a healthy church but um second Thessalonians 3 1 it says
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.200]   finally brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord would spread rapidly and be glorified just as it did
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:14.460]   also with you and I was meditating on that while we were out in Korea and I confess yes I want to spread
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:22.780]   the gospel I want to know people to come to Christ but is there a sense of urgency am I aware of the time
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:29.180]   limit that I have that you know that's why the psalmist says I'm praying that you would help me to number
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:37.460]   my days so that you would give us give me a heart of wisdom and so to have a sense of urgency to see the
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.360]   lost come to Christ so that I don't live my life thinking I have all the time in the world when my
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.140]   kids are you know this or when my bills are paid or when we have more time but really be able to see if
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:55.220]   Christ comes you know in the near future you know am I living in a way where I'm not going to look back and
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:01.800]   say oh I wish I had another year or five years or ten years and so again in Colossians 4 3 to 4 says
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.620]   praying at the same time for us as well that God will open up to us a door for the word so that we
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.720]   may speak forth the mystery of Christ for which I also have been in prison that I may make it clear in
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:19.060]   the way I ought to speak and I think about Apostle Paul how in such a short period of time he literally
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:24.460]   poured his life out to preach the gospel and he was able to plant all those churches and then when he
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:31.040]   finally died he died in the context of trying to get the gospel out right sometimes you can get so
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:37.180]   caught up in our families and you know do we have enough money are we raising godly children and and all
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:44.020]   of these things are necessary and important things but sometimes that becomes the main primary thing that I
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:50.820]   commit to and not realizing that the ultimate call for every Christian and even raising our children is in the
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:59.060]   context of the Great Commission and so my prayer is that God would give me a sense of urgency that we don't just
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:04.840]   be satisfied you know everything's going well at church the church is still growing but to really be able to see the
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:11.020]   world through God's lens and that there would be a sense of urgency in my heart to spread the gospel as rapidly as
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:18.460]   possible and I do want to spread the gospel but I need to have a sense of urgency and I want our church to
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:25.660]   have a sense of urgency to preach the gospel and then third and finally a love for the church right and
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:32.300]   it's not because I don't love the church but I know the difference between working for the church caring for the
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:39.740]   church but genuinely loving the church Galatians 4 19 20 my children with whom I am again in labor until
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:45.580]   Christ is formed in you but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone for I am
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:53.820]   perplexed about you and even as he is writing this letter you know Corinthians Galatians you know so many
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:00.780]   of Paul's letters are written because he's addressing an issue but considering how many churches he planted
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.980]   you would think he would just kind of shake off the dust and then move on and say you know I got so much
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:14.940]   other work to do but he really labored and prayed because he genuinely cared for them and you know I
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:21.100]   again you know I'm going to share but first that's only one two to three pauses we give thanks to God
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.020]   always for all of you making mention of you in our prayers constantly bearing in mind your work of
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:34.220]   faith labor of love and steadfastness of hope right again work of faith but do I have labor of love
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.700]   and I as I examine my own heart
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:47.580]   because I've been in ministry for so long for at least many years that I have you know a lot of memories
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:57.500]   some are very good and some are very bad and as a result of that I catch myself sometimes like
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:02.860]   deliberately hardening my heart I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm going to end up
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:12.300]   experiencing what I experienced in the past and so because of that I can do the work but I resist loving
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:19.500]   right I catch myself saying I don't want to love because if I love I put myself in a place where I'm
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:27.340]   vulnerable and if I'm vulnerable and I'm allowing myself to be in a situation where something some bad
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:32.780]   very painful memories in the past you know I don't want to experience that again and so I catch
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.020]   myself sometimes deliberately keeping people at bay
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:47.420]   I can't do ministry that way I want to be able to be an extension of Christ
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:53.980]   and so this is something that I wrestle with you know and like there's a temptation in my heart to
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:00.700]   just ride this out to the end you know and hopefully nothing bad happens and I'll just I'll just do the best that I can
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:10.380]   until my time to retire comes but you know I'm not here to do a job I'm here to be an extension of
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:19.660]   Christ and I can't do that if I can I can't share his heart I can't share his love and so I catch myself sometimes deliberately
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:26.380]   keeping myself at bay for that reason and so that's my prayer that's not something that I can turn on and off
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:35.580]   that's something that I have to pray that God would allow me to to be an extension of who he is to the church as well not just to
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:45.580]   the lost in fact it's easier for the lost because the lost you just share the gospel and you celebrate and then you move on but it's much
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:51.500]   harder to love the church because we share our lives together we rub shoulders together you know we
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:57.580]   you know anyway I don't want to take too much time but if you can take some time to pray for me specifically
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.540]   that I've been wrestling over my own heart
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.860]   right I want to see the gospel spread but
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:09.820]   I have to be a vessel that God can use and so that's something that I I wrestle with and ask ask for your your prayer

[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.860]   good
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.660]   good evening church
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:37.900]   uh
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.700]   first I want to say
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.900]   um
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.100]   how grateful I am
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.140]   to be standing up here to share my prayer request with you
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.900]   um
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.900]   I stand amazed at our God who
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   showed me such grace
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.140]   um
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:54.540]   um
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.020]   not only has he ransomed my wretched soul
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.300]   but he has grafted me into his body
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:06.460]   and given me an extended family within the church where I could stand before you and
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.140]   share my prayer request with you asking you to
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.900]   shoulder some of the burdens that we have as pastors and
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:19.180]   and we're truly fulfilling the law of Christ as we do that
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.340]   I'm so privileged and thankful that
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.660]   I have hundreds of saints
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.780]   praying for me praying for the pastors here
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.140]   um
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.300]   and we're just so privileged and thankful for that
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.100]   um
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:38.460]   having said that the first prayer request that I have is for discernment to lead the college ministry
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.260]   um
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.620]   I had never imagined myself overseeing the college ministry
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.460]   um
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.300]   if I'm being honest with you this evening
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:54.140]   I felt a bit timid when Pastor Peter told me that I will be assigned to the college ministry
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.380]   Pastor Nate
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.220]   he has done such a wonderful job with this ministry
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:05.100]   that I felt that the standard was set really high
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.940]   and so
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:12.620]   the fear of coming short of expectations and disappointing others
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.700]   it often plagued my mind
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:21.500]   and that had to do with the fear of man that had to do with me wanting to please man
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.580]   and so those thoughts often plagued my mind
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:28.860]   and I have to constantly remind myself that
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.940]   God did not give us a spirit of fear or timidity
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:39.100]   but of power and of love and of discipline and that I should fulfill my ministry
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:44.700]   as one who has been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.900]   speaking the word of truth not as pleasing men
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.940]   but God who examines our heart
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.860]   and so I have to keep reminding myself of that truth
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.740]   since I've been in college ministry
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.020]   I'm very fortunate to be
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:05.500]   surrounded by an amazing team of staff and student leaders
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:12.460]   they have helped me tremendously as I transitioned into college ministry and I'm very grateful to God for them
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.740]   I'm also thankful to our college ministry
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:23.260]   all our students made me feel really welcome and made the transition very smooth and
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.980]   they have accepted me in
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:30.940]   and I know this because prior to going to retreat few of the
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:36.860]   college students approached me and asked me if it would be okay for me to room with them at retreat
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:42.620]   and so I kindly declined because I told them I have to room with my wife
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:49.020]   but you know that made me feel welcome and I and I truly appreciated that
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.940]   but you know
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:59.180]   having inherited this amazing ministry I do ask the Lord to give me an understanding mind to oversee his people
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:05.660]   that I may discern what is right and wrong and to exercise faithful oversight of God's people
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:12.300]   because I know that I have been entrusted with the precious souls of the Lord's redeemed people and
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.700]   and and I want to do what is right before the Lord
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:19.500]   and so if you could pray for me that I'll have discernment to lead the college ministry
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:25.580]   and secondly diligence in prayer and reading scripture amidst a busy schedule
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:31.100]   so summer system has begun and with the quarter system approaching
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:39.260]   college ministry will continue to be busy and um just on a side note I forgot to add it there but
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.460]   our collegians are out on campus this week and next week
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:47.900]   and we're inviting collegians to come to our welcome week event
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:54.860]   but in addition to flyering we're also evangelizing to students on campus and having been on campus with our
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   collegians
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:03.340]   I'm just so thankful to God that they have the passion for evangelism that they're being obedient to the great commission
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.980]   to go out there and making disciples
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:12.060]   and so if you could continue to pray for our collegians as they're faithfully on campus in this
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:16.940]   hot summer heat sharing the gospel that that the Lord will keep them
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:26.300]   but as the college ministry continues it's gonna get busier and so I ask that you please pray for me
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.020]   that I remain sharp and focused by the word of our God during the school year
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:41.100]   I believe like all of you here this evening that everything that pertains to life and godliness is in the inspired scriptures
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:47.500]   and so I firmly believe that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of our God
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.660]   but knowing myself
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.980]   I can get easily distracted by the task and the assignments that are before me
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.620]   I like to get things done I don't like to leave things undone
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:05.180]   and so with that kind of an attitude
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:10.060]   I can get distracted and sometimes neglect my reading and prayer time
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:19.180]   but I don't want to neglect my time and reading of God's word or or prayer and communicating with him because I know like the
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.580]   scripture says man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.380]   and so I ask that you pray for me
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.060]   that I will always make God my number one priority
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.260]   that he comes first in every decision that I make
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:39.660]   and that no matter how busy it gets I want reading scripture and prayer to be my number one priority
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.660]   and third my devotion to wife family and the church
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:51.580]   I want to have a well-balanced devotion to my wife to my family and to the church
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:56.140]   I don't want to conflate the three thinking that serving one is serving the other
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   I want to have a proper distinction of every relationship in my life and serve faithfully in each
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:07.420]   and so I ask that you pray for me that I will continue to be a faithful husband
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.540]   a faithful pastor a son a brother and a friend
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:16.540]   I remember my official first two months at Berean as a pastor
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:24.060]   I enjoyed every minute of it and I still enjoy every minute of it I love being at church
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.620]   like I love being here
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:33.740]   but one day my wife Becky told me that the transition was a bit challenging for her
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:42.860]   beginning of this year I was on my sabbatical and I'm not an easy person to hang out with
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:48.060]   and so I was home most of the time and Becky just wanted me out of the house
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.580]   so she said look go mountain bike do something just don't stay here
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:03:00.540]   and so she asked me to leave the home a few times so she could focus on her work
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.940]   because I keep bothering her every time I read a devotion I interrupt her and says look what it
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.380]   says here and she's like I'm in my meeting
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:17.100]   but since I have been at church she told me that the transition has been challenging because
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:26.140]   she misses me I know that's TMI um but she says she misses me and I and I could see her shaking her
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:32.220]   head right now but but you know I was reminded to be sensitive to the needs of my wife and not to
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:38.300]   neglect my duties as her husband because in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 it tells us husbands
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.980]   love your wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:50.220]   and so I ask that you pray for me that I'll be reminded of my role not just as a pastor at a church
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:58.540]   but a husband a son a brother and a friend and that I will show my faithfulness in every relationship in
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:12.300]   my life not to neglect my duties and so those are my prayer requests for this evening
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:27.020]   so
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:31.020]   so

[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.740]   as a first request
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:08.460]   please pray for wisdom
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:13.260]   I feel especially now in this kind of season of my life
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:17.660]   a desperate need for wisdom in every single facet of my life actually
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:24.300]   thinking about church ministry you can imagine there are a lot of just ministry plans
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.220]   what do we do about this event there are a lot of questions about what do we do about
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.820]   these people
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.860]   and more than ever
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.300]   and more than ever I feel a sense of like almost paralysis sometimes these days
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.220]   where you'll catch me just
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:41.260]   I don't know what do we do last year you know like that kind of
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.220]   just feeling stuck
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.020]   and I'm just sharing honestly that sometimes
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:51.340]   I I can't even tell like what's the issue is it just fear that plans may fail
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.980]   is it fear that if you know we deal with a certain person this way they'll hate me
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.460]   it's probably all the above
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.580]   so my prayer request actually is
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:07.580]   I don't know if just because my mind is muddy and I need more focus but I just pray for wisdom
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.060]   the kind of wisdom that fears God first
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.980]   quick to consider him
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.660]   a kind of fear that
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.100]   you know a kind of wisdom that considers the people that we're serving
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.900]   a kind of wisdom that considers what's good
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.740]   biblically you know
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:25.100]   and not just actually from experiences of the past
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.020]   not not just simply from questions of what what was good in the past and what
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:34.140]   what did we do last time but actually spiritually good and this translates
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:39.580]   immediately into a lot of the counseling that I do please pray that I would be wise
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.860]   like truly spiritually wise and the council
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.060]   I think that kind of false folly of well you're just like this person so I'm going to say to you
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:56.780]   exactly what I told this guy or something like that can can be something that I fall into as a pitfall
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:03.500]   but you know my request is that you would you would pray for a kind of wisdom that's truly
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.660]   observant of the need of the moment for each individual
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:13.020]   that cares deeply about their soul and is giving guidance that actually applies
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:16.860]   that is from the scripture that is truthful and filled with love
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:23.340]   and then in just kind of generic wisdom wise I do sometimes feel like man I
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.060]   I need wisdom just to manage myself like wisdom to manage
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.020]   my own priorities which is wisdom to manage
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.340]   what focus should I have
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.500]   just as pastor sung mentioned we have
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.540]   various roles God has gifted us with
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.260]   to be a husband to have that role and have the ambition of
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.260]   building up a healthy family
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:53.980]   and just out of just sheer distraction or lack of focus sometimes you know those things can really
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:58.140]   fall by the wayside so my prayer request is first and foremost for this
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.900]   that I would have a sensibility where I can have my eyes open
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:07.100]   I'm alert and I could feel and know the need of the hour okay
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.540]   the second request that I have is my parents
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:14.300]   more and more I'm concerned for them
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:25.100]   my father's reaching into maybe I think is 83 my mom's close there and I can hear just more and more of
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:33.420]   you know their own angst because they're both lonely they're they're both physically experiencing difficulties
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.980]   and then but my request for me is
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:40.300]   sometimes I hear it and I'm just like okay
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.660]   and then I don't know what to do you know
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:48.620]   my prayer request is that I would have an ambition to be as a faithful son
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.660]   to minister to them to the best of my ability
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:56.300]   to be present for them and it's weird because I am the youngest I'm
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:00.300]   giving them life advice is like hard
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:07.340]   I talk about you know fear of the words you say and fear of how how to be of encouragement
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.500]   but I have concern for their faith I I want them in their later years to actually have assurance
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:19.260]   I want them to be strong in faith and then yet sometimes honestly speaking
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.100]   I am pretty scared to speak to them you know so
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:28.940]   my prayer request is for boldness and faithfulness as a son to minister to my parents
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.140]   and then finally as you guys know I'm a youth group pastor
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.260]   and I have been so challenged by the youth group students because
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.700]   lately I've been seeing so many youth group students come close to understanding gospel
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:45.100]   a lot of youth group students are giving their lives to Christ and and being converted
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:49.020]   and in the midst of that my prayer request is that God would use me
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.060]   I'm on the pulpit with our teachers regularly
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.620]   but my two sons are sitting there within the congregation of our of our youth group
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:01.820]   and they're looking at me you know and sometimes I look at them and because
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.500]   I don't want to get distracted I look away
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:10.220]   but I too again within this kind of circumstance want to have the courage to speak boldly into their lives
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:17.500]   but my prayer request for that specifically is obviously they see me at home and I want to be such an example for them
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.180]   it's my fantasy
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.820]   to where
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.020]   it's me
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.900]   I can be the one preaching to them
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.820]   I can be the one talking with them and praying with them holding their hands
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.740]   and they repent
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.060]   and they come to salvation
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:40.300]   um
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.860]   they they're blessed
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:47.180]   like many of the children all the children here so blessed
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.460]   to receive instruction to receive the teaching
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.900]   to be so close to godly individuals all around
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.460]   so then my worst fear
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.980]   is to be so close but then so far
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.580]   right so
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.260]   um
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:10.780]   please pray that God would use me and my wife to be that shining light of glory for my boys
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.580]   thank you
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.580]   thank you

[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.300]   um
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:53.340]   moving
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:53.500]   moving
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.100]   moving on from college ministry
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.660]   and then
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.420]   moving into the band ministry
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.700]   um
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.220]   there's so much similarity
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.040]   so much that is
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:02.700]   the same
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.900]   uh
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.980]   because
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:06.260]   at the end of it
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:06.540]   uh
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.180]   what I
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.060]   would desire
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:08.540]   uh
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.600]   in our church at large
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.080]   would be
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:10.620]   uh
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.440]   for God to be
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.220]   glorified
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.180]   but I remember
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:14.500]   uh
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.100]   early on
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.200]   as I was thinking about
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.100]   BAM and praying
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.020]   uh
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.740]   I was trying to
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.620]   understand again
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:19.860]   what
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.620]   what does it mean
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:21.920]   like what would that look like
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.160]   and
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.100]   the prayer
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.560]   that I would have here
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.100]   is
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:27.540]   uh
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.760]   like as I'm thinking about
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.320]   every event
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.420]   Bible study prayer meeting
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.420]   to be oriented around
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.460]   the desire for God's glory
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.500]   um
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.360]   that
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.440]   that last part there
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.640]   is actually what I would like
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.900]   you to pray for me
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.440]   if you can
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.660]   I know that this means
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.260]   that in my heart
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:40.920]   and desire
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.140]   needs to first be oriented
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:42.800]   around the desire
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.380]   for God's glory
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.060]   in my own life
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.320]   uh
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.560]   what would that mean
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.040]   when
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:47.260]   when
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.280]   when I desire
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:48.780]   for God
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.720]   to be glorified
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.540]   in the ministry
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.160]   in BAM
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:52.960]   um
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.160]   if I am not
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:54.880]   living a life
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.680]   that is glorifying
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.060]   God
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:56.900]   in my home
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.220]   um
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.020]   if I am not
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.480]   uh
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.340]   if I'm not jealous
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.280]   for God's glory
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.220]   um
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:02.960]   if I'm not
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.460]   hungering
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.140]   for God
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.000]   to be glorified
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.100]   uh
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:07.640]   that's something
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:07.940]   that
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:08.420]   that really
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.120]   can't be hidden
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:09.420]   in a way
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:09.880]   that can't be
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.120]   something
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.640]   that I could
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.460]   just kind of do
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.420]   um
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.200]   in order for
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:13.740]   for me
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:14.380]   to be able
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.060]   to be a pastor
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:16.800]   to this church
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.480]   it means
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.240]   that my desire
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.000]   can't just be
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.640]   for our church
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.500]   to glorify God
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.280]   it means first
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:22.840]   that I need
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.640]   to glorify God
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.160]   and for me
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.360]   to glorify God
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.180]   means that I need
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:27.840]   to desire
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.540]   God's glory
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.240]   and so
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.080]   if you can pray
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   that I would have
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.900]   a jealousy
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:33.820]   for God's glory
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.180]   in my conversations
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:35.840]   with people
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.780]   that uh
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.900]   that my number one
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:39.680]   desire would be
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.060]   for God
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.720]   to be honored
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.880]   not just
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.640]   for things
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.100]   to look
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:44.460]   the way
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:44.880]   they're supposed
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.400]   to look
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:45.820]   but
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.340]   that I understand
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:47.900]   like God's
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.320]   heartbeat
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.220]   something
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:50.980]   specific
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.520]   you can pray
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.200]   for is
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   that
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.000]   that I would
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.720]   engage
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.300]   in things
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:55.700]   that
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.900]   bring God
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:57.620]   glory
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.220]   again I know
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:58.600]   that sounds
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.240]   very similar
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.140]   but
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.040]   if it would
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:01.500]   help to put
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.080]   it this way
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.020]   I don't want
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:03.820]   to enjoy
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:04.560]   things that
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:04.940]   would bring
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.860]   God dishonor
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.740]   I want to
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:07.540]   only enjoy
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.120]   things that
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:08.680]   would bring
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.200]   God honor
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.080]   and I want
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.600]   to cultivate
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.240]   those things
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:11.920]   in my life
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.400]   in my free
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:13.740]   time
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:14.200]   and in my
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:14.800]   desires
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.560]   so many times
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.320]   I don't actually
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.140]   know what's
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:18.440]   best
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.300]   people ask me
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:19.660]   when I
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.560]   when I came
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:20.940]   into BAM
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.240]   a lot of
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:21.660]   the BAMers
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.160]   were asking
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:22.560]   like oh
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.160]   what like
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:23.740]   what do you
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.100]   envision
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:24.920]   for the ministry
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.380]   and I say
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:25.620]   like oh
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.080]   I want God
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:26.920]   to be glorified
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.380]   and then
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.000]   from there
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:29.340]   I'm like
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:29.560]   God
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.400]   what do I
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:30.720]   do
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.380]   like what
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:31.640]   does that
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.160]   look like
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:32.560]   how do I
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:32.980]   go about
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.260]   it
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:34.420]   and so
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.060]   please pray
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:35.620]   that
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.620]   that in
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:37.140]   my own
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:37.440]   life
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.100]   my desire
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:38.760]   for God's
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.260]   glory would be
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:39.540]   high
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.180]   secondly
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:41.800]   if you could
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.240]   pray
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.780]   that I would
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.500]   not be a
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.320]   people pleasing
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.120]   people fear
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:46.880]   but a God
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.600]   pleasing God
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:47.920]   fear
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.240]   in many
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:50.740]   decisions
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.180]   there's a
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:51.500]   temptation
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.120]   to function
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:52.520]   off of
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:52.860]   people's
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.220]   opinions
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:53.640]   but at
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:54.020]   the end
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:54.560]   I answer
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:54.900]   to the
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.060]   Lord
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.360]   I want
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:56.720]   to be able
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.080]   to listen
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:57.440]   to people
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:57.780]   and address
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.060]   what I
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:58.220]   can
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:58.500]   but not
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.060]   be swayed
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.260]   in my
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:23:59.720]   faithfulness
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.000]   to the
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:00.220]   Lord
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.520]   and so
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:01.920]   in essence
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.260]   I want
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:02.480]   to make
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:02.620]   sure
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:02.880]   that I'm
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.140]   the same
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:03.380]   person
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:03.800]   with you
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.120]   that I
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:04.260]   am
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:04.780]   before God
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.240]   first
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.500]   that
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.240]   temptation
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:09.960]   is heavy
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.120]   and it
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:12.680]   doesn't always
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.660]   look the way
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.200]   I thought
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:14.580]   it would
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:14.980]   look
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.720]   that desire
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.280]   to
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   be liked
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.200]   and appreciated
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.840]   in those
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.800]   places where
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.440]   like the
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.020]   counseling
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:24.440]   and the
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:24.860]   teaching
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:25.320]   that needs
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:25.760]   to come
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.260]   is
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.260]   sometimes
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:28.660]   there's a
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:28.940]   lot of
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.460]   dissonance
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:29.740]   there
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.640]   and so
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:30.820]   if you
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:30.940]   could
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.300]   pray
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:31.620]   that
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:31.820]   my
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:32.140]   fear
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:32.320]   of
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:32.560]   God
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:32.740]   would
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:32.920]   be
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.400]   genuine
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:33.940]   and
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.480]   it
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:34.680]   would
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.080]   happen
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:35.380]   not
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:35.740]   because
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:35.920]   I
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.260]   know

[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   I'm
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   to
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   I'm
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   to
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   I'm
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   to
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   I'm
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   to
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.400]   I'm
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:27:59.400]   to
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400]   I'm
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:00.400]   to
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   I'm
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   to
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   I'm
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   to
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   I'm
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   to
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   I'm
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   to
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.400]   I'm
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400]   to
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400]   I'm
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.400]   to
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.400]   I'm
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   to
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.400]   I'm
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   to
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:42.380]   I don't know.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:29:12.360]   I don't know.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:42.340]   I don't know.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:30:12.320]   I don't know.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:42.300]   I don't know.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:59.820]   Okay, if I can get you guys into groups of four, okay?
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:04.280]   If you can just turn around where you're at, you can come to the front and sit in the front if you want.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:10.360]   But if I can get you guys into groups of four, then let me share the four prayer requests we have for this evening, corporate prayer.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:15.480]   And then after a time of prayer, our praise team is going to come up and he's going to finish us.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.120]   We're going to finish up the thing.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:23.980]   So can you turn around, grab four people around you, and when I see you in your groups, then we'll share the four prayer requests.
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:36.220]   If you're cramped, if you're cramped, you can come up to the front and sit in the front if you want, if you have good backs.
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:56.560]   Okay.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:56.780]   Okay.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:07.780]   If you want more space, you guys can just come up to the front.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:08.620]   There's plenty of seats.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:09.660]   You can sit on the ground.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:10.860]   Okay.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:17.740]   All right.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:25.480]   So there's five things out there, but number one is basically we'll give you some time to share your prayer requests with the people with you.
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   And then number two, we're going to pray for the upcoming college students who are coming into town.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:37.560]   Just like Pastor Sung mentioned, the semester schools are already starting.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:45.540]   And I guess obviously you guys know that every year when that time comes around, we have an influx of students that are coming in.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:50.420]   And, you know, a lot of the students who are coming in grew up in the church, but they're not Christians.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.100]   And so it's a great opportunity to share the gospel with them.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:56.640]   I know that the college group is actively engaged.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:04.460]   Pastor Nate is trying to engage our BAM and other parts of our ministry to be aware that it's not just like college student coming.
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:08.140]   These are souls that are coming into our church, many of them who do not know Christ,
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.540]   that we would have the mindset of evangelizing and sharing the gospel with them.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:17.600]   So if they're lost, they don't know Christ, they're coming to church because maybe their parents are sending them.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:23.820]   But again, we always get an influx of non-Christians coming into church so that our whole church will be mindful of that.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:24.900]   Number two.
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.880]   Number three, pray for our upcoming Bible study in Genesis.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:33.380]   That home group, small group leads for spiritual fervency to appoint the members to Christ.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:37.260]   And I know that the schedule, you know, having a time at break was great.
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:43.920]   But through the Bible study that our church may be thoroughly equipped and to grow as a church,
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.980]   and especially for the home group leads and the small group leads, that God would use them.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.860]   And not to be fatigued, but really be able to use this opportunity to build a healthy church.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:56.960]   And then number four, pray specifically for the unbelievers in your life.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:03.220]   It's hard to pray for people who we don't know if we're not praying for the people that we already know.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:07.540]   So identify who they are if you get some time to pray for them.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:13.100]   And then finally, as you guys have been seeing, every update that we get now,
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.280]   every update that I post on our church Facebook page, there's some sort of beating.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.360]   So those of you who know, who've been to India, you know who Pastor David is, not Pastor Sake, but his younger brother.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.060]   He was beaten in the village that he went to, so they asked for prayer for him.
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.020]   And so this is a regular occurrence happening in India.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.560]   So we are headed out there again in January.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.360]   But if you can pray for our pastors, Pastor, if you know them, those of you who've been there,
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.600]   know them by name, please pray for them and their children.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.520]   We did drop off some money so they can buy some land, so they can build a school,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:54.320]   so that the pastor's children could be educated because, again, that funding is being blocked by the local Hindus.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.620]   And so if you can pray specifically for the pastors who are there and for their ministry and their wives and children as well.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.500]   So those of you guys who remember, last year when we went, while we were there,
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:10.300]   like a day or two before we showed up, while Pastor Sake was out doing ministry out in the villages,
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:14.980]   he was gone for about a week, radical Hindus came and tried to burn the house down.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:20.540]   And so she didn't feel safe while we were there, so she had to be moved somewhere else
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.980]   because Pastor Sake was going to be with us.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:28.580]   So persecution has been increasing, but it's becoming more and more intense
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.180]   because everything that they do, the police aren't doing anything about it,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.380]   so they're much more emboldened than they were before.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:36.980]   So if you guys can please pray for them, okay?
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:41.500]   So let me give you guys some time in your group to divvy up the prayer request.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:42.520]   Take some time to pray.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.240]   In about 10, 15 minutes, we'll call you back, and our worship team will lead us,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.380]   and then we'll close up in prayer, okay?
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:52.500]   So, okay, let me take some time to pray for each other.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.460]   And again, you have about 15 minutes, and I know it's not a long time,
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.960]   but take about 15 minutes to pray, and then we'll get back together, okay?
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:28.940]   Thank you.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.940]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.260]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:37.980]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.900]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.760]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.160]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.400]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.660]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:49.200]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.800]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.800]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.800]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.800]   I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.800]   I know it's not a long time.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   I know it's not a long time.

[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.800]   But as far as our part,
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.800]   I'm going to pray for us
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.800]   and then we're going to sing our final song.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.800]   And then again, if you want to stay longer
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.800]   to pray with your group,
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:34.800]   you're welcome to do that.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.800]   So let me pray for us
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.800]   and then our praise team is going to lead us off.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.800]   Father, we thank you so much for giving us this evening
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:43.800]   for us to pray.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:45.800]   I know, Father, that more than anything else
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.800]   that we can engage in,
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.800]   to know, Father, that our crying out to you,
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.800]   our prayer, Father God,
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.800]   is more powerful than anything else that we do.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.800]   help us, Lord God, to be constantly humble before your throne.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.800]   Help us to know, Father, that you have called us
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.800]   to be a light in this world,
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.800]   that we would not live our lives centered on our needs
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.800]   and our desires and our wants.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.800]   Help us, Lord God, to truly be able to pray
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.800]   that your name may be glorified,
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:13.800]   that your kingdom come,
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.800]   your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.800]   Help us, Lord God, to see the lost as you see them,
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.800]   that you had so much compassion, Lord God,
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:26.800]   that you allowed your son to be sacrificed for our sins.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:29.800]   Help us, Lord God, that that would never become mundane.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.800]   Help us so that that would never become simply a memory,
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.800]   but that it would be the source of our strength.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.800]   It would be a source of our worship, our fellowship, our love,
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:41.800]   and our compassion, Lord God, for the lost.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.800]   Help us to know the gift that you have given us in this church,
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.800]   that we would not simply end in satisfaction.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.800]   But I pray, Father God, that that joy may overflow
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.800]   to many people around us, Lord God.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.800]   Lord, we are living in the midst of so much suffering around us.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800]   Help us to see them.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:00.800]   Help us to cry out to them, for them.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.800]   Help us to intercede on their behalf.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.800]   Lord, I pray for the members in our church who are hurting,
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.800]   even now, of their family members that they have lost,
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:13.800]   for the many difficulties, Lord God, that they may be in.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.800]   I pray, Father God, that you would surround them with your comfort,
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:19.800]   that your presence, Lord God, would be their healing,
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:24.800]   and that we would constantly learn, Father God, over and over again,
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.800]   that you are our ultimate source,
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   that we may truly be able to find our rest in you.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.800]   So I pray that all the prayers that we've lifted up, Lord God,
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.800]   knowing that you have heard it, that we would live in faith,
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.800]   that we would be strengthened,
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.800]   and that our Sunday, Father God, this coming Sunday,
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.800]   that we would worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:47.800]   So for that end, Lord God, we pray that you would receive glory to your name.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.800]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.800]   Let's all stand up for the closing prayer.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:54:02.580]   Worthy of every song.
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:09.280]   Worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:16.040]   Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:22.780]   Worthy of every breath we could ever bring.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.660]   We live for you.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:27.960]   We live for you.
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.420]   In Jesus' name.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.540]   In Jesus' name above every other name.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:43.040]   Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:49.880]   Worthy of every breath we could ever bring.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.880]   We live for you.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:55.020]   We live for you.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:02.540]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:05.960]   There is none beside you.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.960]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.460]   And show me who you are.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:25.020]   And fill me with your heart and lead me in your love to those around me.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:37.040]   In Jesus' name above every other name.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:43.580]   Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:44.140]   Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:50.620]   Worthy of every breath we could ever bring.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:52.080]   We live for you.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:52.700]   We live for you.
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.580]   Oh, we live for you.
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:55.640]   Oh, we live for you.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:56.740]   Sing holy.
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:03.440]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:06.800]   There is none beside you.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.560]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.300]   And show me who you are.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:18.700]   And fill me with your heart.
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:26.480]   And lead me in your love to those around me.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:36.480]   And I will fill my life upon your love.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.940]   It is a firm foundation.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:49.940]   I will put my trust in you alone.
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:55.520]   And I will not be shaken.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:16.180]   I will put my trust in you alone.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:22.600]   And I will not be shaken.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.940]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:31.060]   There is none beside you.
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:36.060]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:39.780]   And show me who you are.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:43.200]   And fill me with your heart.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:50.060]   And lead me in your love to those around me.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:54.820]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.440]   Holy, there is no one like you.

[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:06.900]   And show me who you are.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:10.280]   And fill me with your heart.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:17.520]   And lead me in your love to those around me.

[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:53.420]   Okay.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:58.880]   Those of you who didn't finish, if you want to stay and finish up your prayer with your small group,
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.840]   you're welcome to do that.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:05.720]   And then if the rest of us, if some of you guys can help us put the chairs back and so we can get ready for Sunday as well.
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:09.740]   And then, so again, this room will be open for a little bit until we're done praying.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:10.340]   Okay.
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:11.040]   All right.
