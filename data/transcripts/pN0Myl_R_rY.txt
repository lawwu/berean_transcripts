[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.920]   All right.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.800]   So originally I just thought to do a chorus
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.560]   all the way through, repeat with all the instruments,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.080]   but I think what we'll do is chorus, repeat twice.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.400]   Essentially chorus one, repeat that twice,
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.280]   and then we'll die out with just my one defense,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.680]   my righteousness at the end.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   All right, let's try that one more time.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.960]   Let's go from--

[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.400]   - And then also I think there's a bridge
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.060]   for the bridge, I don't like it.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.480]   - I did, yeah, for the bridge I kinda wanted
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   like a, I don't think it's really part of the track,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.380]   but more like a low version of The Electric.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.060]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:14.380]   - All right, let's try bridge one more time.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.480]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.160]   - All right, real quick.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.440]   Noah, for the chorus two, for some reason,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.840]   it's just E and B, but I'd like to just keep it
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   the same as the first line of chorus one,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.640]   like the chord progression.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.580]   So it would be E, A, E, B.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.940]   (gentle music)
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.660]   All right, cool.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.500]   Let's take a couple of minutes
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.940]   and then we'll pray in the corner.

[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.780]   Welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.780]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   We're gonna start with our family ministry field day.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.780]   Andy Wong is gonna come up
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   and give the announcement for that.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:09.780]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.780]   This announcement is for anyone who is in family ministry
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.780]   who became a member in 2022 or after.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   You should have received an email about a week ago
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   inviting you to this family ministry field day.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.780]   So this event is gonna take place on March 22nd
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.780]   from 2 to 4.30 p.m. in Heritage Community Park in Irvine.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.780]   Your family must sign up as a team of two.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.780]   So it's either a husband or wife or a parent and child
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.780]   as long as the child is ages five or up.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.780]   And there's just one team allowed per family, okay?
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.780]   We're going to be playing some lightly competitive games,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   but the games are geared towards all ages,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.780]   whether you're in FAM 245, FIG, or Jubilee.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   There's limited space, so please sign up today.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.780]   Thank you.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.780]   - All right, just to reiterate,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.780]   it's for the newer families in the church
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.780]   who kind of want to meet some more people in the church
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.780]   to help integrate into the church.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.780]   So if you are interested in that, please sign up for that.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   Next Sunday, there's gonna be a newcomers welcome lunch
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   at 1 p.m. in the Youth Chapel.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.780]   So if you're new to the church
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.780]   and you just want to meet some of the leaders in the church
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.780]   and find out about the history
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   and the church ministry philosophies,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.780]   that's the lunch for you.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.780]   So please sign up for that,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   and that will be taking place on next Sunday
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.780]   at the Youth Chapel.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.780]   College retreat.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.780]   If you're part of the college group,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.780]   the retreat is happening on March 21st to the 23rd at Oakland.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.780]   The speaker is Eric Charbonnet from Pillar Baptist Church,
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   and the sign-up is going to be until next Sunday at March 7th.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.780]   So please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.780]   And then finally, this is just a heads-up.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.780]   VBS, if you have children who are going to be participating in that,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.780]   it's on June 23rd to June 27th.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.780]   Just mark it on your calendar so that you'll know--June 23rd, 27th.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.780]   And so they are asking for volunteers,
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.780]   whether you are going to be teaching
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.780]   or helping out with activities or cooking,
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.780]   they are asking for sign-ups for that.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.780]   So please, you need to be a member to participate in this
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.780]   for child safety training and all of that.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.780]   So please sign up for that,
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.780]   and then they'll notify you of the meetings that are coming.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.780]   I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   After I pray, again, if you are here and you have a physical offering,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.780]   we have an offering box in the back on the way out.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.780]   But after our praise time, our brother Adam Wu is going to come,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.780]   give his testimony, and be baptized this morning.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.780]   All right, let's pray.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning,
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.780]   the privilege that we have to come to the throne of grace
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.780]   with confidence covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.780]   Help us, Lord God, to never forget what it is that we have in you,
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.780]   that all that we do will simply be a reasonable response
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.780]   to the love that you've poured upon us.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.780]   Help us, Lord God, that even in this giving,
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   it would be an act of worship,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.780]   it would be an expression of our gratitude and lordship to you,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.780]   and may it be multiplied that your name may be honored and glorified
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.780]   and proclaimed wherever you send us.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.780]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:49.780]   >> Hello, church family.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.780]   My name is Adam Wu, and this is my testimony.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.780]   My mother is a Christian, and some of my earliest memories
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   are of going with her to Friday night fellowships.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   However, as I grew older, I primarily called myself a Christian
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.780]   because I was afraid of potentially going to hell.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   Often at night, after I was tired, I would remember that I still hadn't prayed,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   and I would always think, "What if this is what makes me go to hell?
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.780]   What if I otherwise would have done enough to go to heaven,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   but because of this one missed prayer, I fall just short?"
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   This would spur me to action, and I would conduct a sleepy and unfocused prayer.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.780]   This characterized my spiritual life for a long time,
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.780]   in the sense that it was mainly superstition and fear
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.780]   that caused me to call myself a Christian.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   With no personal connection or deep motivation to follow Jesus,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.780]   I didn't live my life in a way that reflected my faith.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.780]   I didn't do much more than attending church and conducting sleepy prayers.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.780]   Starting college, I wasn't completely ready to walk away from Christ,
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.780]   but I justified my lack of faith by claiming that I didn't have enough evidence.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   To me, it didn't seem like God was the most likely explanation
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   for reality and for my existence.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.780]   I heard the testimonies of others, and I saw how they had been personally experienced,
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.780]   and how they had personally experienced God.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.780]   But I didn't think that that was enough to justify his existence.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.780]   After all, people can have profound religious experiences in other religions.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.780]   I believed that the only universal and objective way to arrive at God's existence
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   was logical evidence and deduction.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.780]   With this in mind, I looked into apologetics and logical arguments
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.780]   to find a proof for God, but I couldn't find anything convincing.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.780]   Nothing I found was foolproof, enough to remove all my doubt.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.780]   Only after a long time did I realize that nothing I found
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.780]   would be enough to fully convince me.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.780]   If I was seeking satisfaction with a perfect logical proof,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.780]   I would live my life in constant indecision.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.780]   I would forever be unable to reject God for fear of hell,
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.780]   but I would also be unable to embrace him out of fear of wasting my life.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.780]   At this time, I read 1 Samuel, in which, after many years of being unable to bear children,
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.780]   Hannah desperately promises God that if he gives her a child,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.780]   she will dedicate him to God.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   God answers her prayer, and she gives birth to Samuel.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   God didn't have to part the clouds and proclaim to Hannah
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   that he would give her a child before she prayed to God.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.780]   She placed her faith in God first, and then God answered her prayer.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.780]   Even after a lifetime of wishing for this child, when many would have cursed God,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   she still held true to her belief that God existed and that he was good.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.780]   This struck me because I saw the similarity between my situation and Hannah's,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.780]   but my attitude was reversed.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.780]   I was expecting God to reveal himself to me without first opening my heart to him
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.780]   or placing my faith in him.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.780]   Together, with my earlier realization concerning the futility of logical proof,
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   I decided to place my faith in God first,
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.780]   trying my best and my earnest to search for God with an open heart.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.780]   I allowed him to speak to me through his word,
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   and I decided that I wouldn't need universal logical proof for God's existence.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.780]   Personal evidence or experience would be enough.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   The personal experience I was looking for occurred when one of my relationships fell apart.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.780]   Throughout this relationship, I had conducted myself according to the wisdom of the world
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.780]   and to my own fleshly desires.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   The result was pain and hurt for both sides.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.780]   As I reflected upon the damage that I had caused,
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   I truly realized for the first time the ugliness and evil that was sin.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.780]   The moment when I first saw myself in this way was frightening.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.780]   My actions seemed so disconnected from the good person that I thought I was.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.780]   I realized for myself the truth of the Bible,
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   how living by my rules and by my wisdom would only lead to pain and death.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   I clearly saw what separated me from God,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   and I finally knew why I couldn't be in his presence.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.780]   I felt that I deserved eternal punishment.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.780]   However, I also knew that the Bible promised that I was already forgiven for my sins.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   Jesus had already died for me and given me a path to life.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.780]   I felt relief and joy, but also confusion and guilt.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.780]   It was hard to accept my innocence and freedom from punishment.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.780]   I finally knew that only a love greater than anything I'd ever known
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.780]   would be capable of offering me this.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   I'd finally found what I'd been praying for.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   God had shown himself to me.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.780]   Through the existence of my sin,
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   God demonstrated not only his existence as well,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.780]   but also his love and my need for Jesus as Lord of my life.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.780]   Since coming to faith, my motivation is not fear of hell,
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   but appreciation and gratitude towards Jesus.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.780]   He saved me from the death that I know I deserve.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   I have repented of my sins, and although I am still sinful and wretched,
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.780]   I do not live in complacency or acceptance of sin.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   Rather, I constantly struggle against it out of a desire to imitate Christ.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.780]   As I reflect upon my testimony, I am struck by God's patience,
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   his faithfulness, and the goodness of his timing.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.780]   For so long, my heart was hardened, yet he remained.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   He was always reachable and eager to know me, good in all seasons.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   2 Peter 3.9 reads, "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   as some understand slowness.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.780]   Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish,
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.780]   but everyone to come to repentance."
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   I have a deep appreciation and gratitude that God was so patient with me,
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.780]   that Jesus sacrificed himself to present me with an alternative to eternal death.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.780]   My life is no longer my own, but I live only so that God may be glorified.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   Thank you.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:31.780]   [Applause]
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:41.780]   [Pause]
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   Do you understand that when you go into the water,
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   you are being united to Christ's death,
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   and when you come out, you are being united to his resurrection life?
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.780]   God bless you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   [Pause]
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:09.780]   [Applause]
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.780]   All right. Thank you, Adam.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.780]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 10.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   We're going to be reading from verse 25 all the way down to verse 29.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:28.780]   Luke 10, verse 25-29.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.780]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.780]   "And a lawyer stood up and put him to the test, saying,
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   'Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?'
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   He said to him, 'What is written in the law? How does it read to you?'
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.780]   And he answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.780]   with all your soul, and with all your strength,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.780]   with all your mind, with your neighbor as yourself.'
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   And he said to him, 'You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.'
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.780]   But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'"
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   Let's pray.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.780]   Heavenly Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.780]   We pray for illumination through your word,
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:13.780]   that you'd open our eyes to see who you are and what you have given us.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.780]   Help us, Lord God, to pursue you, to love you, to proclaim you,
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.780]   that your word would open up not only heaven, but our own hearts toward you.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   Bless this time, Father. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:36.780]   In Isaiah 43-4, Isaiah prophesied hundreds of years before Jesus came
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.780]   that John the Baptist, a forerunner, was going to come and prepare the way for Jesus.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   And this is what it says.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.780]   "A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.780]   Let every valley be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.780]   And let the rough ground become a plain, and the rugged terrain a broad valley.'"
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   This illustration of bringing down the mountain and filling up the valley
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   is all over the Bible, the Old and the New Testament.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   And the illustration basically is that every road that leads to Christ will be prepared.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   So this was illustrating that people who are proud, who are in high places,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   are going to be humbled, and they're going to be brought low.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.780]   And that people who are in low places, who believe that they don't deserve the grace of God,
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   that they are going to be lifted up.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   And we see this illustration all over Scripture.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:36.780]   In particular, in the book of John, John, as he is introducing Christ to people,
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.780]   begins in John chapter 3 where Nicodemus, the spiritual elite,
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.780]   comes to Christ concerned about his reputation.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   Because he already has a reputation of being a religious leader,
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.780]   possibly a member of the Sanhedrin, one of the senators.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   So this is a guy, Nicodemus, who every Jew aspired to be.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.780]   This is the guy that if somebody wanted to know how to get to God,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.780]   Nicodemus would have been one of the people that they found out
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.780]   and waited in long lines to ask him a question.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   And he comes to Jesus in John chapter 3 at night and has his encounter with Christ.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   And then Jesus says, "You must be born again."
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.780]   Meaning that everything that he's done up to this point doesn't lead to salvation.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.780]   That you have to be completely a new person.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   And then, right after that, we see him in John chapter 4
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   where he encounters a Samaritan woman.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.780]   And this Samaritan woman, during the broad daylight, is actually concerned for Jesus.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   Because she was known to be not only a Samaritan but a sinner.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.780]   And so she encounters--Jesus deliberately goes to where she is, encounters him,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.780]   and then she says, "Aren't you concerned?
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.780]   Why are you a Jewish man in broad daylight talking to a Samaritan woman?"
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.780]   Jesus actually pursues her and then reveals himself to her.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.780]   So if you look at that, it's very deliberate how John introduces Nicodemus
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.780]   and the Samaritan woman to introduce the gospel to us.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:09.780]   That a proud man is being humbled and a humbled woman is being lifted up.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.780]   And then the entrance into the kingdom of God is the same door.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   There's not a better door up in the mountains.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.780]   There's not a lowly door for those who are lowly.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.780]   But it's that the gospel basically makes the road to Christ the same.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.780]   Over and over again, we are taught, over and over again,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.780]   the spiritual pride of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the scribes, and the lawyers.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   It blinded them to see Christ.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.780]   Whenever the Bible mentions a sinner who has gone ahead of these Pharisees,
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   these religious elites, the people who are so meticulous in trying to keep the law,
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:50.780]   and Jesus repeatedly says, "The tax collectors, the prostitutes, the Samaritans."
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   Those are the three groups of people that Jesus always mentions
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   when he mentions the people in the spiritual valley.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   These are not people who are welcomed into the synagogue.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   These are not people who people just automatically thought they don't know God.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.780]   These are compromisers.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.780]   But over and over again, Jesus says to them,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.780]   that it is those that you think are blind, they're the ones who will see.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.780]   And those who think that they see, they're the ones who are blind.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.780]   We see that in Luke 10.21, when Jesus tells his disciples, after they come back,
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   that you're rejoicing over the fact that you have authority over demons,
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.780]   but he says, "Rejoice over the fact that your name is written in the book of life."
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.780]   And then he says, in verse 21, Luke 10,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.780]   that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.780]   and have revealed them to infants."
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.780]   After he tells them that, the text that we're looking at
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   gives us an illustration of what that looks like.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.780]   He says, the intelligent, the wise,
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.780]   they're the ones who are blind, and it's the spiritual infants who are going to see.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.780]   And so he introduces to us, in the next text,
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.780]   a lawyer who would be considered spiritual giants.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.780]   They were the intelligent. They were the wise.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.780]   And we see this encounter with this man, how blind he is.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:18.780]   And then his encounter with him leads to the parable of the Samaritan woman,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   a Samaritan man, where he is declared to be the righteous one.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.780]   So not only is he telling them this, he's, again, Luke is revealing to us
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.780]   that this is what this looks like, right?
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   A wise man who is blind, and spiritual infants
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   who actually are the ones who are righteous before God.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.780]   So let's look at this encounter in verse 25.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.780]   "The lawyer stood up."
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.780]   The fact that he stood up means that he wanted everybody's attention.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.780]   This was not an honest question where he's coming to Jesus and saying,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   "Hey, I have this question. Can you answer this question?
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   How do you inherit eternal life?"
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   He stands up basically to show people that this is something that,
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.780]   to put him to the test, maybe to put him in a trap.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.780]   He stands up to put him to a test.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   He's saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   We already know that this is not an honest question, right?
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.780]   There's a difference between asking a question and questioning.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.780]   I often get people who come to me, and if they're asking a question,
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.780]   whatever question that may be, it's easy to answer because I can tell you
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.780]   that these are the things that may answer your question.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   But when somebody is questioning, they're questioning.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.780]   They're saying, "Aren't you like this?" or "Why do you do this?"
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.780]   And they've already made a decision.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   They're just indicting me through question.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   You can't answer that question because no matter what you say,
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.780]   they're going to have a rebuttal, right?
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   Because they're not actually looking for an answer.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   Jesus, knowing this, doesn't answer the question, and he says,
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   "Well, what do you think?"
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.780]   It's genius. I should do that next time.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   If somebody is questioning me, he says, "What do you think?
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.780]   What do you want to say?"
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   Jesus responds and says, "What is written in the law?
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.780]   How does it read to you?"
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   And so the lawyer, looking at the opportunity to show everybody what he knows,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.780]   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   and with all your strength, and with all your mind,
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   and your neighbor as yourself."
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.780]   Now, you may look at that in verse 27.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.780]   It says, "Well, he's a lawyer, so he should know this."
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:26.780]   Actually, every Jew knew this.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.780]   This was a constant debate among the Jews, especially the scribes,
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.780]   which is the weightiest law.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   They had 613 different laws that they identified,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.780]   and they put it in order of which law is the greatest
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.780]   and which are laws that you can kind of get away with
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   if you don't take it too seriously.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.780]   Of all the laws that they debated,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.780]   it was universally accepted the great Shema
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   in Deuteronomy chapter 6, 4-5 was the greatest law.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.780]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.780]   You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.780]   with all your soul, and with all your might."
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   And then again in Leviticus 19.18, the second part of that,
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.780]   "You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people,
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   but you shall love your neighbor as yourself, and I am the Lord."
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   Again, this was not a genius,
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.780]   or this is not because he's a PhD in the law.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.780]   Every Jew would have been able to answer this question
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.780]   because the Jews called this the great Shema.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.780]   The great Shema basically in Hebrew means,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.780]   it means to listen or to hear.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.780]   The great hearing, the great listening,
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.780]   or another way to put it is the great obedience.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.780]   Of all the things that you need to pay attention to,
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.780]   you need to pay attention to this.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.780]   And so twice a day, they got in the morning and they recited this.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.780]   Before they went to sleep, they recited this.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.780]   They had it memorized, they had it posted up everywhere.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.780]   And then every night, you know, if you have young children,
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   you may be in a habit of having prayer with your children
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.780]   before they go to sleep.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   Well, this is what the Jews prayed with their children
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.780]   when they were young, before they went to sleep.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.780]   The great Shema, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one,
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.780]   And second is like you love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.780]   and they would recite this before they go to sleep.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.780]   So this was not new.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   This was not some, you know, Ph.D.
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   answering a deep theological question.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.780]   It was, "Well, what do you read?"
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.780]   And he said, "Love the Lord your God."
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.780]   So that part of it is not strange.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.780]   This is universal.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   Any Jew would have been able to answer that question.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.780]   But the question mark is in verse 28.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.780]   When Jesus hears this, he said, "You have answered correctly.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.780]   Do this, and you will live."
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.780]   Remember, that was an answer to a question,
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   "How do you inherit eternal life?"
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   If somebody asked you, "How do you inherit eternal life?
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.780]   How do I get to heaven?" and you answered them,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.780]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and soul,
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   and love your neighbor as yourself,"
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   that would be blasphemy.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.780]   That would be heresy.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.780]   What's the right answer?
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   By faith, right?
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.780]   If you confess with your mouth that Christ is Lord
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.780]   and believe in your heart that he is raised from the dead,
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.780]   then you shall be saved.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.780]   By faith, you are saved, not by works,
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.780]   not if you love God and love your neighbor.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   So if you happen to be practicing love,
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.780]   that that's your ticket to heaven.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.780]   And yet Jesus says, "You have answered correctly,
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   and now you shall live."
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   So how do we understand this?
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.780]   Why does he say this?
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.780]   Well, is it because he's now in the Old Covenant?
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.780]   In the Old Covenant, that people are saved by works?
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   In the New Covenant, we're saved by faith.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.780]   Is that why?
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.780]   Is Jesus in the Old Covenant?
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   No.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.780]   Because we are told that Abraham was considered righteous
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.780]   because of what?
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.780]   Because of faith.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.780]   So even the old saints were saved by faith,
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.780]   not by works.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   The Bible makes that very clear.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.780]   So he is not stating an Old Covenant
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   versus something in the New Covenant.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.780]   So again, how do we understand this?
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.780]   There's three things that I'm going to be mentioning.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   The second and third I'll be getting to next week,
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   and I'm going to camp on the first one.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:36.780]   And the first answer is because it is correct.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.780]   It is correct, and I'm going to get to that.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   And I'm going to share with you seven reasons
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   why this is correct,
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.780]   according to what the New Testament tells us.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   The second reason is much more personal.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.780]   He is indicting the lawyer.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.780]   You're looking for a path to eternal life,
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.780]   and you're an expert of the law,
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.780]   so if you're going to keep anything,
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.780]   you need to keep that law perfectly.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.780]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.780]   all your mind, all your strength, all your soul,
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:12.780]   not realizing that that commandment indicts him.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.780]   So Jesus is turning the table and said,
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   "If you're going to do that, you're going to have to do that."
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.780]   And then third is not just an indictment against the lawyer,
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   it's an indictment against anybody
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   who thinks that somehow by the law
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.780]   that they're going to get into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.780]   But I'll get to that next week.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.780]   Today, we're going to look at the true statement,
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.780]   when he says, "That is correct."
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.780]   That is correct. That statement is correct,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.780]   that all of this summarizes what God desires.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.780]   Love your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.780]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.780]   Number one, I told you I'm going to give you seven of them.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.780]   Number one, the reason why this is correct
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.780]   is because love is the fulfillment of all the laws.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   Love is the fulfillment of all the laws.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.780]   In Matthew 22, 38 to 40,
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.780]   is a different instance where the Pharisees come
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.780]   and ask and test Jesus, "What's the greatest commandment?"
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.780]   Let's see how well you know the law.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.780]   And Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.780]   soul, mind, and strength. Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   The second is like it.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.780]   And on these two commandments depends the whole law
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.780]   and the prophets.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.780]   All of the laws are summarized by these two statements.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.780]   Love God and love your neighbor.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   If you look at the Ten Commandments,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.780]   that's exactly how it is divided.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   The first four commandments is,
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.780]   you shall have no other gods,
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   don't make any graven images, right?
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   You shall not use the name in vain,
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   and you shall keep the Sabbath holy.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.780]   So the first four commandments is about loving God.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   Why should you not worship any other god?
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.780]   Because you love God.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   Why do you not use his name in vain?
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.780]   Because you love God.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.780]   Why do you create an image of him
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.780]   and then love an imitation of him?
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.780]   He said, "No, because we love God."
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   Why do you keep the Sabbath holy?
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.780]   Because we're dedicating ourselves to love God.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:04.780]   The first four commandments.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.780]   The next six commandments is,
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.780]   honor your father and mother.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.780]   Why? Because you love them.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.780]   Do not murder.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.780]   Why? Because you love them.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.780]   So all of the next six commandments
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   all are about loving your neighbor.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.780]   Some people, and I admit that early on in my faith,
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.780]   I thought the Old Testament was about God's righteousness
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.780]   and judgment and holiness,
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:31.780]   and the New Testament is where his love and grace is revealed.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.780]   Well, that's not the case
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.780]   because when you look at the commandments,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:39.780]   he says the whole commandment is summarized by love.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   This was not a new covenant thing.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.780]   Every Jew understood this about God.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.780]   Every Jew.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   Remember Jonah, when God sent him to Nineveh
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.780]   to tell them that if they don't repent
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.780]   that judgment is coming upon them?
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.780]   Jonah didn't want to go.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:58.780]   Why didn't he want to go?
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.780]   Why didn't he want to go?
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   Because he loved them.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:02.780]   Was he concerned that God
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.780]   was going to reveal his judgment against them?
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.780]   No.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   At the end, he said, "I knew it."
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.780]   As soon as they repented,
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.780]   "I knew you were merciful.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.780]   I knew you were patient.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.780]   I knew you were going to forgive them."
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.780]   Because they all knew this already.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   This was not a New Testament, Old Testament thing.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.780]   God is the same God of the Old Testament,
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.780]   same God of the New Testament.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.780]   And every Jew knew
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   that the law ultimately was about loving God.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.780]   Well, it's ultimately about loving their neighbor.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.780]   Galatians chapter 5, 14, it says,
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:36.780]   "For the whole law is fulfilled
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.780]   in one word in the statement,
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.780]   'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.780]   So the whole thing,
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.780]   without going into every detail,
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.780]   what God desires more than anything else is love.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.780]   Secondly, love is the foundation
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.780]   upon the covenant with God.
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.780]   Love.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.780]   The basis of our relationship with God is love.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.780]   Some people may hear that and say,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.780]   "Well, what about his holiness?"
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.780]   I remember years ago, early on in church,
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.780]   when the Young, Restless, and Reformed Movement
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.780]   was just starting to take form,
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.780]   and all of a sudden these young guys
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.780]   were coming out of the seeker-friendly church,
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   and they said, "You know what?
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.780]   The problem with the church today
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.780]   is that we don't practice church discipline.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.780]   We need to discipline people
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.780]   who are not walking right with God.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.780]   We need to call them out."
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.780]   And he was so determined.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   It's like the next stage of church,
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.780]   we need to show the iron fist
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.780]   so that they take God seriously.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.780]   And I remember talking to him, thinking,
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.780]   "I think the problem with church
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   has always been lack of love, not judgment."
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   Part of the reason why we weren't practicing
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.780]   church discipline is because of a lack of love.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.780]   Because we're indifferent.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.780]   We're indifferent.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.780]   Even if people are falling away,
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   and they may be walking away from God,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   and the reason why we don't take that seriously
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   is because we're not practicing love.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.780]   If you really loved, you'd be concerned.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.780]   If your child is going astray
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.780]   and doing something that's going to hurt them,
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.780]   you're going to get involved and say something
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.780]   that they don't want to hear.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.780]   But part of the reason why people are afraid to do that
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.780]   is because of lack of love.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.780]   It's not because of lack of iron fist.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.780]   Love never negates holiness and obedience.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.780]   John 14, 15 says, "If you love me,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.780]   you will keep my commandments."
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.780]   You can obey without loving God,
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.780]   but you cannot love God without obeying.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.780]   But the priority is love.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.780]   It is love that leads us to obedience.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   And so, Hosea 6, verse 6, it says,
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.780]   "For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice,
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offering."
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:00.780]   If you look at Israel,
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.780]   before it falls to the Assyrians,
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.780]   before it falls to the Babylonians,
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   they were very active at the temple.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   They were giving all kinds of sacrifices
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   because they conquered their enemies.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.780]   They were financially well off.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.780]   So they were coming to the temple,
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.780]   making all kinds of sacrifices.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.780]   Remember what God says through Isaiah?
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   He said, "Your sacrifices are meaningless to me."
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.780]   There are all these sacrifices that you're giving.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.780]   You're giving animals,
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   but you're not giving your heart.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.780]   Even the music that you sing,
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.780]   it says, "It's noise to me."
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   And I remember reading that, thinking,
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.780]   "God commanded them to do this,
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.780]   and yet he says, 'I detest it.'"
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.780]   Because what God desired of these sacrifices
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   was not the animals, but the heart.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   It was an avenue to express
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   their loyalty and love to God.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   Instead, they made it a checklist to do something.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.780]   I did it.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.780]   God didn't command these sacrifices
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.780]   because he loved barbecue.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   He liked the smell of dead animals,
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.780]   and so he loves barbecue.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.780]   So he said, "Make all these sacrifices to me."
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.780]   He said, "No, you're just making these sacrifices,
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   but there's nothing.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.780]   You're not genuinely repenting.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.780]   You don't care about the foreigners.
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.780]   You don't care about the lost."
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.780]   What God desired always was our heart.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.780]   The law was an avenue to show our heart,
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   but ultimately it was our heart.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:34.780]   You guys know the passage in Ephesians 5.22,
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.780]   which is a passage that's often quoted in weddings,
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.780]   where it tells us the relationship
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.780]   between husband and wife,
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.780]   and how a wife should submit to their husband,
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:43.780]   as the church does to Christ,
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:46.780]   and then tells the husband to love their wives
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.780]   as Christ loved the church.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:52.780]   Sacrificially gave his life for his wife.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.780]   But in the conclusion of everything he says,
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.780]   he says the whole reason
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   why he's giving you this illustration
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   was so that you may understand
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   the relationship that we have with Christ
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   in verse 32.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.780]   "This mystery is great,
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   but I am speaking with reference
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.780]   to Christ and the church."
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.780]   The whole reason why he gave the illustration
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   about the love relationship
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.780]   between husband and wife,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.780]   how the wife loves her husband
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   by submission and honoring him,
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.780]   how the husband loves the wife by sacrifice,
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   is what this covenant love relationship looks like,
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   so that we may have a better understanding
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   of our relationship with Christ.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.780]   What God desires of us isn't simply obligation.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   Imagine if you were standing on the altar,
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   and your vow was from this day forward,
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.780]   "I'm going to do my best
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.780]   to meet my legal obligation as a husband."
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   Right?
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.780]   And the wife's just tearing up,
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.780]   so she's so touched.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   "You're going to do your legal obligation for me?"
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.780]   Right?
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   "You're going to save money on taxes?"
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.780]   No, when you make the vow,
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   you're basically saying
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   that from this day forward,
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.780]   you're my partner.
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.780]   I'm going to leave and cleave.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.780]   That I'm going to forget about anything else
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.780]   that I was distracted by.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.780]   There's no other woman for me but you.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.780]   From this day forward,
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   you're my priority.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   I'm going to give my life
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   if it's better for you.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.780]   That's basically what a vow is,
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.780]   a covenant relationship is.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.780]   That whatever distraction,
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.780]   whatever that was priority
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:24.780]   before you met your wife,
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.780]   that that's your priority now.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   So the Bible gives us
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.780]   that that's the relationship
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   that he is pursuing,
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.780]   that he desires of us.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.780]   Not just his creation
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.780]   to bring them back into submission.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:39.780]   Not simply to people
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.780]   who are doing wrong and rebellion,
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.780]   to stop rebelling.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.780]   He's bringing us all the way
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   into the inner chamber
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.780]   to restore that covenant relationship with him.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   That's why he says to love.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.780]   In the book of Revelation,
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.780]   you have this model church,
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.780]   the church of Ephesus.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.780]   And this is what he says,
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.780]   "I know your deeds, your toil,
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:00.780]   "your perseverance,
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   "and you cannot tolerate evil men.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   "You protest to those
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.780]   "who call themselves apostles.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.780]   "They are not.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.780]   "You found them to be false,
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.780]   "and you have perseverance
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.780]   "and endured my namesake
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.780]   "and have not grown weary."
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.780]   Perfect church.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:14.780]   Especially if you're
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   in a Bible teaching church
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.780]   that do an inductive Bible study,
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.780]   memorizing scripture.
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.780]   You know the theology.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.780]   You're reading all the systematic theology.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.780]   It's like this church has it all.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:27.780]   They're testing false doctrine.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.780]   They're persevering.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.780]   They're enduring for his namesake.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.780]   They're not growing weary.
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:33.780]   They're testing even the apostles
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.780]   to make sure that they are sent from God.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.780]   And then he says in verse 3,
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.780]   "But I have this against you,
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.780]   "that you have left your first love."
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.780]   Despite all that they have,
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:49.780]   he says the primary thing
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.780]   that God is looking for
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   is that you have forsaken it.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.780]   And he says,
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.780]   "If you do not remember,
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:55.780]   "if you do not repent,
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.780]   "and you do not redo the things
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:57.780]   "that you did at first,"
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.780]   he says,
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:58:59.780]   "I will take away my lampstand."
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   Lampstand basically means his presence.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:04.780]   That his relationship with this church
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   is going to be severed.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.780]   That all the things that you are doing
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.780]   is going to amount to nothing.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.780]   This is a model,
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.780]   especially to a church
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   that takes theology seriously,
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.780]   and we want to make sure
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:21.780]   that we have the pure gospel.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.780]   But he said,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.780]   "You may have all of that,
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.780]   "and you have forsaken your first love."
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.780]   It means nothing.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.780]   In Matthew 10, 37,
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.780]   "He who loves father and mother more than me
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.780]   "is not worthy of me,
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.780]   "and he who loves son or daughter more than me
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.780]   "is not worthy of me."
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.780]   Of course Jesus is not saying,
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:40.780]   "Do not love your mother and father."
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.780]   He's the one who teaches us
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.780]   to love our father and mother.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   He's saying that first and foremost,
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.780]   our covenant relationship is with him.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   Even before mother,
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.780]   even before father,
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   even before children,
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.780]   our covenant relationship,
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   we're married to him first.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   Because our marriage to him
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   is what affects
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   how we love our mother and father
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.780]   and our children.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 16, 22,
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   Paul goes so far as to say,
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.780]   "If anyone does not love the Lord,
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.780]   "he is to be accursed."
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780]   He doesn't say,
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.780]   "Anybody who doesn't obey,
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.780]   "anybody who doesn't act right,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.780]   "he who does not love the Lord,
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.780]   "he is accursed."
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.780]   The primary identifying mark
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.780]   of someone who has met the Lord,
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.780]   he says, is love.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.780]   Love.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.780]   Then in John 20, if you remember,
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.780]   when Peter and the disciples
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.780]   fail miserably,
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.780]   after the resurrection,
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.780]   he calls them and he cooks them breakfast,
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.780]   and then he wants to restore Peter.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   When he restores Peter,
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   remember what Jesus says?
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.780]   Did he say to Peter,
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780]   "You failed miserably.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.780]   "You denied me to my face
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.780]   "three times,
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.780]   "just as I said you were going to do.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.780]   "Are you going to do that again?"
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   Peter says, "No."
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.780]   "You sure you're not going to do that again?"
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.780]   "No."
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.780]   "You better not do that again."
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.780]   "No, Lord, I won't do that again."
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.780]   Is that what happens?
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.780]   What happens there?
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.780]   He wants to restore Peter,
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:15.780]   and he says, "Do you love me
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.780]   "more than these?"
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.780]   "Yes, I love you."
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.780]   "Do you love me more than these?"
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   "Yes, I love you."
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.780]   "Do you really love me more than these?"
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.780]   "Lord, of course I love you."
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.780]   He said, "Then feed my sheep."
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   His restoration and his calling to ministry
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   was, "Do you love me?"
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   Not, "Are you going to be disciplined?"
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.780]   "Are you going to get this right?"
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.780]   He said, "Do you love me?"
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.780]   The primary identifying mark
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.780]   of somebody who is called to do ministry
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   is not their gifting,
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.780]   is not their talent,
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.780]   is not their experience,
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.780]   is not their fruit.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:57.780]   It's their love.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.780]   Because that's what he asked.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.780]   In order to prepare Peter for ministry,
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.780]   to declare who he is,
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   he had to make sure,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   "Do you love me?"
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.780]   And that is not a question
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   just for Peter and the apostle.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   That's a question for every single Christian.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   That if you are seriously
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.780]   going to follow Christ,
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.780]   the primary question that he's going to ask is,
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.780]   "Do you love me?"
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.780]   Because the primary pursuit of our God
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.780]   is a restored covenant relationship with him.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.780]   Number three,
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.780]   love is the fuel for ministry.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   Why does he say, "Do you love me?"
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:36.780]   Because love is the fuel.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   2 Corinthians 5:14,
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.780]   "For the love of Christ controls us,
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   having concluded this,
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.780]   that one died for all, therefore all die,
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.780]   considering the love that he gave me,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   and that love compels me to love."
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.780]   He writes this in the context
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   of people judging him,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.780]   questioning his apostleship.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   He's saying things that they don't like,
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.780]   and they say, "You know what, that guy,
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.780]   I don't know if we can take him seriously."
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   He put a thorn on his side,
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   agonizing before God.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.780]   He said, "Why do you endure?
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   Why do you persevere?
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   Why am I writing this letter?"
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   There's so many other cities that he can go to.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780]   It's in that context
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.780]   that the reason why I persevere
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:19.780]   and why I'm pleading with you
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   is because the love of Christ compels me.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   Because Christ loved me this way,
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   so I love you.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   Galatians 5:6,
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.780]   "For in Christ Jesus,
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   neither circumcision
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   nor uncircumcision means anything,
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   but faith,"
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.780]   what?
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.780]   "Working through love."
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   Not just faith, right?
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.780]   Not just work,
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.780]   not hard work,
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.780]   not discipline,
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.780]   not just discipleship.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.780]   He says, "Faith working through love."
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.780]   Love is the fuel.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   Love is the fuel
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780]   that causes us to labor,
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.780]   to persevere.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780]   Fourthly,
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   love is the goal.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   It's a goal of our ministry.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780]   It's a goal of our sanctification.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.780]   1 Timothy 1.5,
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.780]   after Paul tells Timothy
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.780]   to command these men
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.780]   who are teaching false doctrines,
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780]   command them
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780]   with the authority that I give you
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   and the authority that Jesus gave me,
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780]   command them
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.780]   to stop teaching these false doctrines.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.780]   But as he commissions him,
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.780]   he reminds Timothy,
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.780]   "But the goal of this instruction is love."
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   Not to expose them,
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   not to simply shame them,
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   not to fight evil
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.780]   and say, "We're going to conquer this evil."
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780]   He said, "No.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.780]   The goal of why we're telling you to fight
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.780]   is love."
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   You know, some of the most ugly things
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.780]   that we see in Christendom
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.780]   is people who are so committed to the truth
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.780]   with very little love,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.780]   thinking that as long as we have truth,
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.780]   as long as we have truth,
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.780]   that we're excused.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.780]   No, he says, "No.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   Even as we fight for truth,
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   don't forget that the goal is love
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.780]   from a pure heart,
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   good conscience,
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.780]   and a sincere faith."
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.780]   Meaning that if you're discipling somebody
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.780]   and they become very proficient in theology,
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.780]   very disciplined,
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.780]   and they know how to carry out ministry,
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.780]   they know how to lead,
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.780]   and yet they're not growing in love,
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.780]   you missed the whole point.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   The purpose of discipleship is love.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   So how do you measure
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   if somebody is growing in their faith?
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   It's like, "Knowledge?
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.780]   All of this stuff is important."
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.780]   But he says, "The ultimate goal is love."
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.780]   Are they growing in love?
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   Philippians 1, 9 through 10,
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.780]   Paul calls this Thessalonian church,
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.780]   or the Philippian church,
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   a model church in Macedonia.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.780]   Even in the midst of poverty,
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   they were begging Paul,
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.780]   "Give us an opportunity to give."
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.780]   And they were known for their love,
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.780]   and yet he says, "In this I pray
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   that your love may abound still more and more."
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.780]   Don't stop.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.780]   You're known for your love,
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.780]   but don't stop.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.780]   You have to keep going
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.780]   because this is the right path.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.780]   You're practicing love,
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.780]   but you need to do more and more.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.780]   He says the same thing in 1 Thessalonians.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   He says, "Timothy comes back
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.780]   and gives them a report
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.780]   that their faith is abounding,
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   and the evidence of this faith
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   is the love that they were practicing
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   to all the saints."
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   And then he tells them, "Don't stop
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.780]   to do this more and more."
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.780]   Because that's the final goal.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.780]   Everything that we do.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   Why do you do discipleship?
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.780]   Why do you do inductive Bible study?
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.780]   Why do we learn?
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   Why do we get trained?
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.780]   Ultimately, it's to love.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.780]   If somehow your knowledge
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780]   of the Word of God
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   is causing you to have
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   a more critical spirit
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   and lack of love,
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780]   then you missed the whole point
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.780]   of discipleship.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.780]   The goal of his commandment,
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.780]   he says, is love.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.780]   Number five.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   Love is what causes us
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   to persevere in fellowship.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.780]   1 Peter 4:8.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.780]   "Above all, keep fervent in your love
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.780]   for one another,
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.780]   because love covers
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.780]   a multitude of sins."
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.780]   One of the most practical advice
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:15.780]   you can give in a church.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.780]   Observing a community
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.780]   for 20, 30 years,
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780]   you have people coming and going,
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.780]   and they get excited,
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.780]   and then the honeymoon period is over,
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.780]   and you get to rub each other,
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.780]   their sins and faults,
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.780]   and then you get disappointed,
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.780]   and then people come, people go.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.780]   I mean, watching this community
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.780]   in the last 28 years, 30 years,
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.780]   I mean, you see a cycle over,
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.780]   and there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:42.780]   We see cycles over and over
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   and over and over again.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   You come in, get excited.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   Something about the church
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   is exciting to you,
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   but as soon as you get close enough,
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780]   like any other human being,
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.780]   any other group,
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.780]   you begin to see the warts,
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.780]   shortcomings, the selfishness, pride.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.780]   You see all of it.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.780]   And once that happens,
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.780]   that's when the real test
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.780]   of a community happens
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.780]   is when you begin to see
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.780]   the warts of people, right?
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780]   Not the honeymoon.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.780]   Not when you walk into a room
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.780]   and you see a pretty girl
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.780]   and it's like, I love her.
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.780]   That's very superficial.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.780]   I love her.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.780]   I like her hair.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.780]   I like her perfume.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.780]   I like the way she walks.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.780]   And then after the honeymoon is over
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.780]   and you see their faults,
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.780]   you see some selfishness
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   and all of that.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.780]   And that's when the community
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.780]   is really tested.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.780]   That's when a family
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.780]   is really starting to come together.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.780]   But what brings us together?
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.780]   Just more disciplined people?
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.780]   If we had just smarter people?
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.780]   If we had more experienced people?
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.780]   If we had more older people?
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.780]   No.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.780]   It says love covers a multitude of sins.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:52.780]   Love.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.780]   If a community isn't growing in love,
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.780]   it will only endure through
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.780]   the honeymoon stage
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.780]   when everything smells nice,
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.780]   everything looks good.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.780]   But what causes us to persevere
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.780]   is love.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.780]   Love is what causes us to persevere.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.780]   And six,
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.780]   love is the ultimate evidence
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   of salvation.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   John 4, 7-8.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.780]   Beloved, let us love one another,
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.780]   for love is from God.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780]   Everyone who loves is born of God
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780]   and knows God.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   The one who does not love
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.780]   does not know God,
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   for God is love.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.780]   And then in John 13, 33-35,
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.780]   Jesus says,
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780]   A new commandment I give to you,
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.780]   that you love one another.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:28.780]   Even as I have loved you,
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.780]   that you love one another.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.780]   By this all men will know
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.780]   that you are my disciples,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.780]   if you have love for one another.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.780]   Remember when God created us,
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.780]   he created us to be what?
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.780]   Image bearers of God.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.780]   We are to reflect God's glory.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   But because of our sins,
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.780]   we've been separated from God
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.780]   and we're no longer able
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   to glorify God
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.780]   because we've been tainted
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   by our sin.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   So the whole purpose of salvation
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.780]   is to restore us to God
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.780]   so that we may be the image bearers of God again.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   To reflect him.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   And so what he's saying here is,
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   what he desires more than anything else
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   that we reflect of him
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.780]   is his love.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.780]   Love.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.780]   He says, if you say that you love God
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   and you don't love one another,
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   he said, you don't really know God.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.780]   He said, the primary thing
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.780]   that Jesus is going to look for
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.780]   as evidence that you are my followers,
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   he says, if you love the way I loved you.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.780]   And this is not just talking about any love
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:35.780]   because even non-Christians love.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:36.780]   Even non-Christians love their mom,
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   their dad, their children,
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   their good friends.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.780]   He's not talking about any love.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.780]   He's talking about a covenant love.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.780]   Despite God demonstrates his love toward us
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   and that while we were yet sinners,
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.780]   Christ died for us.
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.780]   If you love each other as I have loved you,
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.780]   then they will know that you are my disciples.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   Love is the ultimate evidence of our salvation.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.780]   And then seventh and finally,
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:03.780]   love is the greatest of the virtue.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   First Corinthians 13, 13.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.780]   But now faith, hope, and love abide these strings,
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.780]   but the greatest of these is love.
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.780]   You know, if you were to put it theologically
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.780]   and put it on paper,
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.780]   if you were to choose which one is the greatest,
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.780]   I think theologically we would say faith.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.780]   Because faith is what connects us to God.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.780]   Faith is what regenerates us.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.780]   Faith is what causes us to be connected.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   Our whole destiny is changed because of faith.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.780]   So theologically we would say faith.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780]   Maybe hope.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.780]   Hope is the one that causes us to persevere.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.780]   That no matter what trials and difficulty
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.780]   and persecution comes,
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   because of the hope of the promise of eternal life,
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   that we're able to persevere.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.780]   Love is just an outcome of that.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   But he says no, it's love.
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780]   Of faith, hope, and love.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780]   Love is the greatest
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.780]   because the purpose of why we have faith
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.780]   is to bring us ultimately to love.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.780]   The reason why we persevere
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.780]   is to bring us to the final stage of love.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.780]   The goal of this commandment is love.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.780]   So imagine the weight of what he is saying.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:16.780]   Of faith, love, faith, hope, and love, the greatest.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.780]   Now I would say, you know, at the minimum,
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.780]   he's saying, well, they're equal.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.780]   He doesn't say that.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780]   No, love is the greatest.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   You know why he's saying that?
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.780]   You know why he's telling the Corinthians
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   that of faith, hope, and love, love is the greatest?
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:33.780]   Because this was a church that was divided by their faith.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.780]   They were one-upping each other.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.780]   You know, I follow Paul.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:41.780]   I follow, you know, I follow Apollos, and I follow Jesus,
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.780]   and they are one-upping each other
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.780]   because their faith is greater than the others.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   That we're somehow more righteous because of you,
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   because of who we follow and what we know.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:57.780]   Do you not know that God chose you because you were dumb?
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   Because you were base, you were nothing,
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   and now you come into the church,
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   and you're trying to be somebody in the church?
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   Do you not realize that of all the things
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.780]   that you are pursuing, the greatest is love?
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780]   The reason why you're being divided
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:16.780]   is because you've forgotten that, he says.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.780]   Of faith, hope, and love, the greatest is love.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.780]   So the natural question that we have is,
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.780]   how do we get this then, right?
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.780]   The greatest, all the commandments,
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780]   all of it fulfilled in love.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.780]   Now go do it.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.780]   Let's go, right?
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.780]   You just go home and it's like--
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:43.780]   No, no, no, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   Is that how you get love?
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.780]   Just watch.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.780]   How do you love the Lord your God
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.780]   with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength?
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.780]   Are you just determined to do it?
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   Man, it is the greatest, but it is impossible.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:13.780]   It is impossible if you are willing yourself to do it.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780]   Remember Martha?
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   She was so busy.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   I'm doing all this stuff, and remember Jesus says,
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.780]   "But Mary has chosen what is best."
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:23.780]   You're worried about so many things,
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.780]   but what was Mary doing?
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.780]   Mary's just standing, just learning,
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.780]   just soaking it up, just receiving the love of Christ.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.780]   She's just soaking it up.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.780]   Mary has chosen what is best.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.780]   Martha--churches love Marthas.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.780]   Marthas are the ones who are cleaning the bathrooms.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.780]   Marthas are the ones who are cooking.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.780]   Marthas are the one who's doing the shadow.
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.780]   Marthas--the church loves Marthas
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:50.780]   because the church is dirty without Marthas.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780]   We don't get things done without Marthas.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.780]   Evangelism doesn't happen without Marthas.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   I mean, when the Marthas are gone,
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.780]   I mean, you see it.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.780]   We love Marthas.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.780]   He's not condemning Marthas,
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.780]   but he says Mary has chosen what is best.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   And I think about first love.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.780]   He said, "You have forsaken your first love."
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.780]   Now, you know what he tells the church to do?
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.780]   Repent and redo the things at first.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.780]   Whenever I think about that,
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.780]   I remember early on as a Christian back in college,
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.780]   I wrestled with this so much
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.780]   because if this is the greatest commandment,
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.780]   this has to be my greatest pursuit.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.780]   Above evangelism and preaching and right doctrine
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.780]   and all this stuff is important,
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.780]   but he says this is the greatest commandment.
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:49.780]   And I remember, I'm not sure if I love God like that.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.780]   I love my mom.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.780]   I love my brothers at that point.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.780]   I didn't meet my wife yet.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.780]   I'm not sure if I can say I love God like that.
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.780]   So I kept on praying, "God, what does that mean?
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.780]   "How do I get that? How do I do that?
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.780]   "Do I just will myself?"
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   And I remember I would ask my Bible study leaders,
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.780]   and one of the leaders told me,
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.780]   "Just say I love you 100 times.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780]   "I love you, God. I love you, God.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   "I love you, God. I love you, God."
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.780]   So I don't know how many times that in prayer I would say,
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.780]   "I love you, God. I love you, God.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.780]   "I love you, God. I love you, God. I love you, God."
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   And I'd open my eyes and nothing.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.780]   We've actually say it in Korean, "Saranghaeyo, saranghaeyo, saranghaeyo."
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.780]   Obviously, it didn't happen that way.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   But God did answer my prayers.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   You know how he answered my prayers?
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   There was a very difficult, lonely period in my life.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.780]   It was all during that period.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.780]   And I had a prayer closet that me and my roommates would use,
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.780]   and I would go in there early in the morning to do my quiet time
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.780]   and take some time to pray.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.780]   All of a sudden, it hit me.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.780]   I wonder if I disappeared, how long it would take for my family to look for me.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:01.780]   It was a very depressing thought because I was away and I wasn't living at home.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.780]   I kind of cut myself off from my school friends because I wanted to get trained,
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.780]   and I was in apartment training and all that.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   And that thought of, "Oh, I'm by myself,
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.780]   "and all my roommates are 10, 11, 12 years older than me,
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.780]   "so I'm not their peers."
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:21.780]   And that thought is of like, "Oh, I wonder who would look for me if I was gone."
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.780]   And it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.780]   God knows you're in here.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.780]   God knows you're in here.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   And all of a sudden, everything that I already knew,
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:38.780]   everything that I already believed became so real.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.780]   I know he loved me. I confess.
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:45.780]   I know I'm here because he loves me, but it wasn't real to me.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.780]   And when his love became real to me,
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:53.780]   my love for him was simply a response.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:57.780]   "How can I not love this guy?"
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   Sometimes we get so caught up in like, "What should I do?
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.780]   "How do I bear fruit? How do I raise money?
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.780]   "What's the next stage of my life, and how do I do this?
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.780]   "How do I manage my money?"
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.780]   We get so caught up in doing something for God,
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:16.780]   but the primary thing that he's waiting for is for us to come to him.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.780]   Even prayer.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.780]   We want to be devoted to pray.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.780]   So I've been going to morning prayer,
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.780]   and I go there, and I'm trying to like, "Okay, I've got to pray,
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.780]   "and I've got all these things I've got to pray for,
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   "and I've got to pray for this. I've got to pray for that."
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:36.780]   And I sit there trying to think of all the things I've got to pray for,
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.780]   and in the middle of prayer, I'm like,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.780]   "You know, all he desires is me.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.780]   "I don't have to go to prayer and go through all this list.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.780]   "Oh, yeah, I pray."
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.780]   So I started sitting and saying, "Lord, I'm here.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:54.780]   "I just want to be near to you.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:59.780]   "You have anything to say to me? Here I am."
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   "Lord, I don't know what you want me to pray for,
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.780]   "and I have so many things, and I will pray for those things,
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:10.780]   "but Lord, first and foremost, I just want to be near you."
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.780]   And just burden just lifts, right?
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:18.780]   Like even the way I pray sometimes is like, "I've got to get this done,"
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.780]   instead of just coming to him.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.780]   And I look at the Scriptures, and Jesus would constantly break away
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.780]   from his disciples to be with the Lord.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.780]   And then we look at that and say, "Oh, Jesus needed refueling with his Father,
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:37.780]   "and that's why he needed to be refueled so that he can go back and work."
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.780]   Do you think maybe Jesus went there to rest?
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   Everybody is clamoring for him.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.780]   Everybody has a question.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   Everybody wants to test him that he broke away with his Father
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   because that's where he felt home more than any place else.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.780]   That's where he had refuge.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:59.780]   That's where he felt the love more than any place else.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.780]   So, yes, he was refueled, but he was simply refueled
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.780]   not because he put in the time of prayer.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   It's because he was with the Lord.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.780]   He was with the Lord.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.780]   God wants this more than anything else.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:18.780]   Above everything that we're doing, love him with all your heart, soul, mind,
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.780]   and strength.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.780]   And then and only then will God give you the strength to love your neighbor
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.780]   as yourself.
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:34.780]   Let's pray.
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:42.780]   Gracious Father, help us to genuinely love you.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.780]   Have confidence, Lord God, that all that we do
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:51.780]   would be an overflow of your tremendous love toward us.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.780]   Open our eyes, Father, to see what it is that we already have in you,
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:21:01.780]   that we would become worshipers who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.780]   We love you.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   Help us, Lord God, to love you more.
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:08.780]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.780]   Say, Lord, I come.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.780]   Lord, I come.
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   I confess.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.780]   Thou in me.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.780]   I find my rest.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:44.780]   Without you, I fall apart.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:52.780]   You're the one that guides my heart.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   Oh, I need you.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:09.780]   Every hour I need you.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:15.780]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:25.780]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   Where sin runs deep, your grace is more.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   Grace is found is where you are.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:47.780]   Where you are, Lord, I am free.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   Holiness is Christ in me.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   Oh, I need you.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:12.780]   Every hour I need you.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:18.780]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:24.780]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.780]   So teach my song.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   So teach my song to rest to you.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   When temptation comes my way.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:44.780]   When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:48.780]   Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:55.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   Oh, I need you.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:07.780]   Every hour I need you.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:14.780]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.780]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   Lord, I need you.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.780]   Oh, I need you.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:35.780]   Every hour I need you.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:47.780]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:56.780]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:03.780]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.780]   Let's pray.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:06.780]   First Peter 1.8.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.780]   And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.780]   Though you do not see him now, but believe in him.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.780]   You greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:26.780]   Help us, Lord God, to love you, to spread this love to all those around.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:32.780]   That more and more people may come to know what it is that you have done for us.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:37.780]   That more and more people would come to worship you, to love you.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   And send us that we may be your ambassadors wherever you send us this week.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
