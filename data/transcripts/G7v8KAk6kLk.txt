[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.900]   and obviously fun and games.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   But they are asking you to sign up.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.900]   So if you are planning to bring your children,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   you do not need to be a member of the church,
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   but you can come to that.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.820]   Because of space, what we're asking is
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   if you are planning to bring somebody who is not at church
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   for the purpose of witnessing or introduce the church,
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.820]   please sign them up as well
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.820]   so that they'll know exactly how many people to prepare for.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   And so they're going to be preparing food and snacks
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820]   and candies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   So they're asking whoever is coming to sign up
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820]   and if you're going to be bringing friends,
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   please sign them up as well.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   Thanksgiving Regional Dinner.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   I know it's in November 19th,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   but they're asking you to sign up as soon as you can
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.820]   so that they can place you in the proper groups,
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.820]   hopefully near your home.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   So there's going to be a group of maybe about 20, 25 people
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.820]   divided into homes.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   So if you sign up early, we'll be able to put you in that area.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   Otherwise, we're going to end up having to put you in places
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.820]   where maybe a little bit further away from home.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.820]   So if you're planning to and you are able to,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   And then this coming Wednesday, there is a BAM fellowship.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   If you're in the singles ministry,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   there's a bowling night that's happening
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.820]   in the middle of the summer.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.820]   That's a great place to study.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   And then FAM 245.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.820]   If you are a regular member of the FAM 245,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.820]   there's also a fellowship,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.820]   bowling fellowship happening on December 2nd as well.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   Okay, I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   I'm going to pray for us.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   Again, if you have a physical offering to drop off,
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   we have a box in the back.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   And then afterwards, we'll have Nicholas Chen.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   He's going to come up and give his testimony
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   Let's pray.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.820]   Thank you so much for the privilege that we have
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   to be able to come worship you.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.820]   to truly be able to know and to believe
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   where our hope and our help truly comes from.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   Help us to understand who you are,
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   that our worship, our giving,
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820]   may be an overflow of thanksgiving,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820]   Father God, of the grace that you've given us.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   May your offering be given joyfully,
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   cheerfully, Lord God, as an act of worship,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.820]   and be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   Let us all rise.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   And continuing on from last week,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   let's spend a few moments just to greet
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   our neighbors around us.

[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   My name is Nicholas Chen, and I am a senior at UCI.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   I was born and lived my whole life in Taiwan,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500]   coming to the States for college.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   Growing up in Taiwan, my father was agnostic,
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   and my mother was a devout Buddhist.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   Since she mostly took care of my siblings and I,
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   we all had a Buddhist upbringing,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   and she would bring me to the temples along with her
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   to pray and burn incense.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   I first learned of Christ from my mother,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   whose Christian friends had offered to pray for her
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   when my younger brother was suffering from a medical condition
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   that neither conventional medicine nor Buddhist practices
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   could explain or cure.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   After this, my mother converted to Christianity
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   and received Christ, and started bringing my siblings and I to church.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.500]   Seeing both the physical changes God made to cure my brother,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   but also the spiritual change in my mother,
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   it was really easy for me to accept Christ
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   and think that I needed Christ, that I wanted Christ,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.500]   but not need him,
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   and that I needed a lot of worldly, personal evidence.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   Unprompted, I approached my mother when I was eight
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   and asked to be baptized.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   However, I did not truly understand the gospel,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   nor would it have meant to be saved by Jesus.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   As a result, even though I had had knowledge of Scripture
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   and understanding of the existence of sin
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   and how Jesus saved me from it,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.500]   I lived my life no differently than from when I was a Buddhist,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   the only difference being that instead of praying to the gods at a temple,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   I would pray to God at home.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   This was my incomplete understanding.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   Despite knowing that I was a sinner,
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   I never felt the weight of my sin,
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   because my standard for sin was just "doing bad."
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   I went through middle school and most of high school
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   living no differently than those around me.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   Like most of the boys my age,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   we satisfied our worldly desires with Internet media,
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   all the while I was maintaining the image of a good Christian boy.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   At the same time, I placed all my self-worth in the things of the world,
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.500]   like my aides, friends, and my parents' approval.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   As a result, when I failed one test in a subject I liked,
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   my entire worldview crumbled.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   Around this time, my parents had also asked me
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   to evangelize to one of my classmates who was seeking.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   And there, God let me feel the weight of my sin
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   when I realized that I had not been following
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   the very obedience that I was describing to my classmate.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   Afterwards, I recognized that I needed to truly surrender my life to Christ
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   and depend on Him,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   and I prayed to God confessing my sins while seeking repentance.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   Unfortunately, due to my own rebelliousness and fear of man,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   I was afraid to confess this reality to anyone in my life.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   So after my prayer of repentance, I had no idea what to do from there.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   I can't say for certain when the Lord saved me from this situation.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   I think that in the years since that time,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.500]   the Spirit has been working in me to sanctify me,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   as it is written in 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 13.
