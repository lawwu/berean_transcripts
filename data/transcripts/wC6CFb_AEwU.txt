[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.860]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.860]   First of all, our family ministry prayer meeting

[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.860]   of sharing the gospel and answering some questions.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.860]   So if you have family and friends or people
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.860]   that you wanna bring to hear a formal presentation
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.860]   of the gospel, this is a time.

[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.860]   of membership class is happening.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.860]   So this is an eight-week course where we go over
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.860]   the various doctrines of our church and ministry philosophy.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.860]   So if you are interested in becoming a doctor,
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.860]   this is a, doctor, member.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   I need some more coffee, okay.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.860]   That's easy to become a doctor here.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.860]   All right, so sign up for that.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.860]   That's happening at 9.30.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.860]   It takes place during this time,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.860]   so you would have to attend service
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   in the first service or third service.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.860]   So please sign up for that, and that's starting
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   on April 27th, and it'll go all the way to June 15th.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.860]   If you're part of the Jubilee ministry,
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.860]   you're 50 and over.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.860]   Our next lunch fellowship is happening
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.860]   on April 27th at 1 p.m. at the Youth Chapel.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.860]   So the cost of the lunch is $10,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   and for children under 10 years old, it's $5.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.860]   So that's happening on, at the end of April,
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.860]   27th at 1 p.m.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.860]   And then finally, as you were coming in,
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.860]   you probably got this flyer or card
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.860]   basically with all the schedules
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   that's happening on the Passion Week.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.860]   And so in a couple weeks, we're going to be having
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   the Passion Week devotionals that's starting
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.860]   from Monday through Thursday.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.860]   And then Friday, we have the Passover, the Good Friday.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.860]   So if you haven't signed up for the Passover meal,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.860]   we encourage you to do that.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   Again, the space is limited.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.860]   So once we reach that space,
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.860]   we're going to have to close it.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.860]   So even if you haven't taken it,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.860]   we highly encourage you to come and participate
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.860]   and to hear what God has done
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   in embedding the Passover in Jewish history.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.860]   And when Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me,"
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   there's so much of preparation that went through
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.860]   to get God's people ready
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.860]   for what he was going to do on the cross,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.860]   and it is taught in the Passover meal.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.860]   And so whether you've been in it before
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.860]   or you want to come and participate in it,
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.860]   we highly encourage you to sign up for that.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.860]   And then early rise service happening at 6 a.m. that Sunday,
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.860]   and also the Sunday fellowship
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.860]   where there will be lunch provided
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.860]   for each of the services that's going on.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.860]   So they do need help.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.860]   They said that they are in need of a lot more people to sign up.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.860]   So even if you can't come and help with all of it,
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   because we will need parking assistance
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.860]   and guide and food prep,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.860]   and so all this stuff is needed.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.860]   So even if you can't do every day,
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860]   if you sign up and tell them that you can only do Sunday,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.860]   you can only do Friday,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.860]   and they'll guide you to wherever you can serve.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.860]   So if you're able to serve that week,
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.860]   any time during that week,
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.860]   and especially on Sunday and Saturday for food prep,
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   please let them know,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   and then they'll, again, get that started.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   I think that's it for all the announcements.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.860]   So let me pray for us for the offering,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.860]   and then if you have a physical offering,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.860]   there is a physical box in the back
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860]   on the way out to the right.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.860]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.860]   Father, we praise you for your goodness in our lives.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   We thank you, Father God,
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860]   for all the blessings that you give us,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.860]   things that we are aware of,
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.860]   and many things that we're not aware of.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.860]   Help us to have a heart and eyes that are lifted up to Christ,
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.860]   to know what it is that we have,
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.860]   that we may come to celebrate and to give you thanks.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.860]   We pray, Father God, that you would search us and know us
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.860]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.860]   that we may come before your throne with clean hands,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.860]   that we may receive forgiveness of sins, restoration,
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.860]   and intimate fellowship with you, Father God, through this time.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   And so we pray, Father God,
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.860]   that you would help us to give you worship in spirit and in truth,
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.860]   both in singing, both in learning,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.860]   and also, Father God, in our giving,
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   that we may give with joyful hearts as an act of worship
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.860]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.860]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:04.860]   - Let us all rise and spend a few moments
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   to greet the neighbors around us.

[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.860]   Luke chapter 5, 11, verses 5 through 13.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.860]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.860]   "Then he said to them, 'Suppose one of you has a friend
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   "'and goes to him at midnight and says to him,
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.860]   "'Friend, lend me three loaves.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.860]   "'For a friend of mine has come to me from a journey
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.860]   "'and I have nothing to set before him.'
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.860]   "'And from inside he answers and says,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.860]   "'Do not bother me, the door has already been shut
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   "'and my children and I are in bed.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   "'I cannot get up and give you anything.'
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   "'I tell you, even though he will not get up
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   "'and give him anything because he is his friend,
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.860]   "'yet because of his persistence,
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.860]   "'he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.860]   "'So I say to you, ask and it will be given to you,

[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   Let's pray.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:05.860]   Gracious Father, we pray that the voice of Christ
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.860]   would be made clear to us,
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.860]   that we would not simply hear the words
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.860]   that has been written in history,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   but that we would hear your very living word, Lord God,
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.860]   that it may judge the thoughts and intentions of our own heart.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.860]   Help us, Lord God, to hear from him,
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.860]   that we may follow him and him alone.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.860]   Continuing our series here
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.860]   in the devotion to prayer,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   where the disciples see Jesus praying
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.860]   and they see something about Jesus' ministry,
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.860]   his life, his intimacy with Christ,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.860]   and ask Jesus, "Teach us how to pray."
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.860]   They were given the power of the Spirit
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.860]   to cast out demons, to heal the sick,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.860]   so they've seen many miracles.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.860]   They've seen Jesus do many, many miracles,
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.860]   but above everything that he has done
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.860]   was recorded for us here in Matthew,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.860]   where the disciples saw clearly
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.860]   there's something about his prayer life,
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   there's something about his relationship with God
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   that they wanted access to,
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   and they asked Jesus, "Teach us how to pray."
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.860]   And in response to that, we know the Lord's Prayer,
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.860]   where he tells them to pray,
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.860]   "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.860]   Your kingdom come, your will be done,
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.860]   on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   So he teaches them a pattern of prayer,
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.860]   not a prayer, but a pattern of prayer,
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   and above and beyond that,
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.860]   the Scripture is filled with instructions
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   and commandments and encouragement
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.860]   that we ought to pray.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   We ought to be devoted to prayer.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.860]   This is our theme this year.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.860]   Devotion to prayer isn't just something that happens,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.860]   just like anything else.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.860]   If you're devoted to something,
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   it means you make time.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.860]   You make that your priority.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.860]   You don't just naturally drift or pray.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   You don't just wait until you're inspired to pray.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   You are devoted to prayer
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.860]   because you know it's important,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.860]   whether it is hard in the morning or at night,
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.860]   you commit to do that.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.860]   Just like if you commit to go run,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.860]   if you commit to go to the gym,
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   if you commit to losing weight,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.860]   whatever it is that you're committed to,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.860]   you're making that your priority.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.860]   And so that's why he says that we need
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.860]   to devote ourselves to prayer.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.860]   So if you're waiting for your natural inclination
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.860]   to kind of inspire you to pray,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.860]   you'll find out that that doesn't come.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.860]   We're told to pray privately,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.860]   not just so that other people can see.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.860]   So if your prayer life only exists
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.860]   when we are gathered together corporately,
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.860]   you're missing the whole point,
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.860]   the whole point of prayer.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.860]   He says to come before the Lord.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.860]   Come before the Lord,
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.860]   and there's a personal connection with God.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.860]   It is not for other people to see.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.860]   Not that we are not commanded to pray together,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.860]   but we are instructed to make sure
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.860]   that we pray privately.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   Pray consistently, he tells us.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   That you don't only pray for certain circumstances,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.860]   but that prayer has to be the very breath of our life.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.860]   To continue to pray,
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.860]   no matter what circumstance that you're in.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.860]   So whether you are having turmoil,
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.860]   whether you're living in peace,
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   he says pray for all situations.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.860]   He says to pray in faith.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.860]   Pray believing that you will receive,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   that it is not just some chart
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.860]   that you say the right things,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.860]   and some miraculous things are going to happen.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.860]   We come to him in faith because we know
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.860]   that only he can answer us.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.860]   We are to pray persistently,
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.860]   even if you don't get the answer right away.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.860]   He said continue to pray.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.860]   Persist in your prayer.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.860]   He said to be bold in your prayer.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.860]   Know that the throne of grace has been opened to us,
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.860]   that we are to pray boldly
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   when we come before the Lord.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.860]   And we are to pray passionately.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.860]   That things that matter to us,
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   to seek him with all of our hearts.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.860]   And so these are just some of the things
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.860]   that we can summarize the Bible tells us to pray.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.860]   Just how important it is for an individual
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.860]   and for the church to pray.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.860]   If I told you this morning,
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   if I came up here and said,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.860]   "You know, I didn't have much time to look at my Bible,
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.860]   I'm just going to wing it this morning."
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   How many of you would sit here and pay attention?
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   You would probably say,
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.860]   "Well, this guy didn't even study his Bible,
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.860]   how am I going to pay attention to him?"
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.860]   I told you, "You know, I didn't have much time,
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.860]   I was busy this week,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.860]   so I'm just going to see what the Lord has for us today."
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.860]   And I just started speaking whatever I wanted to speak.
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.860]   How many of you would take me seriously?
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.860]   We should have equal concern
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.860]   when there's lack of prayer,
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   whether it is up in the pulpit or in the pews.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.860]   This is how important it is
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.860]   that we need to be a church that prays.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.860]   Pray passionately, devotedly,
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   persistently, consistently, privately,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.860]   devotedly.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   So the natural question that we have is,
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   when do you pray that way?
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.860]   When do you pray that way?
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   Can you remember a time
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.860]   when you could say, maybe not all of it,
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   but you prayed consistently, you prayed passionately,
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.860]   you prayed urgently?
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.860]   Most likely it was when you were desperate for something.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.860]   Maybe something happened in your life
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.860]   and you found that you have no other resource
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.860]   but to come to God,
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.860]   and you start crying out desperately.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.860]   Usually, when we get prayer requests from the church,
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.860]   it's usually because you are desperate.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.860]   Something has happened. Somebody in your family is sick.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.860]   Somebody just received...
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   they have cancer,
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.860]   and they're trying their best,
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.860]   but it doesn't look good.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   And so, by the time we get your prayer request,
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.860]   it's probably because
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.860]   there's something urgent happening in your life.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.860]   And you don't have to be a mature Christian
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.860]   to pray that way when your circumstances
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.860]   lead you to that.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.860]   When there's fire in your feet
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.860]   that causes you to pray.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   Or, maybe there's something
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.860]   that is very, very important to you.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.860]   It's urgent, but it's very important.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.860]   And so, you pray persistently.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   And maybe you've been praying for
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.860]   the salvation of somebody that you love
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.860]   for 10, 15, 20, 30 years.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.860]   And you've been persisting in that prayer
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   because this is a prayer that must happen.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   And it is important to us.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.860]   But the natural question is,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.860]   what if there isn't a fire?
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.860]   What if there isn't something
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.860]   that you're not that concerned about?
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.860]   How do you pray passionately?
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.860]   How do you pray with urgency?
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.860]   When that may not be the case.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.860]   If the content of our prayer
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.860]   is mostly about safety, protection,
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   and freedom from turmoil in our life,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.860]   it's very difficult to pray with urgency and passion.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.860]   Because what we're bringing to Him
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.860]   isn't urgent.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.860]   We just cover, you know.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.860]   We're going out to missions and give us safety.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.860]   We're endeavoring on new business,
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.860]   and so cover us.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.860]   Protect us.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.860]   So the comfort and the safety that we're already enjoying,
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   that nothing that's going to happen
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   is going to disturb any of that.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.860]   If that's the content of our prayer,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   it's very difficult to pray with urgency
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.860]   because we don't feel urgent about that,
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.860]   especially in a rich country.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   Our needs are taken care of.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.860]   How many of us are struggling
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.860]   that after this service,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.860]   you don't know what you're going to eat?
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.860]   So what do we pray urgently for?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.860]   Again, some of you are in a situation
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:27.860]   where there is urgency.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   There is something desperate
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   that God is causing you to pray
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   and get on your knees and cry out to Him.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.860]   But urgency and passion typically comes
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.860]   when we are aligned with His will.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.860]   When we are aligned with His will.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.860]   John 15, 7, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   Ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.860]   Urgency tends to come, not from us,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.860]   but from Him.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.860]   Because He said, "The Son of Man did not come
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   to be served, but to serve,
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.860]   and to give His life as a ransom for many."
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.860]   He came to seek and save the lost.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.860]   So when our will is aligned with His will,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.860]   the urgency and passion is given to us by Him.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   When we are praying for things
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   that we're not confident if this is
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.860]   ultimately His will or not.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.860]   It's just our desire.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.860]   We want this.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.860]   This is how I want my life to be.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.860]   This is how I want my children to be.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.860]   And so we may pray, but we're not exactly sure.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   Is this Your will?
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   But when your life is in line with His will,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   and the content of your prayer
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.860]   is consistent with a sense of urgency
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   in the Scripture,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.860]   God gives you the urgency
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.860]   to be able to pray.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.860]   He says in Luke 11, 9-10,
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   "I ask you, ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.860]   Seek, and you will find.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.860]   Knock, and it will be opened to you.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.860]   For everyone who asks, receives.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   He who seeks, finds.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.860]   And to him who knocks, it will be opened."
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.860]   The imperatives in this text
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   is in present imperative.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   Meaning, the way we have to understand it
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   is keep on asking, keep on seeking,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.860]   and keep on knocking.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.860]   That's the way we have to understand it
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   in the English.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.860]   This is not a one-time seek, ask, and knock.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.860]   It's that this is a pattern of a life
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.860]   that He is telling us,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.860]   that if you're going to pray,
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.860]   that you need to keep on asking,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   keep on seeking, keep on knocking,
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   so that He may keep on answering,
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.860]   keep on revealing Himself,
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   and keep on opening the door.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   Jeremiah 33, 3, it says,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   "Call to Me, and I will answer you,
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   and I will tell you great and mighty things
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.860]   which you do not know."
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   It said, "Ask of Me."
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   Every single one of us,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.860]   we're constantly seeking counsel.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   If you are trying to buy a house,
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.860]   you may talk to a realtor and ask them,
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   "Is this a good time to buy?"
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.860]   If you're planning to buy a car,
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.860]   you may ask somebody else
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.860]   who may be good, you know,
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   know all the information,
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   you may ask them.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   Or if you're raising your children,
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   you may ask people who've gone before you
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   and ask them, like,
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   "What's the best way to raise children?"
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   We're constantly seeking for counsel.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.860]   But He says, "Ask of Me.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.860]   Call Me, and I will give you things.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   I will reveal to you things
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.860]   that no one else can tell you."
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.860]   1 John 5, 14-15,
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.860]   this is the confidence which we have before Him
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.860]   that if we ask according to His will,
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.860]   He hears us.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.860]   And if we know that He hears us,
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.860]   whatever we ask,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   we know that we have the request
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   which we have asked from Him.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   Do we recognize who it is
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   that we have access to?
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.860]   If somebody told you
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.860]   that the President of the United States
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   is asking you,
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.860]   he's coming into town,
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   and he requested you,
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   and he said,
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   "Whatever it is that you desire,
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   whatever request you have,
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.860]   bring it to me,
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   and I will answer you."
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   I have a feeling that you're going to sit there
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.860]   and you're not going to be asking
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.860]   for free tickets to Disneyland.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   You're not going to be asking
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   for the latest clothes.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   You're going to be asking Him
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.860]   based on who it is that you're asking.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   Something that only He can do.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.860]   No other person has that power.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   Maybe you have somebody that you know,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   that you love,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   that's sitting in prison,
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.860]   and He has the authority
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.860]   to pardon that person.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   He has the power to do things
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   that other people cannot do.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   So, knowing who He is,
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   the request that we will make
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   will be different.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   He says, "Ask of Me."
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   If you ask according to My will,
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   He has the power,
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.860]   the One who created us from dust.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.860]   All the universe was created in six days.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.860]   He said, "We have access to Him."
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   He says, "Ask of Me."
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.860]   You're constantly asking for counsel
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   and help and direction
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   from everybody else,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.860]   but are you asking Me?
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   Keep on asking.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   Keep on seeking.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   Isaiah 55, "Seek the Lord
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.860]   while He may be found.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   Call upon Him while He is near."
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.860]   When is it that He can't be found?
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.860]   At what point is He not near?
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.860]   Does He just kind of come,
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   draw near sometimes,
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   and then when He's tired
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.860]   He just kind of disappears?
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   Is He playing hide-and-seek with us?
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.860]   What does He mean when He says,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   "While He may be found"?
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.860]   While you are convicted,
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   while the Word of God
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.860]   is bearing fruit in you,
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.860]   while you hear Him calling you,
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.860]   and you say, "Maybe not today.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   I need to get married.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.860]   I have children to raise.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   I have bills to pay.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.860]   Maybe not today.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   Of course I love the Lord,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.860]   but maybe not today."
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   Typically, Christians don't disobey God.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.860]   They just delay obedience.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   Then you find out as years go by,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   as you continue to ignore
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   His calling, your heart
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.860]   begins to get hardened.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.860]   And you no longer even have
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   a desire to call upon Him
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   and to seek Him.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   Because you've hardened your heart.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   You've kept on closing the door
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   and no longer do you see any need.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   You can function without Him.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   You can pay your bills without Him.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   When a professing Christian
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.860]   feels perfectly safe,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.860]   without coming to Him in prayer,
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   you know that your heart
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   has been hardened.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.860]   You know you have been deceived.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   If you're a professing Christian
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   and you can't remember the last time
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   you came to the Lord,
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   seeking Him and praying to Him,
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   and you feel perfectly fine today,
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   tomorrow, and the next day,
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   your heart has become hardened.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.860]   You have been deceived
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.860]   and you don't even know it.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.860]   He says, "Seek me
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   while I may be found."
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.860]   Hebrews 11:6,
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   "Without faith it is impossible
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860]   to please Him,
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.860]   for he who comes to God
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.860]   must believe that he is
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   and that he is a rewarder
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   of those who seek him."
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.860]   In the NIV it says,
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.860]   "He who earnestly,
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   diligently seek Him."
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   It is impossible to please God
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.860]   unless you really have faith.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.860]   And how is that faith seen?
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   He says.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   That faith is seen
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.860]   when you diligently seek Him.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.860]   You can profess to have faith
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.860]   if you believe that He's the answer.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.860]   If you believe He's the answer,
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.860]   but you never ask Him.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.860]   If you believe all that you need
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   is with Him, and you believe that,
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.860]   then you will naturally seek Him.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.860]   That's what He says.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.860]   It is impossible to please Him.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   He who comes to God
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   must first believe that He is.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.860]   He is.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   Not through Him, but He is.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   And because you believe that He is,
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   you diligently seek Him.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   It says, "Keep on knocking."
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   Revelations 3, 19-20,
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   "Those whom I love,
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.860]   I reprove and discipline.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   Therefore, be zealous and repent.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   Behold, I stand at the door
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.860]   and knock.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.860]   If anyone hears my voice
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.860]   and opens the door,
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   I will come in to him
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.860]   and will dine with him
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   and he with me."
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   This is not a text for evangelism.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   Some of you guys
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.860]   who may have memorized this
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   in the context of evangelism,
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.860]   he's talking to the church.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   He's talking to the Laodicean church
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   who has become lukewarm,
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   saying, "You're neither hot nor cold."
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.860]   And then he says,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   "I will spit you out of my mouth."
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   It's detestable to him
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   to come to him week after week
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   and sing empty songs
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   with cold hearts.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   You're just coming
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   and putting your time in,
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   but you're not really seeking Him.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   And he says,
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.860]   "I will spit you out of my mouth."
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   I mean, it's the harshest judgment
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860]   that he has toward any church
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   is this lukewarm church.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   "You're neither hot nor cold."
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   And then he follows up
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   at the end of that
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.860]   calling them, warning them to repent.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   And then he says,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.860]   "I'm standing at the door knocking."
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.860]   Knocking.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.860]   He's knocking at the lukewarm church
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.860]   to open your door,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.860]   not to simply put in your time,
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.860]   not to simply come in and say,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.860]   "You know, on Sunday, I checked off.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.860]   I went to church."
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   He's knocking at the door
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   to cause a lukewarm church to wake up
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.860]   and decide for himself
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.860]   that, "I will ask, and I will seek,
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.860]   and I will knock."
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.860]   If Christ is at the door of a lukewarm church
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.860]   hoping that we will open the door to Him,
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.860]   and then He says,
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   "If you open it up,
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   you will sit with me
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.860]   and you will dine with me.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   We will have a banquet together," He says.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   Imagine if that God,
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.860]   who is patiently waiting
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   and knocking on the door,
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.860]   waiting for us to open the door,
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.860]   imagine if we started knocking.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   Imagine if we knocked on the door,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.860]   how eagerly He would be waiting
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.860]   for us to open that door.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   So He says, "Keep seeking.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   Keep asking.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   Keep knocking."
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.860]   And He who asks, He will answer.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   He who seeks, He will be found.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   He who knocks,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   the door will be opened to Him.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   That's us.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   We need to make up our mind.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.860]   We need to make up our mind.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.860]   In order for us to pray,
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.860]   you cannot live a life
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   independent of Christ
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   Monday through Saturday
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860]   and have a passionate prayer life.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.860]   You're just not going to have that.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   You can say the words.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   You can check off the list.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   You can make a list of things
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.860]   that you desire before God,
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.860]   like you're taking it to Santa Claus.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   But a passionate, persistent,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.860]   urgent prayer, you will not have
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.860]   until our lives are aligned
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.860]   and the urgency comes from Him.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   But the natural question that we have is,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   why does He even ask us to pray this way?
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.860]   Look at what He says,
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.860]   Luke 11, 5 through 8.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.860]   The example that He gives,
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.860]   "Suppose one of you has a friend
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   and goes to him at midnight
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.860]   and says to him,
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   'Friend, lend me three loaves.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   For a friend of mine has come to me
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   from a journey
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   and have nothing to set before him.'
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   And from inside he answers and says,
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.860]   'Do not bother me.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.860]   The door has already been shut
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   and my children and I are in bed.'"
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.860]   Let me stop right there.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.860]   Think how trivial this request is.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.860]   I know this is an Asian church, right?
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.860]   And this is an Asian context.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   And so a friend comes
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.860]   and he doesn't have anything
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.860]   to present to him.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.860]   So is he going to die
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   if he waits until next morning?
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   This is not a situation
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.860]   where he got in an accident
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   and his leg is cut off
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.860]   and if he doesn't get urgent care
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   he's going to die tonight.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.860]   No, he doesn't have enough bread.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   He doesn't have enough bread.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.860]   So he's trying to save face.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   I have a friend who came over
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   and I want to be a good host.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   And I want to make sure
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.860]   that he's going to sleep
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   with food in his stomach.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.860]   So he's bothering him at midnight
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.860]   with children who are sleeping.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   So Jesus, the example that he gives
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   is very trivial.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   And he's knocking at the door
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   and then he says,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   "I cannot get up
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.860]   and give you anything."
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.860]   I tell you, even though
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.860]   he will not get up
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.860]   and give him anything
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   because he is his friend,
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   yet because of his persistence
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.860]   he will get up and give him
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.860]   as much as he needs.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.860]   So again, I want you to think, right?
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   Why does Jesus give this trivial example
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.860]   of why we need to persistently pray?
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.860]   Imagine if you were in that situation,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   that you were the guy
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.860]   who got woken up at 12 at night
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.860]   and your friend comes over
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.860]   and he's knocking on your door
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.860]   and you say, "What is it?"
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.860]   He said, "Hey, you got some bread?"
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.860]   How would you react?
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.860]   I don't think you'd be as patient as this guy.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.860]   Are you kidding me?
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.860]   It's 12 o'clock at night.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.860]   You couldn't wait six, seven hours
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.860]   and wake up in the morning and ask me?
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.860]   He's going to die
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   because he doesn't have bread?
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.860]   And I say, "Go back to sleep."
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.860]   And he waits a little bit
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:04.860]   and he gets comfortable
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   and I say, "What is it?"
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.860]   "Man, I really need some bread.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   I have a friend who came out of town.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   He's got nothing.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   I'm trying to feed him.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   Can you give me some bread?"
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   Every single one of us in this room
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.860]   is like, "Okay, I'm going to erase this guy
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   from my phone list."
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.860]   There's no way I'm going to be friends
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   with this guy again.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   If this guy comes to my house
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.860]   and he's just so selfish
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   that he's not only waking me up,
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   he's going to wake up all my children
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   in the middle of the night.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   For what purpose?
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.860]   To save face.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   Goes back to sleep
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.860]   and he's like...
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   And he just wouldn't let him sleep.
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   And he says,
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   happens to be his friend
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   and that's why he's there.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.860]   But because of his persistence,
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   you know what another word
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   for persistence is?
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   Annoyance.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.860]   Because he was annoyed to death.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   If I don't give him some bread,
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   he's not going to leave me alone.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.860]   So he gets up and gives it to him.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   That's the example that Jesus gives.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   So what is the application of this?
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   Annoy God.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.860]   If you annoy God enough,
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   if you keep coming to him enough,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   if you keep banging on the door enough
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.860]   to save face,
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   he's going to be so annoyed with you
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   that he's just going to give in.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   Let's pray.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   Can you think of a circumstance
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.860]   where death's man's behavior
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.860]   would be welcomed?
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   That this persistence is knocking on the door.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   Can you think of a circumstance,
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.860]   even one circumstance,
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.860]   where his behavior is actually welcomed?
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.860]   Because that's what God is saying here, right?
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   God is saying, using that as an example,
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   to come to me this way.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   Can you think of a realistic example
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   of where this type of persistence
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   would be welcomed?
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.860]   Think about it.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   Can you think of one?
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.860]   No, nobody?
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.860]   You don't have to say it, okay,
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   because I know you're Asian.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.860]   Raise your hand if you can think of one.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.860]   Oh, not a single hand.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.860]   Oh, maybe one or two, okay?
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.860]   All right.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   Let me ask you, what is that circumstance?
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   [laughter]
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   [inaudible]
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.860]   At midnight?
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.860]   Okay, you're too godly.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.860]   All right.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.860]   That could be.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.860]   That could be, but you'd still be--
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:04.860]   If somebody knocked on your door twice,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.860]   like, "Hey, I'm going to share the gospel with you."
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.860]   Anybody else?
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.860]   Somebody else, raise your hand.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.860]   I promise you, I won't embarrass you
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.860]   like I did with--
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.860]   [inaudible]
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.860]   Yes, the house was on fire,
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   but that's not the situation here.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   If it was urgent, yes, for sure,
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   but this is bread.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   I can think of one.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.860]   When they're my kids.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.860]   Yeah, when they're my kids.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.860]   Because I have adult children who live outside the house,
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   and they said, "If you need anything,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.860]   if you need anything, if you need it,
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.860]   here's my key.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.860]   I want you to have the key."
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.860]   Usually, the children don't give kids to the parents,
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.860]   because that's their space,
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.860]   but the parents will give you the key,
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   because I want this to be your home at all times,
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   whether you are 20 or 40 or 60.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   If it's my home, it is your home.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.860]   And whether it's 12 o'clock or 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock,
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   if you need me, I will be there.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.860]   The only context where this would be welcome
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.860]   is if a loving father is telling his children,
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.860]   "If you need me, I will come."
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.860]   In every other context, this is unacceptable.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:36.860]   In any other context, this is just annoying.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.860]   You don't have enough sense.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.860]   But why would God give us this example and said,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.860]   "Even this guy who's annoyed will open the door."
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   How much more your Heavenly Father will open the door?
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.860]   Because He desires to give you.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.860]   The only context that this would make any sense
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.860]   is if the recipient of that,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.860]   who is telling you to do that, loves you
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.860]   and wants to open.
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   Just ask me, whether it's 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock,
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   if you need me, just keep asking,
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.860]   and I will come.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.860]   That's the example that He's giving us.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   But if even who hears evil knows how to give good gifts,
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.860]   how much more your Heavenly Father,
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   if you ask Him, if you seek Him, if you knock,
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.860]   how eagerly that even through a lukewarm church
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.860]   that He's so frustrated, you need to repent,
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   and then He's at the door knocking, hoping
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.860]   that you will recognize where you are
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.860]   and just open the door.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.860]   How much more, if we knock the door,
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   if we come to Him, if we ask Him,
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   it only makes sense,
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.860]   because this is an expression of His love.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.860]   Our Heavenly Father, our Abba Father,
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.860]   where He made us co-heirs with Christ.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.860]   As my Son, Jesus, can enter the throne of grace
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.860]   with confidence, you also, as co-heirs,
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   have the ability to come to me that way.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   It's not because He doesn't care.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.860]   Luke, in Matthew 6:26, "And look at the birds of the air
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.860]   that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns,
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.860]   Are you not worth much more than they?"
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.860]   Look at all the evidence of God's care.
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   If God cares for even the birds of the air,
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.860]   how much more would your Heavenly Father
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.860]   be eager to receive you into His home
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.860]   if you come and ask, seek, and knock?
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.860]   It says in Psalm 2.8, "Ask of me,
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.860]   and I will surely give you nations as your inheritance,
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   and the very ends of the earth as your possession."
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   Things that you can't possibly imagine.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   Things that you can't possibly do on your own.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   It says, "Ask of me, and I will give you nations
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.860]   as your inheritance."
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   Jeremiah 29.13, "You will seek me and find me
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.860]   when you search me with," what?
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.860]   "All your heart."
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   All your heart.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   He's waiting for us to make up our mind.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.860]   He's waiting for us to make up our mind.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   Like sometimes the way we live our Christian life
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   is like we have these pursuits and desires,
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   and all we did was add Jesus to the life
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.860]   that we previously had.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.860]   And so our prayers are weak because
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   we haven't surrendered yet.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.860]   We haven't really exchanged our life with His new life.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.860]   We're still holding on to our old life,
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   and we're trying to have Jesus help me
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.860]   with my old life.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.860]   He said, "You will seek me and find me
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.860]   when you seek me with all your heart."
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   When you have made up your mind that
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   I am the one that you want.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.860]   When you have made up your mind that
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   this is the most important thing in your life,
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.860]   and you pray passionately, urgently, diligently,
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.860]   and you ask me, and you seek, and knock,
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.860]   and it will be open to you.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.860]   This is why the house is called
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.860]   the house of prayer.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   You know Jacob's life, right?
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   Jacob and Esau.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.860]   And Jacob is favored by God,
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.860]   and God had this plan that He planned
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.860]   from the beginning.
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.860]   That He was going to use Jacob
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.860]   to establish His nation,
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   and He's going to use them to bless
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:23.860]   all the other nations.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.860]   He's going to give them the law.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.860]   So this was ordained
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.860]   way before Jacob was ever born.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.860]   Jacob comes, and his life basically means,
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.860]   his name Jacob means usurper.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.860]   Slippery one.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   The one who's constantly maneuvering, right?
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.860]   He would have been a good businessman,
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.860]   a salesman.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.860]   He's always making these maneuvers
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.860]   to get ahead in life.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.860]   And he gets into all kinds of trouble.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.860]   And finally he matures, he grows,
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.860]   becomes a very wealthy man,
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   and he's going to meet his brother Esau.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.860]   And last time he saw Esau,
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.860]   Esau wanted to kill him.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.860]   But he knew that he needed to reconcile
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.860]   with his brother.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   And so he encounters God.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.860]   He encounters an angel,
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.860]   which most theologians believe
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   that he was a theophany of Christ.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   And he wrestles, and he recognizes
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.860]   that this is from God.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.860]   And he says, "You need to bless me,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   "or I cannot go see my brother.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   "I might die."
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.860]   And the angel is trying to fight against him.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.860]   And guess what?
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.860]   Jacob wins.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.860]   Jacob beats God.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.860]   And so he said, "Okay, I give in."
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.860]   And the angel of God, right?
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   God himself gives in to him.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.860]   Did Jacob really win God?
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.860]   Did he win God?
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.860]   Then he pops his hip out,
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.860]   and he's like, every time he's limping.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:54.860]   The rest of his life he's limping,
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.860]   reminding him.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.860]   Like his wrestling match with God.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.860]   Can you imagine?
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.860]   He lived his life, and he said,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.860]   "Hey, why are you limping?"
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:07.860]   "Oh, this is when I beat God in wrestling."
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.860]   Can you imagine that?
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.860]   All his life, like, "Oh, why are you limping?"
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.860]   "Oh, yeah, I beat God."
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.860]   "What did you do?
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.860]   "What are you known for?"
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.860]   That's what Jacob was known for.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.860]   He wrestled with God.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.860]   And then God changes his name.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.860]   You know what his name is?
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.860]   Israel.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.860]   You know what Israel means?
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   Wrestles with God.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.860]   Wrestles with God.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.860]   That's what his name literally means.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.860]   Contends with God.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   He names the children that he had ordained
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.860]   all this time.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   And then through the wrestling of Jacob,
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.860]   he names them, "My people will be called
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   "people who wrestles with God."
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   That's the name of Israel.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   And then so, he says, the temple is what?
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.860]   A house of prayer.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.860]   Where people who wrestle with God
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.860]   come to wrestle with God at church.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.860]   To meet God.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.860]   Knowing that he's our answer.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.860]   Knowing that this is what he wants.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   We come to church.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.860]   We were looking for community.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.860]   We're looking for good Sunday school.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.860]   We're looking for good teaching.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.860]   We're looking for all kinds of stuff.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.860]   But the primary thing that the church is to be
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   is a place where people come to wrestle with God.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   That's why he calls it a house of prayer.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.860]   Not simply a house of learning,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.860]   house of community.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.860]   It's a house of prayer.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.860]   Now, was that because Jacob somehow
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:41.860]   beat God in wrestling?
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.860]   No, that's what God intended all along.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.860]   He was waiting.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.860]   He was waiting for Jacob to recognize that.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.860]   He was waiting for Jacob to make up his mind.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:58.860]   Am I the God that you want?
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.860]   He says to ask, seek, and knock.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.860]   Because he wants us to make up our mind.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.860]   Is it God that we want?
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.860]   Or is it just the bread that he gives?
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.860]   Is he the bread?
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.860]   Or are we just asking for bread?
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.860]   This is mind-blowing.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.860]   Only a God who loves us
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:27.860]   would even present this to us and say,
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   "Come. Annoy me.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   Knock at 12 o'clock at night.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.860]   Knock and persist.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.860]   Don't give up.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.860]   Keep coming to me
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.860]   if you know that I'm the answer."
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.860]   And then, look at the way he answers.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:47.860]   Luke 11, 11-13,
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.860]   "Now suppose one of you fathers
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.860]   is asked by his son for a fish.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.860]   He will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.860]   Or if he asks for an egg,
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.860]   he will not give him a scorpion, will he?
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:57:59.860]   If you then, being evil,
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.860]   know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.860]   how much more will your heavenly Father
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.860]   give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.860]   First of all, ouch, right?
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.860]   If you, being evil,
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.860]   know how to be a good father,
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.860]   how much more your heavenly Father?
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.860]   Now, obviously,
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.860]   he's not talking to anything specific that they're doing.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:26.860]   He's just talking about mankind, right?
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   Every single one of us
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   has been affected by sin,
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.860]   selfishness, anger.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.860]   I mean, we all struggle.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.860]   There's not a single person
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.860]   that doesn't struggle with some kind of sin.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   If you, who've been affected by sin
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.860]   and selfishness,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.860]   even if your children are selfish,
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.860]   it's hard when they're being selfish
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.860]   and they say hurtful things.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.860]   It's hard.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.860]   And you, who've been affected by sin,
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:54.860]   if even you know how to give good gifts,
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.860]   how much your perfect Father,
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   who's never sinned,
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   who's perfectly holy,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.860]   knows all things, all powerful,
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   how much more that loving heavenly Father
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.860]   know how to give good gifts?
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.860]   If a friend who is annoyed
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:11.860]   in the middle of the night,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.860]   if you can bother him enough to get him
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:14.860]   because he's annoyed
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.860]   that he will give you good gifts,
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   how much more your heavenly Father,
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.860]   who is inviting you to come,
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.860]   desiring for you to come,
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.860]   commanding you to come,
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.860]   how much more will He give you good gifts?
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   But look at what He says about good gifts.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.860]   How much more is your heavenly Father
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.860]   will give you what?
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.860]   What is He going to give?
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.860]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   How much will He give the Holy Spirit?
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.860]   It says clearly in Ezekiel 36, 26-27.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.860]   In the New Covenant,
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.860]   the difference between the Old Covenant
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.860]   and the New Covenant
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:53.860]   is the Holy Spirit.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   He said the whole gift of the New Covenant
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.860]   is the Holy Spirit.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.860]   You know why you and I needed to be sanctified?
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.860]   Covered by the blood of Christ?
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.860]   Not simply so that we don't go to hell.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.860]   In order for the Holy Spirit
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.860]   to make an indwelling in us,
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.860]   we need to have been cleansed
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.860]   because if the Holy Spirit indwells us
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.860]   in our sinful state,
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.860]   what will happen to us?
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.860]   What will happen to us?
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.860]   We'll die.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.860]   We cannot, a sinful man,
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.860]   cannot be in the presence of a Holy God and live.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.860]   So in order for us to have the Holy Spirit,
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   we needed to be sanctified
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.860]   and washed in the blood of Christ.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.860]   And that's why He says
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.860]   new wine cannot be poured into old wineskin.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.860]   New wine has to be poured into new wineskin.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.860]   Guess what the new wineskin is?
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.860]   It's us, washed in the blood of Christ.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.860]   Guess what the new wine is?
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.860]   The Holy Spirit.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:53.860]   So the whole difference
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860]   between the new and the old
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   is the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.860]   The whole gift of the new covenant
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.860]   is the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.860]   The purpose of the cross
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.860]   is to give us the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.860]   And it's the Holy Spirit
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.860]   that works as an advocate for us.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.860]   He's the one who stands.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.860]   He says in John 14, 6-7,
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.860]   "I will ask the Father,
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.860]   and He will give you another helper."
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.860]   And the word helper is parakletes.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.860]   Some of your translations,
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.860]   it'll say helper.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.860]   But the literal translation is advocate.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   The one who advocates for us,
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.860]   who stands up for us.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.860]   If you've ever had an older brother,
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.860]   you know, I had an older brother.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.860]   I have an older brother.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.860]   My earliest memory of my older brother,
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   because he's three years older than me,
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.860]   he's not in this service today.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.860]   He was my parakletes.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.860]   No matter what trouble
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.860]   I got into the neighborhood,
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.860]   everybody knew I had an older brother.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.860]   And he hit puberty early.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.860]   So he was bigger
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.860]   than normal human beings at that time.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.860]   I can walk into the neighborhood
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:01:59.860]   with confidence,
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.860]   and all the bullies would come out
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.860]   and do whatever they want,
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.860]   but I got an older brother.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.860]   You know?
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.860]   He said the Holy Spirit,
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   He's your advocate.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   John 14, 26,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.860]   "But the helper, the Holy Spirit,
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   whom the Father will send in my name,
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.860]   He will teach you all things
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.860]   and remind you of all,
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.860]   everything that you need."
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.860]   He said He will teach you.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.860]   The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.860]   John 15, 26,
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.860]   "When the helper comes,
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.860]   whom I will send to you from the Father,
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.860]   namely the Spirit of truth,
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   who comes from the Father,
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.860]   He will testify about me."
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.860]   How often do we get lost
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.860]   and looking for counsel
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.860]   because we don't know which way to go,
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.860]   what decisions to make.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   He said the Holy Spirit,
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.860]   He's the one who will teach you.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:39.860]   John 16, 13,
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.860]   "But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes,
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.860]   He will guide you into all truth,
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.860]   for He will not speak on His own,
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   but whatever He hears,
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.860]   He will speak and He will disclose to you
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.860]   what is to come."
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:50.860]   When you're coming,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.860]   seeking, asking, and knocking
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:53.860]   for direction, for counsel
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.860]   because you're lost,
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.860]   He said the Holy Spirit
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.860]   is the one who's going to guide you.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.860]   Holy Spirit is the one
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.860]   who convicts of sin.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.860]   John 16, 8,
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.860]   "And when He comes,
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.860]   He will convict the world
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.860]   regarding sin and righteousness
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.860]   and judgment."
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.860]   There's people that you've been praying for
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.860]   and you're thinking of,
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.860]   maybe if I can share this,
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.860]   maybe if I can put them in front
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.860]   of a great apologist
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.860]   or a great preacher
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.860]   or a gifted pastor
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.860]   that maybe they can come to Christ.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.860]   He said, "No, it's the Holy Spirit."
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.860]   Holy Spirit is the one
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.860]   who's going to convict of sin.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.860]   The Holy Spirit is the one
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.860]   who gives new birth.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.860]   In John 3, 5-6,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.860]   Jesus answered,
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.860]   "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   unless someone is born of the water
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.860]   and the Spirit,
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.860]   he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.860]   It's the Holy Spirit
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:41.860]   that gives us new life.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.860]   And then, finally,
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.860]   it is the Spirit
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.860]   that is the source of the living water.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.860]   In John 7, 37-39,
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.860]   "Now on the last day,
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   the great day of the feast,
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.860]   Jesus stood and cried out, saying,
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.860]   'If anyone is thirsty,
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.860]   let him come to Me and drink.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:57.860]   The one who believes in Me,
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.860]   as the Scripture said,
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.860]   from his innermost being
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.860]   will flow rivers of living water.'
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.860]   But this He said
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.860]   in reference to the Spirit."
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.860]   So when He talked about the living water,
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.860]   He's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.860]   He's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.860]   Jesus said,
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.860]   "If you eat the bread
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   that you can get from this world,
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.860]   you will eat and be satisfied for a minute,
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.860]   then you're going to have to keep getting it
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.860]   over and over again."
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.860]   But He said,
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.860]   "I am the bread of life.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.860]   If you eat of My bread,
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   you will never go hungry again."
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.860]   He told the Samaritan woman
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   who was looking for peace
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   because she is wrought in sin,
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.860]   "You're going to keep drinking of this water,
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   but the water that I give you
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.860]   will well up into eternal life.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.860]   And if you drink of it,
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   you will never thirst again."
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.860]   And He says all of that
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.860]   in reference to the Holy Spirit.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.860]   We ask for comfort,
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.860]   and He gives the comforter.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.860]   We ask for help,
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.860]   He gives the helper.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.860]   We ask for power and courage,
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.860]   and He gives us the source of power
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   when the Holy Spirit comes upon us.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.860]   We ask for guidance,
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.860]   and the Spirit of truth is given to us.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.860]   We're constantly praying
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.860]   to be more loving and patient
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.860]   and kind and gentle.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860]   And He said,
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.860]   "When you have the Holy Spirit,
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   those are just the fruit of the Holy Spirit."
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.860]   In other words,
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.860]   you know what He's saying?
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.860]   If you come and ask, seek, and knock,
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:41.860]   the ultimate gift is Himself.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:46.860]   The ultimate gift of salvation isn't heaven.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:51.860]   It isn't salvation from hell.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   Heaven is heaven
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.860]   because that's where Jesus is.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.860]   Hell is hell
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   because that's where separation happens,
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.860]   the secret separation happens.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.860]   The gift of salvation is Jesus Himself.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.860]   All that we long for and desire
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   and that we covet in this world,
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   Jesus is not simply an avenue to get bread.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.860]   He's not just an avenue for peace.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.860]   He's not just a place that we go through
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.860]   to get to a refuge.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.860]   Jesus says, "I am the way.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   I am the truth.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   I am the life.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.860]   I have come to give life
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   and to give this life abundantly."
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.860]   He came to give Himself.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.860]   Only people who recognize that
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.860]   and believe that
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   will seek Him diligently.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   Him diligently.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   Not the circumstance.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.860]   Not friendship.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.860]   Not comfort.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   Not peace.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.860]   But Him.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.860]   Because along with Him
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.860]   comes everything else.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   I pray that our church would recognize
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   the treasure of what we have in Christ.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.860]   What we already have in Christ.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.860]   That we would stop looking to the world
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.860]   to fill our emptiness.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.860]   Stop coming to the Lord and asking,
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.860]   being frustrated because He's not giving us
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.860]   what we covet in this world.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.860]   But that you and I would come to recognize
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   which is Christ Himself.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   That we would long for Him.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.860]   That we would wrestle with Him.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.860]   That we would ask Him.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   We would seek Him and knock for Him.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.860]   That we may have Him more and more.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.860]   Let's pray.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.860]   Heavenly Father,
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.860]   help us to hear Your voice.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.860]   Lord, if our vision for You
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.860]   had been muddied and clouded,
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.860]   because we've allowed ourselves, Lord God,
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.860]   to be so entangled
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.860]   with the civilian affairs of this world.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   Open our eyes and soften our heart, Lord God,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.860]   that we may see the glory that You've shown us.
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.860]   Open our eyes and soften our heart, Lord God,
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:16.860]   that we may see the glory that You've shown us.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   That we may remember the height
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   from which we had fallen.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   That we would repent
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:21.860]   and we would do the things
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   that You called us to do.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.860]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   to not to simply profess our love for You,
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   but that we would deeply fall in love with You.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.860]   That You would be our treasure.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:37.860]   You would be our refuge.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.860]   That You would be our home.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.860]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   [music]
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:09:09.860]   Before the throne,
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:14.860]   before the throne of God above,
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.860]   I have a strong and perfect plea
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.860]   A great high priest
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   whose name is love
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   Whoever lives and pleads for me
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   My name is graven on His hands
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:40.860]   My name is printed on His heart
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:45.860]   I know that while in heaven He stands
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.860]   No tongue can bend me this deep, Lord
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.860]   No tongue can bend me this deep, Lord
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.860]   [music]
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   When Satan tempts me to despair
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.860]   And tells me of the guilt within
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.860]   What would I lack and see in Him
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:23.860]   Who made an end to all my sin
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:28.860]   Because I said let us stand your ground
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.860]   My sinful soul is counted free
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:38.860]   For God the just is satisfied
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:43.860]   To look on Him and pardon me
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.860]   To look on Him and pardon me
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   [music]
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   [music]
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:11:07.860]   He holds it in there
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.860]   He holds it in there
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.860]   The reason why
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:17.860]   My perfect spotless righteousness
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:22.860]   The great unchangeable I am
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:27.860]   The King of glory and of grace
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:32.860]   For with Himself I cannot die
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:38.860]   My soul is purchased by His blood
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   My life is given Christ on earth
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   Because my Savior and my God
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   Because my Savior and my God
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   For with Himself I cannot die
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.860]   My soul is purchased by His blood
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.860]   My life is given Christ on earth
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:13.860]   Because my Savior and my God
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:20.860]   Because my Savior and my God
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860]   Let's pray.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:29.860]   Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.860]   and to make you stand in the presence of His glory
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.860]   blameless with great joy
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.860]   to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.860]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:45.860]   before all time and now and forever. Amen.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.860]   [music]
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:51.860]   God sends His Son
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:57.860]   the golden Jesus
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:03.860]   He came to the earth
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.860]   He left no man
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   He lived and died
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:20.860]   to buy my heart
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:25.860]   and He gave His life to
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:31.860]   my Savior and His
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.860]   Because He lives
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:42.860]   I can face tomorrow
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:47.860]   Because He lives
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:53.860]   all fear is gone
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   Because I know
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:03.860]   He holds the future
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.860]   and life is worth the living
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   Just because He lives
