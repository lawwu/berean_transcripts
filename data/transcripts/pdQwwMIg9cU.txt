[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   you
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   because
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   because the room is going to be packed
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   we can't have
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   spaces in between
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   and so we're expecting
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   anywhere from 8 to 900
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   this room can only fit 550
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.960]   so we need you guys to
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.960]   squeeze in so if you have
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   spaces, if you're up in the front
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   if you can come all the way up to the front
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   just leave a few space for the pastors
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   but outside of that
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   if you guys can squeeze in
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   then the ushers don't have to come and move you guys
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   later on, so just kind of
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   if you're up in the front, if you don't mind
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   some of you guys, some of you who are a little bit younger
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   just squeeze up into the very front
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   seats, if you are coming in
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   try to squeeze in, don't leave 2-3 spots
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   in between
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   or else in the middle of the service
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   we're going to have to ask you to stand up so other people can get in
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   so might as well do it now, okay
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   alright, thank you

[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   [music]
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   Every year,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   we set aside
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   this time, the whole
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   week, and I know some of you guys
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   have been coming the whole week, and this is your
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   including the Passover
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   meal, today is your fifth day, and I know
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   some of you guys may be a little bit fatigued,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   but the reason why this is so important
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   is that there are certain things that
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   we can get away with, it becomes dry
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   and old. Whether it's your
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   clothing, or maybe it's
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   certain hobbies that you have,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   but the centrality of the cross
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   in our lives, as soon as it becomes
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   burdensome, or it becomes mundane,
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   it affects everything
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   that we do. It affects our worship,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   it affects
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   our fellowship, affects the church,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   it affects the way we live, it affects
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   our marriage, it affects the way we
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   raise our children, and so
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   being lukewarm to
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   the death and resurrection
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   of Jesus Christ is not an option for
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   a Christian, and so
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   this is something that we
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   ought to be wrestling with every day of the
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   year, but especially as we come to
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   remember Christ's suffering on the
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   cross and his resurrection on Sunday,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   that we want to take this time and set it
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   aside, not just this period on
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Friday night, or Saturday, or
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   the other days, but
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   to really reflect and to come before
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   God with eager hearts, when the Lord said
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   those who seek Him
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   with all their hearts, He says,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   He will be found, and that we
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   determine in our hearts that we're going to seek Him with all
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   our hearts, and that's why we gather here together
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   this evening. I want to read the
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   account of Jesus' crucifixion with
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   you. It's a little bit long, but I think
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   it's worthwhile
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   for us to remember the details of
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   what happened in Mark chapter 16,
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   15. I'm going to be starting
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   to read from verse 16.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   The soldiers took Him away
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   into the palace, that is the praetorium,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   and they called together the whole Roman cohort.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   They dressed Him up in purple,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   and after twisting a crown of thorns,
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   they put it on Him, and they began
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   to acclaim Him, "Hail,
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   King of the Jews!" They keep
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   beating His head with a reed,
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   and spitting on Him, and kneeling
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   and bowing before Him.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   After they had mocked Him, they took the purple
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   robe off Him and put His own garments
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   on Him, and they led Him out
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   to crucify Him. They
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   pressed into service a passerby
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   the father of Alexander and Rufus,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   to bear His cross.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   Then they brought Him to the place Golgotha,
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   which is translated "place of skull."
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   They tried to give Him wine mixed
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   with myrrh, but He did not take it.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   And they crucified Him,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   and divided up His garments among themselves,
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   casting lots for them to decide
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   what each man should take.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   It was the third hour when they crucified
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   Him. The inscription on the charge against
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   Him read, "The King of the Jews."
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   They crucified two robbers
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   with Him, one on His right,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   one on His left. And the scripture
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   was fulfilled, which says, "And He
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   was numbered with transgressors."
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.960]   Those passing by were hurling
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   abuse at Him, wagging
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   their heads
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   and saying, "Ha!
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   You are going to destroy the temple
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   and rebuild it in three days. Save
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   yourself, and come down from
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   the cross." In the same way,
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   the chief priests also, along with the scribes,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   were mocking Him among themselves and saying,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   "He saved others.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   Why should He save Himself?
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   Let this Christ, the King of Israel,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   now come down from the cross
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   so that we may see and believe."
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   Those who were crucified with Him
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   were also insulting Him.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.960]   When the sixth hour came, darkness
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   fell over the whole land until the ninth
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   hour. At the ninth hour, Jesus
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   cried out with a loud voice,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   "Eloi, Eloi, l'mak s'vachtani,"
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   which is translated, "My God,
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.960]   my God, why have you forsaken
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   me?" When some of the
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   visitors heard it, they began saying, "Behold,
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   he is calling for Elijah."
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   Someone ran and filled a sponge with
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.960]   sour wine, put it on a reed,
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.960]   and gave him a drink, saying, "Let us
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   see whether Elijah will come to take
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   him down." And Jesus uttered
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.960]   a loud cry and breathed his last,
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   and the veil of the temple was torn
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   in two from top to bottom.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   When the centurion, who was standing
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   right in front of Him, saw the way he
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   breathed his last, he said,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   "Truly, this man was the
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   Son of God." Let's pray.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   Father,
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   we've come together
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   to remember,
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   to celebrate,
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   and to praise you
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   for what you have done.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Lord, you know how easily we
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   forget,
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   how easily we get entangled
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   with civilian affairs.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   I pray that you would
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   use this time, use
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   our gathering, use this week
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   to bring revival in our
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   own hearts. Help
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   us, Lord God, to remember the height from
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   which we had fallen,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   and that we would repent,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   that we would redo the things,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   Lord God,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   that you have called us to do.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.960]   Help us, Lord, to sing
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   these songs
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   with true praise.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   Help us, Lord God, to be attentive,
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   to listen carefully,
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   Father God, to remember
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   again afresh
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   why it is that we are here,
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   that we would celebrate in the communion,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   that we would remember the
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   sacrifice of Christ, the
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   suffering that He went through,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   that our sins may be atoned for,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.960]   that we may be reconciled
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   with you. May
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   this evening be revival in our hearts.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   Lord, we
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   come. Lord,
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   we come, Father God,
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   to draw near to you.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   Amen.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   Let's all stand for worship.

[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   where streams of grace
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   flows deep and wide.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   flows deep and wide.

[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   I've ever
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   found
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   comes like a flood,
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   comes
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   falling down.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960]   falling down.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   At
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   the cross,
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   at the cross,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   I surrender
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   my life. I'm in
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   awe of you.

[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   of you.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   May your blood

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   my sin wash
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.960]   white. I owe
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.960]   all to you.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   I owe all to

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.960]   Save from wrath
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   and make me
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   pure.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   Not the labor
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   of my hands
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   can
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   fulfill thy
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   lost demands.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   Could my
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   zeal no respite
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   know?
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   Could my tears
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   forever flow?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   All
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   could ever
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   sin atone.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   Thou must save
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   and thou alone.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   Nothing in my hand
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   I bring.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   Nothing in my
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   brain.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   Simply to
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   the cost I pay.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   Make it
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   come to thee
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   for dress.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   Helpless love
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   to thee for grace.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   Foul
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   I too have
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   found to fly.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   Wash me
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   state, O Lord,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.960]   I die.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   [instrumental]
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   Apologize to me.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.960]   Apologize
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   lady,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   man.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   When mine eyes
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   shall close in death.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   When I
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   soar to
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.960]   earth to come.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   See thee
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   all I've just
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   become.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   Rock of ages
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   left for me.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.960]   Let me
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   hide myself
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   in thee.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   [instrumental]
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.960]   Rock of ages
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   left for me.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   Let me
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   hide myself
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.960]   in thee.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   Let me pray for us before we begin.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   [clears throat]
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   Father, we pray that you
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   would give us ears to hear.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   Help us, Lord
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   God, to have hearts
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   that are easily molded.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   And will, Father
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   God, that desires
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   to surrender.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   I pray by the power
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   of your spirit, Lord God, that you would
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   anoint this time.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   That you would renew the hearts of your
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   people. That you would
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   restore proper praise.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   That you would restore worship
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.960]   and lordship, Lord
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   God, into your church.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   That there would be a greater
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.960]   hunger, Father God,
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   to know you, to come to you, to praise you,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   and to proclaim you in this
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   church and in our generation.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   I pray that you would bless
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   this time by the power of your spirit,
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.960]   Lord God. Speak to us. In Jesus' name we
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   pray. Amen.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   [silence]
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.960]   In our generation,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   there's a lot of discussion about the deity
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   of Christ. Can you be
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   a Christian if you still do not believe
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   that Jesus is God? That he was a
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   good moral teacher. He was a man
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   who did great things. Clearly
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   he made a huge impact on human history.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   But is he truly God?
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   If you look at the
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   early church, for the first
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   three, four hundred years,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   what they
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   debated in the early
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   church was not the deity of Christ, but
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   his humanity.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   The reason why they never
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.960]   really wrestled with his deity
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   is because
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   eyewitnesses in the first century
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   who saw the resurrection of Christ
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   existed in the first century.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   There were people who saw lame people walk.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   They had eyewitnesses
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   of Lazarus who was raised from the dead.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   So clearly,
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   he was not any ordinary man.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   So they didn't have to be convinced about
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   the deity of Christ because they saw his power
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   and his miracles. So the thing
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   that they debated in the early church is, how
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   can a man who's done that be a man?
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.960]   How can a man
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.960]   who raises somebody from the dead,
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   how can somebody who dies
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   and is crucified and be
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.960]   raised and shows himself to 500 people,
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   how can that be a human
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   being? And it
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   took years of wrestling
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   and struggling about the identity of
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.960]   Christ in the early church.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.960]   There is no other time
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   in Jesus' life where Jesus looks
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.960]   more human than any other time.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.960]   We've been studying through the
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.960]   Gospel of Luke, and Luke
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   emphasizes the humanity of Christ
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.960]   more than the other Gospels. But
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.960]   even in the Gospel of Luke,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   we've seen the power
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   of Jesus walking on water,
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.960]   feeding 5,000.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   Just by his one word
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   he can get the storm to
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   stop.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   But it is Jesus
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   and as he is beaten
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   and crucified, and as he
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.960]   breathes his last breath,
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.960]   no other time in Jesus'
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   life where he seems more human
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.960]   than any other time.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   In Matthew 26, 37
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   to 39, Jesus
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.960]   at the Garden
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.960]   of Gethsemane, it says, and he took
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   with him Peter and two sons of
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960]   Zebedee and began to be grieved and
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.960]   be distressed.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   And he said to them, "My soul is deeply
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   grieved to the point of death.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   Remain here and keep watch
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   with me."
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.960]   As Jesus knew that the whole reason
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   why he came
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   was for this reason.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   Now he is a few
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   hours before he is crucified,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   and he is grieving,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   and he is distressed
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   like any other human being
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   would be.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.960]   It says in 39, and he went
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   a little bit beyond and fell on his face
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.960]   and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.960]   possible, let this cup pass
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.960]   from me, yet not as I
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   will, but as you will."
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.960]   He came for this.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.960]   He prophesied this.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.960]   He told his disciples,
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   "We're going to Jerusalem, and this is going to happen."
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   But as he is about to
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   face his crucifixion,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.960]   he has an honest human
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   prayer before his Father.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.960]   Is there
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   another way?
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.960]   Because he saw the pain
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   and suffering coming.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Just like any other human being,
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   we see the weakness
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   of our Savior.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   More than any other period, probably
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   in human history.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   This is a very strange scene.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   Not only is he
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   the King of kings and Lord of lords,
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   he is the creator of the universe.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.960]   All things are sustained because of him.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.960]   And yet
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   he is at the Garden of Gethsemane praying
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   so fervently, it says,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   that his sweat turns to blood.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.960]   And his prayer
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   was,
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   "Is there another way?"
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   We call this
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   week the Passion Week.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   The word for "passion,"
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.960]   the reason why we call it the Passion Week,
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   is because the word in Greek for
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   suffering is "paskal."
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   It's not because
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   there are strong emotions, obviously there are strong
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   emotions, but we call it Passion Week because
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   this is the week that we remember
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   the suffering of Christ.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.960]   And obviously it culminates to what we are
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   celebrating or remembering today.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   It's the suffering of Christ.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   Now,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   we have to be careful
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   that when we study the suffering
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.960]   of Christ, that we don't study it
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   like you study any other history.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   That this isn't something that
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.960]   happened many years ago and has something
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   to do with us.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   This is the history
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   of our Savior
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   who did this for me.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   For me.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   For you.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Because of your sins.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.960]   Because of my sins.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   This is not just any history.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   This is our history.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.960]   His suffering, His struggling,
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   His prayer was all
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.960]   because of us.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   In what way did He suffer?
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   I'm going to look at
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   three separate things
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   so that we can
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   understand the depth of His suffering.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   And hopefully the goal of this
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   evening is as we understand the depth
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   of His suffering,
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   that we would recognize what it is
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   exactly that we are going to commemorate
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   this evening in the communion.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.960]   First of all, His suffering was physical and
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.960]   spiritual. I know that
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   many of you have been Christians for
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   a while that you've seen movies
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   of Jesus' crucifixion and
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   you've heard many stories of His
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   crucifixion. You've probably even heard details
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   about His crucifixion.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   And as a result of that
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   you may have become numb to it.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   You may have become
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   numb to the fact that
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   the Son of God
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   came and suffered for us, but
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   I think it is important that
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   we remember exactly what He went through.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   Crucifixion was one of the
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   most excruciating ways to die.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   It was invented by the
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   Persians in the 6th century B.C.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   And the whole purpose of why they did it
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   was to deter
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   any enemies
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   in order to eradicate anyone who
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   will rebel against the nation.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   So they deliberately made it
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   humiliating. They deliberately
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.960]   made it that even if you did get the death
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   sentence, that
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.960]   you wouldn't get this.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   It was reserved for slaves,
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   for political
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   rebels.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.960]   The victims were typically flogged.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   Not an ordinary whip,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   but a whip
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.960]   that had the teeth of animal bones
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   at the end so that every time you got
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   hit it would strip
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   the skin off of your bones.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   Oftentimes the beating itself
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   would cause
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   people to die.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   And the reason why they did that,
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   one, is to make it public so that
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   people who are watching this would see
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.960]   that if you ever,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.960]   if you ever do anything against the state,
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.960]   this is what's waiting for you.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.960]   They did this publicly.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   And then to weaken
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   them because of what the true
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   suffering was going to come at the cross.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.960]   After getting
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   39 lashes, because
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   40 lashes would be a death sentence,
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   they would make
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   the prisoner
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.960]   carry his own cross,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   which would have been anywhere from 100 to
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.960]   150 pounds, on his
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.960]   own shoulders, publicly
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.960]   dragging this
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   for everybody, all your family and friends
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   and neighbors and strangers would
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   come out to watch.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   What could this man have
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   possibly done that he would deserve this?
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   After he would drag
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   this being
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   to the place of his death,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   they would
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   nail him with five to seven inch
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   spikes through the wrists
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   and through
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   the feet, typically
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   in the ankle area.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   And the reason why they did that is because
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   as they're hanging, they don't want it to rip
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   and slip off.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   Because part of the punishment was
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   to hang on the cross as long as possible.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   And then on top of that,
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   as he is hanging
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.960]   in this excruciating pain,
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   they wanted it to last as long
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   as possible, so they put a little seat
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   under his bottom
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   so that his desire
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.960]   to breathe, that he would
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   be able to lift himself up even for one
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   more breath.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.960]   And this would last anywhere
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   from
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.960]   a day to four or five
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   days.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   Just hanging on the cross.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   Knowing that he's going to die,
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   that he
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   would force himself to catch
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   just another breath.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   And he would gasp for his breath, and then he
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   would slump, and he would gasp for his breath, and then he would slump.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   And this would last four to five days,
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   typically. Eventually,
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   crucifixion was
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   outlawed
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.960]   because Emperor Constantine
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.960]   came in and said, "This is much
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   too inhumane."
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:23.960]   You can imagine
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   why
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   Jesus prayed. He's there
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.960]   all the way.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   You know, we don't actually
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.960]   even have to imagine because
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   the scripture records Jesus'
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   words on the cross.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.960]   We know that at the end,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.960]   before he gives his
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   life up, he cries out, "My God,
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.960]   my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   And it's a direct quote from
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   Psalm 22. Psalm 22
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.960]   is a psalm of David in his distress.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   He's crying out to God, but most
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   theologians believe, and you will,
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   I think, will come to agree when we read it,
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   that Psalm 22 is an
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.960]   account of Jesus on the cross
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   crying out to his
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.960]   father. We don't have to imagine
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.960]   what he was thinking because it records
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   it for us. Psalm 22,
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   1 and 2 says, "My God, my God,
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   why have you forsaken me?
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   Far from my deliverance are the
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   words of my groaning.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.960]   My God, I cry by day,
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.960]   but you do not answer,
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.960]   and by night, but I have
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.960]   no rest."
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.960]   Verse 14, "I am poured
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   out like water," meaning he's
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   dying. "All of my
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   bones are out of joint.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   My heart is like
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.960]   wax. It is melted
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.960]   within me, my strength
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   dried up like potsherd."
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.960]   And this is,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   this is a description
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   of as he is wrestling
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   and as he is fighting
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   for his breath and in pain,
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   he says, "My life is being dried up.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   My tongue cleaves to my jaws.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   I'm thirsty. You lay me
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   in the dust of death, for dogs have
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.960]   surrounded me. A band of evildoers
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.960]   have encompassed me. They
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   pierced my hands and my
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.960]   feet. I can
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   count all my bones.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   They look, they stare at me.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   They divide my garments
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   among them, and for my
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.960]   clothing they cast lots."
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.960]   All four of the
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   Gospels record
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   Jesus crying out.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   In
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   his own words, Psalm 22,
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   describing
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   for us
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.960]   his suffering, Isaiah 53,
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   3, "He was
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   despised and forsaken of men,
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   a man of sorrows and
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.960]   acquainted with grief, and like one
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   from whom men hide their face,
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   he was despised
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   and we did not esteem him."
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.960]   Jesus came to suffer.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.960]   Every
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   part of his life was suffering.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   From the moment that he was
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   born,
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   just the fact that he had to humble
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.960]   himself, he emptied himself. This is
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   God, King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.960]   And he was mocked the whole
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   way.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   But
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.960]   the suffering
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   doesn't end with the physical,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   and just on the cross.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   His
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.960]   suffering was
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   much deeper than that.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   Because he
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.960]   suffered for those who didn't deserve it. He
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   suffered for us, the unrighteous.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.960]   Have you ever
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.960]   suffered
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   for the sake of somebody
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   who's deliberately trying to harm
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   you?
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   I mean, if somebody wrongs us,
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   our struggle isn't love.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   We don't struggle
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   with loving somebody who's deliberately trying
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   to hurt us. We struggle
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   with not carrying out vengeance.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   Christ suffered
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.960]   because he loved
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   those who are hostile toward him.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   Every single one of us knows what it feels
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   like to have somebody against us.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.960]   Who's actively trying to
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.960]   destroy you, your reputation. Maybe
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   they're doing something physical to you.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   But the fact that
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   he suffered what he suffered
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   for the unrighteous, for sinners.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   Now,
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   I've already shared with you,
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   you know, the years that
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   we're going out to homeless ministry,
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   I don't know how many
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   days I came back home thinking,
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   "I'm not sure how long I'm going to be able to do this."
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   You know,
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   I spent the little money
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   that I had to prepare food,
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   gather clothing,
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   and then some days they would be thankful,
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   and then every once in a while, somebody would
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   curse me out because
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   I didn't bring enough.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   Or maybe it wasn't organized enough.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   Maybe the pants didn't fit that way. And then at the
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   end of the day, after laboring
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   for two, three hours and sacrificing,
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   and then I would, before I get in my car,
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   I hear somebody cussing me out. And the whole
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   drive home thinking,
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.960]   "I don't want to come back here next week."
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   Years I had to wrestle through that.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   How do you love people like that?
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.960]   Romans 5, 6-7
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   said, "For while we were still helpless,
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   at the right time, Christ died for
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   the ungodly.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   For one will hardly die for a righteous
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   man, though perhaps for the good man, someone
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   would dare even to die.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   But God
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   demonstrates His love toward us, and that while we were yet
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   Suffering for your
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   own sins
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   would be excruciatingly painful.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   But then to
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   go through this for the ungodly,
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   go through this for the ungrateful,
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.960]   for the blasphemers, for the
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.960]   sinners, for the murderers, for the
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.960]   liars.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   Romans 7-13
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   it tells us the whole reason why
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960]   He gave the law is so that the
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   sin would become utterly
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   sinful.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   You know why sin needed to be
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   utterly sinful?
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   So that you would recognize what
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960]   it is exactly that Jesus has done.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   Why the cross
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   was necessary.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   Until
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   we recognize
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   the corruption of our own
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.960]   heart, cross is
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960]   just a nice, beautiful story.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.960]   This is just something that we remember. I don't
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   forget this. Jesus died for me on the cross.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   We sing great songs, and it gives us
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960]   encouragement so that we can live a better life.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.960]   But until
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960]   the sin and the corruption in us is
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   utterly sinful,
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   you won't fully understand
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960]   what it is that we celebrate today.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.960]   In Romans chapter 3
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960]   10-13, Apostle Paul
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.960]   is surgically using
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.960]   the gospel to bring them
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   to the point where whether they were
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960]   Jews or Gentiles, they
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   come to the point where they understood
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.960]   just how
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960]   sinful they were.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   So Romans chapter 3 10-18
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   is the doctor.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   Doctor of our soul
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   basically giving
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   the diagnosis for the sinners.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   Here's what he says.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960]   "As it is written, there is none righteous,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960]   not even one.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960]   There is none who understands.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   There is none who seeks for God.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   All have turned aside together.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960]   They have become useless. There is none who does good.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960]   There is not even one.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   Their throat is an open grave.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   With their tongues they keep deceiving.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   The poison of ass is under their lips,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960]   Destruction and misery are in their paths,
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   a path of peace they have not known.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   There is no fear of God
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   before their eyes."
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.960]   You may read that and think,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   "Well, you know, maybe there's some people who
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   might qualify.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   Maybe it was the Jews. Maybe it was the Gentiles.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960]   Maybe it's the sex traffickers,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960]   the prostitutes, the tax collectors."
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   Paul says,
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   All! Jew,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   Gentile, Pharisee, Sadducee,
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960]   tax collectors.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960]   Every single one. This is a description of
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   all mankind.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   If you remember
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960]   the sin of David,
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960]   here's a king that was
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   anointed by God, specially chosen
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   to represent him.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   He said, "This is a man after my own heart."
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   And David
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   commits a grievous sin.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960]   He takes someone
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   else's wife. In order to cover it up,
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960]   he kills her husband.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960]   A man who was loyal to him.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   I mean, it is as
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   heinous as you can possibly think
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   a man in his position can carry out.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.960]   And David, a man of God,
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   loved by God, anointed by God,
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960]   chose
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960]   to do this.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   But the problem with this is,
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960]   he's a king.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   Who's going to call him out?
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   Who's going to
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.960]   say anything?
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960]   Well,
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960]   David probably thought that he got away
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   with it.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960]   He took his wife
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960]   and killed her husband,
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960]   had children, and
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960]   was living a good life as a king.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   But the problem
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   is,
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   he was not the final king.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   In
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   Israel, there was a king above him.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960]   So he sends a prophet, Nathan,
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   in order
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   to show him
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960]   the corruption of his heart.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   But he doesn't tell him directly. In 2 Samuel
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960]   chapter 12,
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   Nathan presents
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960]   to him. He says, "David,
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960]   let me tell you a story
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960]   how this
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.960]   one man who was so rich,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   and his
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   field was filled
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   with lambs, and he was a very wealthy
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960]   man. And then he was
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960]   this poor farmer who had
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960]   one lamb
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960]   that he loved since he was a child. And he
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   adored and cherished that lamb.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960]   And there's this rich man, because
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960]   just out of convenience,
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   not even out of necessity, just out of convenience,
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   instead of killing
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   what he had, he took the man's
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   lamb and slaughtered it
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960]   and just used it. And then he just went on.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   What do you think about that, David?
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   David, when he hears this, this is
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   his response in verse 5.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   David's anger burned greatly
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.960]   against the man, and he said to Nathan,
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960]   "As the Lord lives, surely
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   the man who has done this deserves to
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.960]   die. He must make restitution
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   for the lamb fourfold, because
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   he did this thing and had no
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   compassion." Nathan
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   then said to David,
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960]   "You are the man."
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   You know why this story is here?
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960]   You know why
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   this story is here?
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.960]   They're not just telling us
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.960]   history.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.960]   This is
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   us.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   This is us.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   Because we don't
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   recognize the depth of our sin.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   And
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   that's why we can go off
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   and live selfishly.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960]   We know
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   we're sinners. We just
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960]   haven't been caught.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   We know there's dark things that we
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   do when the lights are turned off.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   We know the things that we bury deep
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   within, that maybe even our wives
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   or our husbands or our children don't know about.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   We know
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   it's there, but we just haven't been caught.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   The
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   scripture tells us that the law
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   came to reveal the sin,
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.960]   so that you and I would recognize
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   the desperate situation
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   that you and I are in.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   See, Christ not only
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   suffered, but he
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   suffered for sinners,
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960]   like David, like the tax
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   collector, like the Pharisees,
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   who was
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   indignant about other people's sin,
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   but
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   they don't recognize their own.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960]   We
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   don't recognize that we're the tax
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   collectors.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   We're the tax collectors.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   We're the prostitutes.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960]   The corruption
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.960]   in our heart cannot be worked off.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   The
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   whole
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   point of
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   Israel's history was to bring us to the point,
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   "Oh, what a wretched man that I
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.960]   am.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960]   I need a Savior."
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   And the fact that he
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   suffered
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   for unrighteous,
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   rebellious,
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   hypocritical, self-righteous
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   people like me and you,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.960]   if you've ever
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960]   tried to love somebody that is difficult
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   to love,
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   everything in you
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   wants to hate them.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   Everything in you wants to retaliate.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.960]   Everything in you
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   wants to take vengeance.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   Just even not doing
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960]   it kills you.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.960]   And yet,
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   as Christ is hanging on the cross,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   and when he says,
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   "Father, forgive them,"
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   "Father,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   forgive them,"
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   because they don't understand.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   They don't know who they're killing.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.960]   They don't know who they're mocking.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.960]   They don't know why
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   I came.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   They don't know what I'm doing.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.960]   Imagine
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   the suffering.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.960]   But you know,
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   as bad
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   as that is,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960]   the greatest
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   suffering
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   came from the Father himself.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   The greatest suffering
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960]   came from the Father himself.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   In Matthew 27, 45-46,
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   it says, "Now from the sixth hour,
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   darkness fell, which was about twelve
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960]   o'clock, until the land
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.960]   of the ninth hour." So about twelve to three.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960]   Twelve to three.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   It says, "The earth went dark."
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   voice, "My God,
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   my God, why
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   have you forsaken me?"
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   Dr. Harris,
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   in his book, "The Darkness and the Glory,"
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960]   describes why
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.960]   the earth went dark for three hours.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.960]   Many people
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960]   hypothesize
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   that it may
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   have gone dark because God
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   could not watch the suffering of his Son.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.960]   And there's even a song
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   about it, "The Father Turned His Face
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   Away." Dr.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   Harris, in his book,
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   says,
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   "The more logical
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960]   and biblical understanding of this
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   should be that the Father actually came."
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   And I am absolutely convinced that he's correct.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   First of all, anytime a covenant
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   is ratified,
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   God is there.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960]   Whether it is in Genesis chapter 15,
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   where he makes a covenant
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   with Abraham, and Abraham falls asleep,
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   and God appears
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960]   in that covenant.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.960]   Where he is making a covenant
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960]   with Moses, and he appears.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   And Moses is so
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   afraid of his presence that
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960]   he had to be veiled by his presence.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   The scripture says over and over again
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   that if anybody sees
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960]   God, he shall die.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   And it would make perfect sense that God did not just
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960]   hand him over because Satan had no power
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960]   to punish Jesus.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   Satan's not the author of life.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960]   Satan is the accuser.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   He's not the judge.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   He's not the executioner.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   He didn't hand him over.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   The reason why it went dark is because God
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   had to come.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   The Father had to come
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960]   and place our sins
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   upon his Son.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   In fact,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   Isaiah 53.10, it says,
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   "But the Lord was pleased to crush him."
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   The Lord was pleased to crush him,
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   putting him to grief. The Lord did it.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.960]   Mark chapter 14.27,
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   the prophecy of Zechariah
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   13.7, Jesus said to them,
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960]   "You will all fall away because it is written,
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960]   'I will strike down the shepherd,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   and the sheep shall be scattered.'" He says,
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   "I will strike down the shepherd."
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   He didn't say, "I will hand him over."
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960]   "I will strike him down." Isaiah 53.6,
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   "All of us like sheep have gone astray.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960]   Each of us has turned to his own way.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   But the Lord caused the iniquity of us all
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   to fall on him."
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960]   The Lord caused it.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:05.960]   I remember the first time reading that,
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   it just blew my mind.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   That in the darkness,
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   the Father brought
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.960]   the greatest pain.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   All the physical pain,
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   all the suffering of isolation,
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   the humiliation,
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   all of that paled in comparison.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960]   And when
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   Jesus said, "Father, if there is another
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   way," I don't believe that he was just
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.960]   talking about his physical suffering.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   Because the real suffering happened
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   in the darkness.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   Because Christ
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   had to bear
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   our sins,
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   past, present, and future.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.960]   All of it
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   upon himself.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:57.960]   My father,
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   who passed away many years
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   ago,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   he was a very
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   calm man.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   I've never seen him lose his temper.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.960]   I mean, rarely.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   Even when we would get into trouble.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   My dad would never lash out.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   He would calmly say, "What happened?"
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   And then he would bring my brothers into the room
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   and say, "Who started it?"
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   And then he would make us talk it out.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   And even when we needed to get punished,
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   he would just say, "Okay,
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   pull up your pants."
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960]   And then he would say, "How many do you deserve?"
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   And then we'd say, "Three."
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   And then, you know,
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   try to be fair, and then he'd say, "Okay, three."
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960]   And then he'd give us three.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960]   And he would always be calm. He would just
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   rationally just say, "Okay, then what should you do?"
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   "Yeah, you guys slap each other."
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   Right?
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   "Get it out while I'm here."
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   I've never seen him,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960]   even when he punished,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960]   like, really lose it.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   Except one day.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   I was a
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   freshman in high school,
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   and I went to a store,
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   and I wanted to get something for my bike,
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   which was stolen.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   And so,
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   I went to the bike, and I
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   tried to get a wrench that I
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   couldn't afford, so I stole it.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   And I put it in my pants,
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   and I was walking out, and the security guard
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   caught me.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   They called the police,
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   they
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960]   handcuffed me,
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960]   and then they drove me home.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   That was my first time. That was not my last time.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.960]   They drove me home,
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   and obviously, I was
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   like, "I'm going to get it."
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   You know?
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   And if my mom finds out, I'm dead.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   My brother,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   my brother Paul finds out, he's going to kill me.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   I wasn't worried about Phillip.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   Sure enough, I go home, but my mom's not there.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   And my dad happened to be coming home,
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   and the garage door opens,
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960]   and he sees me in the patrol car,
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   in the back seat,
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   and the police is getting
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   me out of the car
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   with my hands cuffed in the back.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   And I could tell my dad was freaking out.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.960]   It was during a period when they were struggling
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.960]   with church, and trying to pay bills,
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.960]   and here's this kid
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   showing up to the house in a police,
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   you know,
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   with handcuffs, and my dad just,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   he didn't know what to do.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   And for the first time, I saw him lose control.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.960]   He told me to
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960]   get on my knees in front of the police officers.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   So I got
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   on my knees. By that time, the handcuffs
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960]   were off, and the officers
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   just watched.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   And he started beating me
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   out of anger.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   So
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960]   I sat there, and I was like,
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   "I deserve it."
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.960]   And I remember
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   he got so angry, he kicked me.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   And this is the first time he's ever
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   laid hands on me out of anger like that.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.960]   The police officers were
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.960]   so, like,
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   they didn't know what to do,
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   so they just left.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   They left me to my dad, and then
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   they left, and then I was sitting there,
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   and about three hours later, they came back and said,
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   "Oh, we forgot to read him his rights."
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   So they knocked on the door, and they
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   read me my rights,
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   and then they left again.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   I was
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960]   surprised, obviously, because I've never seen
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   my dad lose control like that, but
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   I knew I deserved it.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   Because I knew
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   what kind of heartache I was
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   for my parents. I knew
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   how hard they were struggling with their dry
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   cleaner store, and
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   I'd come in like that, and even though
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.960]   I was a young kid, nobody had
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   to convince me that I was a sinner.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   But
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   I don't know what I would have done
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   if I was not guilty.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   If
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.960]   he laid hands on me like that, and I wasn't
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.960]   guilty.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   That probably would
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   have changed my relationship with him.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   It was because I deserved
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   it.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   God, the
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.960]   Father, turns off the
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960]   light.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   Through the whole
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   account of Jesus,
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   God kept on
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   saying, "This is my beloved son,
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   whom I am well pleased."
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960]   He said this at the
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.960]   baptism. He said the same thing at the
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960]   transfiguration. "This is my son, whom I am
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960]   well pleased. I love him."
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   Jesus
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   exclusively called the Father,
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.960]   Father.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   Jesus is called
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   the Son, 45
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   separate times. John 3:16
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   says, "For God so loved
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   the world that he gave his only begotten
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960]   precious Son." John
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   3.35, "The Father loves the Son
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   and has given all things to his hand."
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.960]   John 5.20, "For the Father loves
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   the Son and shows him all things
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   that he himself is doing."
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.960]   John 10.17, "For this
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960]   reason the Father loves me, because I
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960]   lay down my life so that I may take it up again."
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960]   John 15.9, "Just as
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   the Father has loved me, I have
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   also loved you. Abide
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960]   in my love."
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   And at the end of all
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   that, before he goes to the cross, he
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   asks the disciples, "Who
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   do men say that I am?"
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   "You're Elijah, you're the prophet, you're John
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.960]   the Baptist." "Now who do you
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   say that I am?"
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960]   "You're the Christ,
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   the Son of the
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   living God."
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   Because he spent
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   his whole ministry trying to convey
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   his identity to the disciples, and
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   what they knew was, "You're the Son!
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   You're the
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   one that he loves!
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   You're the one that he's pleased
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   with! You're the
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   one!"
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.960]   In Isaiah 53.7 it
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960]   says, "He was oppressed and
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960]   he was afflicted, yet he did not open his
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.960]   mouth. Like a lamb
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.960]   that is led to slaughter,
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   and like a sheep that is silent
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.960]   before his shearers,
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   he did not open his mouth."
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960]   Now that's not completely
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960]   true.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   That's not completely
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   true.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960]   He didn't open his mouth
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.960]   until the very end.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:01.960]   He did open his mouth.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960]   But when he
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   did open his mouth,
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960]   he did not cry
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960]   out to people
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   for crucifying
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   him, saying, "Why are you doing this
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.960]   to me?"
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.960]   He did not cry out to the leaders of
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   Israel. "After
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.960]   all that you have
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960]   been given!
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960]   After all the privilege that you've had!
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.960]   How did you not
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   recognize me? How did you reject me?"
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   He did not cry out to the soldiers
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   who were beating him and mocking him.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   He did not cry out to any
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960]   of them. But he cried out
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   to his father.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   "My God!
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   My God!
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   Why have you forsaken me?"
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   He's never called God
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   God before.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960]   Every single instance in the Bible up to this
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960]   point, he said, "My father! My father!
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   My son!
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960]   My Abba Father!"
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   And as he took
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.960]   the sins of the world upon himself,
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   as God
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   punished him for our sins,
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   that pain was so excruciating,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   he finally
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   opened his mouth.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   And when he opened his mouth,
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   he said, "My God!
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.960]   My God!
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   Why have you forsaken
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960]   me?"
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   The question that we should be asking
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   --
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   the question that you and I
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   should be asking, if we really understand
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   what it is that he's done for us and who it is
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.960]   that we are --
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   we should be asking,
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960]   "My God! My God!
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   Why
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   have you not forsaken
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   me?
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   Why have you not forsaken me?
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   I know my sins.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   I know
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   my hypocrisy.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   Even after all these years,
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   why does he
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   put up with me?
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   Why does he love me?
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   Why didn't he discard me?
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   Why does he persevere with me?
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   You know your sins.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   You know we don't deserve
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   him.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   It's because we could not.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   He did.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   This is why we're here today.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   My hope
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   and prayer,
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   not just in our church,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   but in our generation,
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960]   that
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   Jesus would receive
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   Jesus would
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   receive
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   the glory that he deserves.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   That you would come
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   to church to praise his name.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.960]   That you would magnify
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   this God who forsook everything
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   for me and you who didn't deserve it.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.960]   Who took the punishment,
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   the wrath of God that you and I
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960]   deserved.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.960]   Took it upon himself.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   That you and I would become
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   worshipers.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   Who worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   Choose.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   Choose you this day
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   who you will serve.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   Stop
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   teeter-tottering between two opinions.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.960]   If the world
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   is what you covet,
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   make up your mind.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   Go for it.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   But if it is God
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   that you will serve,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   make up your mind.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.960]   Take up your cross
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.960]   and follow him.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   Our God
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   deserves
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   all of us.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.960]   Our God deserves our praise.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   Our God deserves
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   our youth.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   Our God deserves our
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.960]   finance.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960]   Our God deserves our life.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.960]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.960]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.960]   They're going to lead us in a praise song.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   And we're going to open up
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960]   the communion table right after.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.960]   And I'm going to ask you.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   If your heart
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   has become
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   dull,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   you don't know
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   how detestable that is before God's eyes.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.960]   Imagine
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.960]   if I gave you my
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   son that you didn't
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   deserve and you
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960]   receive him kind of like, "Thank you, Jesus."
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   That's why
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   lukewarmness is so offensive to God.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.960]   Either you receive him, you believe him,
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   and you give him your life and you follow him with all your
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   heart, proclaiming him till the day you die,
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   waiting for glory to come when he
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   comes,
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.960]   or walk away.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.960]   Don't bring shame to the name of God
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   because you want to stay
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   in the middle.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   Let's make up our mind.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.960]   Let's come before the Lord.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Repent.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   You've been living
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   lukewarm. You've had one foot
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   in the door, in the kingdom, the other
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   foot coveting everything that
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   everybody else is coveting.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Repent.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   Turn.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   Remember the height from which we had fallen.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   Repent
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   and do the things that you did at first.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   I pray that as we open up the communion table
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   that you would come
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   prepared.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   Don't do it because it's Friday. Don't do it because it's
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   open. Don't do it because you're here.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960]   Come before the Lord and ask the Lord
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960]   to break your hearts,
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   to cry
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   out and to grieve over your sin.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   You know, when
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   James and John came to
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.960]   Jesus and said,
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   "Would you let us sit to the left or to the right?"
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.960]   Jesus says,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.960]   "Are you able
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   to drink the cup that I drink?"
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   And they
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   in their arrogance said, "Yes."
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   Not knowing.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   Jesus says to them,
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.960]   "You will drink the cup, but to sit in the left
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   or the right is not for me to give you."
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   Now,
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   were the disciples able to
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   drink the cup? Some people will look at that and say,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960]   "Well, they did suffer."
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   But Jesus' cup wasn't just
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   physical suffering.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   Jesus' cup is that
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   he absorbed the wrath of God.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   The disciples could not
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960]   drink of his cup.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.960]   So what did he mean when he said, "You will drink of my cup?"
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.960]   I believe what he meant was,
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   "Because I drank the cup of the wrath of God,
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   you are able to drink the cup
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   of the new covenant."
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   So the reason why you and I
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   are able to participate in this communion table
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   tonight is because
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   Christ took the cup of wrath
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   on our behalf.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.960]   So I pray
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.960]   that as we open up the communion table
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.960]   that the weight of what it is
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   that we're doing would hit us, revive
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960]   us, and renew us.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   Let me pray for us and then we'll
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960]   open up the communion table.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960]   Search us and know us
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   and see if there's any
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.960]   hurtful ways in us.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.960]   Lord, if we've become numb
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960]   to the truth of who you are,
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.960]   if we are compromised,
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   if we have been making excuses,
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   open
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   our eyes, Lord God, that we may see the
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   glory of the gospel of Jesus
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   Christ,
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   that we may encounter you,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960]   that we may know you,
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   that we
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.960]   may follow you.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.960]   We pray, Father
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960]   God, that your name may be honored and glorified
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.960]   and the church may be renewed and
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.960]   revival would come for the purpose
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   of your glory. In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960]   Amen.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   [music]
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960]   Behold the Lamb who
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   bears our sins
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   away, sane
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   for us.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   And
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   we remember
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   the promise
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   made that all
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   who come in
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   faith find forgiveness
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.960]   at
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.960]   the cross.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   So
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]   we share
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960]   in the
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   spread of life
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   and we drink
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960]   of
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   his sacrifice
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960]   as a
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960]   sign
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   of our bonds
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   of peace
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960]   around
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   the table of
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   the King.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.960]   [music]
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   The body
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   of our Savior
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960]   Jesus Christ
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960]   torn for you
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   [music]
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   Eat
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   and remember
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   the wounds that
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   healed the death that
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   brings us life
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.960]   paid the price
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.960]   to make
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.960]   us one.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.960]   So we
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   share
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   in the spread
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.960]   of life
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960]   and we drink
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.960]   of his
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   sacrifice
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.960]   as a sign
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   of
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   our bonds
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.960]   of love
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   around the
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.960]   table of the
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   King.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   [music]
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.960]   The blood that
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.960]   cleanses every stain
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.960]   of sin
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   shed for you
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   [music]
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   Drink and
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.960]   remember
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   he drained death's cup
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.960]   that all may
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   enter in
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   to receive
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   the life of
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.960]   God.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.960]   So we share
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   in the
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.960]   spread of
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   life and we
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   drink
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   of his
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   sacrifice
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   as a sign
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.960]   of
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.960]   our bonds of
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.960]   grace
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.960]   around the table
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   of the King.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   [music]
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.960]   And so with
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   thankfulness and
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   faith we rise
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   to respond
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   [music]
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.960]   and to
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.960]   remember
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   our call to follow
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.960]   in the steps
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.960]   of Christ
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.960]   as his body
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   here on
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   earth.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   As we share
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   in
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   his suffering
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.960]   we proclaim
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   Christ
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.960]   will come
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   again
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.960]   and we'll join
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.960]   in the
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.960]   feast of
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.960]   heaven
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.960]   around the table
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.960]   of the
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.960]   King
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   around the
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.960]   table of the
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.960]   King.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:13.960]   [music]
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.960]   That which I
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   also deliver to you
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   was betrayed took bread
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   and when he had given thanks he broke it and
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   said this is my body which is for you. Do this
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   in remembrance of me.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.960]   In the same way he took the cup also after
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.960]   supper saying this cup is a new covenant
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   in my blood. Do this as
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   often as you drink it in remembrance
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   of me. For as often
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.960]   as you eat this bread and drink the cup
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   If I can ask the leaders to
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.960]   come and open up the communion table
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.960]   and those of you who are in the
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.960]   youth chapel when you are ready
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.960]   please make your way to
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.960]   the cafe area and take your
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.960]   cup and you can go back to your seats.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.960]   I ask again as we take communion if you
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   are here as a guest and you are not a baptized
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.960]   believer in the church that we ask
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.960]   that you would remain seated. There is no special
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   power for taking it. This is
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.960]   a commemoration of what Christ has
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.960]   done to remember Christ so we
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.960]   ask that you remain in your seat
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.960]   if that is not the case. We do have
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.960]   a welcome booth and an outreach
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   table that if you have questions about anything
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   that you heard you can go and
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   one of our pastors and some of
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.960]   our church members will be there to answer your questions
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.960]   so you can go to that. For the rest of
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.960]   you guys if you can come toward the middle
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.960]   and again if you see any
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   lagging or
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.960]   any traffic please
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   make sure that you stand in two
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.960]   separate lines. These aisles are pretty small so
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   we are going to have to move pretty quickly.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   If you are gluten free and if you need
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   special for that
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960]   you can go to the table to my right and to your left.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960]   So again
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.960]   as the worship begins
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.960]   we ask that you would just take some time to pray
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.960]   and when you are ready one by one
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.960]   that you would come to the front.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   (Prayer is sung)
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   (Prayer is sung)

[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:40.940]   >> On a hill far away.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:56.940]   >> On a hill far away stood an Oregon cross, an ember of suffering and shame.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:13.940]   And I love that old cross, where the dearest and best held the world, the lost sinner was slain.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:31.940]   So I'll cherish the Oregon cross, till my trophies at last I lay down.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:47.940]   I will cling to the Oregon cross, and exchange it someday for a crown.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:45:06.940]   In the old rugged cross, in the old rugged cross, stained with blood so deep, I, a wondrous beauty I've seen.
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:23.940]   What was on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died to pardon and sanctify me.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:41.940]   So I'll cherish the Oregon cross, till my trophies at last I lay down.
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:59.940]   I will cling to the Oregon cross, and exchange it someday for a crown.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:16.940]   To the Oregon cross I will ever be true, its shame and reproach gladly bear.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:34.940]   And He'll call me someday to my home far away, where His glory forever I'll share.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:51.940]   So I'll cherish the Oregon cross, till my trophies at last I lay down.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:47:07.940]   I will cling to the Oregon cross, and exchange it someday for a crown.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:26.940]   I will cling to the Oregon cross, and exchange it someday for a crown.
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:30.940]   Before I pray, I have a quick announcement.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:35.940]   For those of you who are helping with the cleanup, they're going to be meeting over there.
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.940]   Oh, at the water fountain.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.940]   Okay, so go to that area.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.940]   And again, if you are visiting us, there is an outreach table set up outside.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.940]   So please go to that after the service.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:52.940]   And then this coming Sunday, obviously, we're going to be continuing our remembrance and celebration of Jesus' resurrection.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.940]   At six o'clock sharp, we're going to be starting our early rise service.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:58.940]   So try to come a little bit earlier.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.940]   After the morning service, we're going to be having breakfast.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.940]   A McDonald's breakfast is going to be served.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:09.940]   And then after the second and third service, we will have lunch provided for the church.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:13.940]   So if you are bringing family and friends, there are resources that you can go.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.940]   The table is going to be set up, but also lunch will be provided.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:22.940]   After the resurrection, early rise service, and then lunch for second and third service.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940]   All right, let's pray.
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:33.940]   Father, we thank you so much for your grace upon grace upon grace.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:41.940]   Lord, help us, Lord, that our hearts would not ever become so callous.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:49.940]   That the suffering that Christ went through for us would never become old news to us.
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:54.940]   But that you would renew us day after day.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:58.940]   And that we would eagerly wait for the coming of Christ.
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:04.940]   That until he comes, that we would shine that light, Lord God, to all those who are around us.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:12.940]   That more and more souls, Lord God, would be able to hear the hope that we have in you.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:19.940]   Lord, we pray, as you warned us, that because of wickedness is going to increase at the end times.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:22.940]   That love is going to grow cold.
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:28.940]   Help us, Lord God, to be on our knees, to wrestle, to struggle.
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.940]   That that would not happen to us.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.940]   That your word would penetrate our hearts.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:36.940]   That your Holy Spirit, Lord God, continue to guide us and lead us.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.940]   That the fellowship of the church will be iron sharpening iron.
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.940]   That you would help us to see the world, Lord God, through your lens.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.940]   Help us to see how desperate we are.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:49.940]   How hopeless we are when we are not near you.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:53.940]   Help us to see the loved ones that are around us that do not know you, Father God.
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:58.940]   If we have become callous because it had been so many years, Lord, that they've resisted you.
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:00.940]   Help us not to lose hope.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:04.940]   Help us, Lord God, to fast, to pray, to seek you with all our hearts.
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:10.940]   That this short life that we have, that we would live it for your glory.
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:18.940]   So we pray that as we continue and go our way, that Sunday morning, Lord, that we would come to celebrate the power of the resurrection.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.940]   That we would come to worship, to celebrate, to sing.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.940]   That all those around the world, all the churches, Lord God, who are preaching the gospel this Sunday.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.940]   That you would anoint it with power.
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.940]   That many, many souls, Lord God, would hear the truth of who you are.
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:38.940]   That you would deliver them from the bondage of Satan.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940]   Open their eyes to the glory of the gospel.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:46.940]   That more souls may come to Christ as a result of your churches redeeming the time.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.940]   So we pray, Father God, that you would make us people of prayer.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.940]   Of much prayer.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:54.940]   To be devoted to prayer.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.940]   That it is only by your will, by your might and your spirit, that we can ever possibly bear fruit.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.940]   So for that end, send us.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.940]   That we may be the aroma of Christ.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.940]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
