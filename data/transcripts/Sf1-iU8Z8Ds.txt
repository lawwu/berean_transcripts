[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   Sing more than I am.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:44.460]   All that I am, all that I have, I've waited down before you, oh Lord.
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:59.800]   All my regrets, all my acclaim, the joy and the pain, I'm making them yours.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   Now, Lord, I offer my life to you, everything I've been through, use it for your glory.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Lord, I offer my days to you, lifting my grace to you.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:40.980]   As a crazy sacrifice, Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.160]   It's in the past.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.120]   It's in the past.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.560]   Things that I'm seeing.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.720]   Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:15.000]   All of my hopes, all of my plans, my heart and my hands are lifted to you.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:31.840]   Lord, I offer my life to you, everything I've been through, use it for your glory.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:45.060]   Lord, I offer my days to you, lifting my grace to you.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:06:06.940]   Lord, I offer my life to you, everything I've been through, use it for your glory.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:18.880]   Lord, I offer my days to you, lifting my grace to you.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:40.940]   Lord, I offer my days to you, everything I've been through, Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.280]   Lord, I offer my days to you, everything I've been through, use it for your glory.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.080]   All right.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.480]   Good morning.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.080]   Welcome to Brink Community Church.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.300]   There's a newcomer's welcome lunch that's happening at 1 p.m. after the second service.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.120]   So please come to the chapel.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.340]   If you want to learn more about the church and meet some of the leaders and the history of the church,
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.760]   that's what they're going to be covering at 1 p.m. at the youth chapel.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.220]   So let them know.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.060]   Again, lunch will be served there.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.140]   And then FAM245, if you're part of the FAM245 ministry,
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.220]   and if you are newly married since 2023, this ministry is for you.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.520]   There is a bowling fellowship that's happening on July 5th, which is this Saturday at 11 a.m.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.980]   So please sign up for that if you are planning to attend that.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.580]   And then they asked me to make a push for July 12th at 9 a.m.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.080]   They are in need of a lot more people to help.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.500]   We've been so caught up with the VBS that we haven't been able to emphasize this.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.380]   But there is a table that are a sign-up table outside.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.260]   So as you're exiting, if you can visit that table and just let them know that you're able to come.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.800]   This is July 12th, not this Saturday, but the Saturday after that at 9 a.m.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.280]   Even if you can come for just a short period, they're asking me that we need to get more people to help.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.940]   Because obviously we've used the whole church facility for VBS.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.760]   They wanted more attention given to kind of getting the church back to where it was and clean up.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.680]   So they're asking for sign-ups for that.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.720]   So if you can come, even a portion of the day, please visit the table as you're exiting.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.940]   And then next members' meeting is happening on July 27th at 2 p.m. in the main sanctuary.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.180]   So please mark that.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.020]   And for whatever reason, if you cannot attend, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:31.300]   And then lastly, our Korea mission team is leaving this Friday on July 4th at night.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.920]   We're having a red eye.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.880]   Most of the team is going to be coming back on the 19th.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.280]   So we're going to be there for two weeks running two English camps, one for boarding school with high school, junior high school students.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.800]   And then the second week, we're actually in the universities reaching out to the campuses.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.140]   And so it's going to be a really packed schedule for the two weeks.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.780]   If you can please keep the team in prayer.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.880]   Again, there's 18 of us that are headed out, and we'll be there for two weeks running two separate camps.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.440]   So please keep them in your prayer, and that will be on July 4th.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.180]   We'll give you updates while we're out in Korea so you can better pray for us, okay?
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.940]   All right, let me pray for the offering.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.740]   Again, if you have a physical offering to give, our offering box is in the back.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.400]   All right, let's pray.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:22.640]   Father, we thank you for your continued grace and love that you pour upon us.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.880]   We thank you, Father God, that you are a God of love and grace and righteousness and justice.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.320]   Help us, Lord God, to know you, to love you, to obey you, and to worship you.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.600]   We pray, Father God, that you will bless the offering that we give,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.540]   that it would be given joyfully and may be multiplied, Father God, for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.260]   Before we stand up, I have, I forgot to announce, after the worship time,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.400]   our sister Diana Choi is going to come up, give the testimony, be baptized this morning.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.400]   Let's all stand up for the, the standing up?
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.960]   No.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.540]   All right, I'm messed up.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:02.840]   Okay.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Thank you.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.460]   Thank you.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.900]   Thank you.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:34.880]   Thank you.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:53.160]   Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:23.140]   Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:53.120]   Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   Praise Him for He is Thy health and salvation.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:14.580]   All He who hear, now to His temple draw near, praise Him in glad adoration.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:30.580]   Praise to the Lord above all things so wondrously rare.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:42.580]   Filters me under His wings are so gently sustainable.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.580]   Amen.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:54.580]   Has thou not seen how thy desires have been?
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.580]   Granted and worthy ordained.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   Praise to the Lord who taught prosper the work and defend Him.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.580]   Surely there's goodness and mercy in your daily attending.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.580]   Surely there's goodness and mercy in your daily attending.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.580]   Surely there's goodness and mercy in your daily attending.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:46.440]   Under anew, under anew, what the Almighty can do, but with His love He befriends you.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   Praise to the Lord, praise to the Lord, all and all that lives in the adornment.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:22.920]   Oh, I have loved you, I've come now with praises before Him.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:37.960]   Thank you, amen, so from His people again, gladly for all we adore Him.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:52.300]   Oh, I have loved you, amen, so from His people again, gladly for all we adore Him.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   Oh, I have loved you, amen, so from His people again.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.600]   Oh, I have loved you, amen, so from His people again.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:21.700]   There is no song we could sing to honor the weight of Your glory.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:31.800]   There are no words we could speak to capture the depth of Your beauty.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:42.900]   Jesus, there's no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:56.000]   There's no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.100]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:14.100]   There is no sin of the arms, the infinite stretch of Your mercy.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:23.200]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:46.300]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:58.400]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:10.500]   There is no one like You, Jesus, we love You, ever adore You, Lord.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:28.600]   All we have, all we need, all we want is You.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:48.700]   All we have, all we need, all we want is You.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:18:11.300]   All we have, all we need, all we want is You.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:17.360]   Jesus, there's no one like you.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.980]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.360]   Ever adore you.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.260]   There's no one like you.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.020]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.340]   Ever adore you.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.320]   There's no one like you.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.000]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.460]   Ever adore you.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.380]   There's no one like you.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.020]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.540]   Ever adore you, Lord.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:19:05.420]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:23.720]   Hi, my name is Diana Choi, and I have been attending Berean with my husband, Travis, and our son, Archer.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.460]   I'm already crying.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:38.060]   I was fortunate to grow up in a Bible-believing church, and I became a believer at an early age in seventh grade at a retreat as the speaker shared the gospel.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.520]   I had heard the gospel before, but this is the first time I was saved by it.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:51.760]   It's the first time I believed that I was dead in my sins, and that I was saved only by the grace of God who sent Jesus to die for my sins.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:20:04.260]   It was a long time ago, over 30 years ago, and it's hard to remember the details, but I remember the feeling of joy and awe that there was nothing I could do to save myself, but that God had provided a way.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:13.220]   I grew up attending church every Sunday, then youth group, then college, and then young adults, and serving every year.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:22.180]   I had a group of friends who were like-minded, and even if we went on vacation together over their weekend, we would find a church to worship at on Sunday.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:32.060]   We didn't even spend money on Sundays in case it caused someone to work on the Sabbath, but the enemy had a very strong foothold in my life.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:42.380]   I have a younger sister who is the opposite of me, much prettier, more athletic, more popular, and has a big gift with children.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:50.520]   And the jealousy in my heart played out in only seeking my dad's approval and in craving male attention.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.800]   And although you couldn't tell from my public life, eventually that sin in my heart came pouring out.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.580]   When I turned 34, I broke.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.380]   I saw that my life wasn't going to be what I wanted it to be, and that I wasn't going to get what I wanted.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:12.860]   And so, I was tired of feeling like the older brother in the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:20.520]   It wasn't a conscious decision to turn my back on God, but I went out looking to fulfill the sinful desires of my heart.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.060]   I dated whoever I wanted and did whatever I wanted.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.800]   I begged for validation and approval from people who did not even treat me with dignity.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:38.600]   And for the first time, I truly experienced what it means to say that every sin leads to death, even in this life.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.360]   I was finally getting what I wanted, and it made me want to die.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.380]   But through my friends at church and through church discipline, God brought me to repentance.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.340]   It was a stark picture of the depth of my sin and my need for God in order to live.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:02.220]   And it was so painful, but it was from God, and it was the kind of pain that brought me to life.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.720]   God continues to pursue me every day.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:11.800]   God continues to show me a new depth to my sin and the never-ending depth of his love.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.060]   He shows me over and over how he has redeemed me.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:21.320]   The Bible verse that helps me navigate this most is Proverbs 3, 5 to 6.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.680]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.900]   In all your ways, acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.200]   I grew up in a Presbyterian church and was baptized as an infant.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:41.580]   It's been odd to think about getting baptized so many years after my conversion, but wonderfully so.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.120]   It is another sign of God's intention in my life, and I am excited to be baptized today.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.960]   Thank you.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.020]   Thank you.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:34.760]   Alright, thank you, Diana.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 11, we're going to be reading from verse 45.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.480]   All the way down to verse 54.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:48.940]   Luke chapter 11, verse 45 through 54.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.640]   One of the lawyers said to him in reply,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.260]   Teacher, when you say this, you insult us too.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.040]   But he said,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.380]   Woe to you, lawyers, as well, for you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.720]   while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.740]   Woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets,
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.000]   and it was your fathers who killed them.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.680]   So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.900]   because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.320]   For this reason also the wisdom of God said,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.360]   I will send to them prophets and apostles,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.880]   and some of them they will kill,
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.580]   and some they will persecute.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.100]   So that the blood of all prophets shed since the foundation of the world
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.980]   may be charged against this generation.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.240]   From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.580]   who was killed between the altar and the house of God,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.620]   yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.060]   Woe to you, lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.860]   You yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.280]   When he left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.220]   and to question him closely on many subjects,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.200]   plotting against him to catch him in something he might say.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:55.880]   Let's pray.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.840]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.500]   We thank you, Father God, for the power of your word,
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.900]   and as you promised that your word will go forth
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.440]   and will not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.540]   So for that end, we pray that you would anoint this time,
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.680]   that you would protect this pulpit, Father God,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.460]   that only your words and your thoughts will go forth.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.940]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   I think for most Christians, there's a broad category of people
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.780]   that can be split into two.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.300]   Either you are doers or thinkers, right?
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.060]   And so if I was to ask you, which category would you fall into?
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.260]   If you are a doer type, everything that you hear,
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.220]   you're going to be asking, so what practical ramification does this have?
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.520]   How are we going to practice?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.440]   You can talk about theology all you want,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.820]   but what are we actually going to do?
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.040]   And so you tend to kind of gravitate more toward what we're doing,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.440]   and then some of you are thinkers.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.060]   Thinkers are, well, we're going to do all this stuff,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.840]   but what does that mean?
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.260]   And so you love to read books and talk about theology,
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.000]   and so you gravitate toward things where you feel like there's depth.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   We're going in deeper, right?
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.340]   And so either category, whichever category you may be in,
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.300]   you may have a tendency to judge the other side, right?
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.740]   So if somebody gets too deep into theology,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.380]   and it's like, wow, you're talking about all the theology,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.940]   and it'll just make you proud, and, you know,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.080]   What are you actually doing?
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.140]   And then you have the other side where they're going out and doing all this.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.380]   Oh, these guys are so ignorant.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.460]   They don't know the Bible.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.280]   They don't, they didn't read what I read.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.820]   And so that makes you proud.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.420]   And so either side has a tendency to see their strength
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.640]   and then highlight the weakness of the other,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.960]   and so by doing so, nullifying the other.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.320]   Again, the reason why I say this this morning
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.740]   is because oftentimes in the church,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.860]   the church gets divided,
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.000]   and how you learn and how you listen
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   and what stands out to you in the Bible
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.360]   and what you practice
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.780]   may be determined by your disposition.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.740]   You gravitate toward one or the other.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.840]   The early church and the Corinthians church,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.880]   they had the same problem.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.840]   The division in the church did not come
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.280]   because they were embracing sin.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.020]   The problem that the Corinthians church had
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.860]   was they were,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.620]   they couldn't agree on who they should follow.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.720]   Apollos clearly was the better scholar
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.320]   because he understood the Messiah
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.240]   and he was teaching about the Messiah
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.180]   and then Achilla and Priscilla had to come
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.020]   and say, this Messiah that you're teaching,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.080]   Jesus came.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.740]   So he was known as the scholar among the teachers.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.740]   He was maybe more articulate.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.340]   Peter was the doer, right?
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.080]   It's like, he was the one who,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.960]   if Jesus said something,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.380]   he was the first one who reacted.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.120]   He saw Jesus at the lake.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.240]   He said, let me come to you.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.420]   You know, and he just jumped out of the boat.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.840]   He's the kind of guy who measures once and cuts twice.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.200]   He's a doer for sure.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.720]   Apostle Paul was a latecomer, right?
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.380]   And then people were still skeptical of him.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.500]   How can that guy was persecuting and killing people
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.680]   all of a sudden saying that he's representing Christ?
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.020]   And so the division didn't come
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.220]   because they were embracing any particular sin.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.580]   It's just that they couldn't agree
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.000]   on the emphasis of righteousness.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.420]   Where should we put our emphasis?
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.780]   And as a result of that,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.880]   the church went into utter chaos.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.000]   And so the rebuke in the Corinthians church,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.300]   basically Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.140]   what then is Apollos and what is Paul?
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.620]   Servants through whom you believed.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.240]   And even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.180]   I planted a Paul's water,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.300]   but God was causing the growth.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.480]   In other words, you are missing the whole point, right?
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.720]   You're trying to figure out who should we listen to?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.760]   Who has the truth?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.520]   And he said, ultimately,
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.720]   he said, these are just servants of God.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.160]   The emphasis really should be upon Christ.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.100]   You know, we're Baptists,
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.620]   and Baptists have a reputation of being doers, right?
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.540]   And the largest mission organization are the Baptists.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.380]   And so Baptists, again,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.920]   I'm not saying every church is like this,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.460]   but Baptists tend to be,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.120]   if you were to imagine a Baptist is like,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.700]   roll up your sleeve and let's get to work.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.240]   We're going to evangelize and we're going to do this.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.640]   That's what the Baptists are known for.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.460]   And then the Reformed camp is known for the thinking.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.740]   You know, it's like, oh, we read this book.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.620]   And who did you read?
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.100]   What church father do you know?
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.500]   And making sure that we have the correct theology.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.340]   And I think the church oftentimes reflects
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.840]   what we see in the Corinthian church.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.360]   And don't get me wrong,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   theology is very important, right?
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.680]   Because theology basically means a study of God.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.260]   Of course, we are to study God.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.460]   We are to know the depth of what the Bible teaches
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.300]   of who God is.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.700]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.400]   Application is important.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.220]   He says, do not just be hearers of the word,
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.680]   but be doers of the word.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.740]   They're both important.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.060]   But when the division comes
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:46.220]   is when we tend to emphasize one over the other.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.260]   And we miss the whole point
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.860]   of why we're doing what we're doing.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.980]   I say all of this because even in the early church,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.200]   when Christ was preaching,
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.400]   there were two groups of people.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.320]   We had the Pharisees and the lawyers.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.280]   Now, we had other people,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   like had the Sadducees,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.200]   but they were liberals.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.580]   They didn't even believe in the resurrection.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.700]   They didn't believe in any miracles.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.040]   So they weren't even waiting for the Messiah.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.300]   So they're not even in the picture.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.680]   They were leading,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.400]   but they weren't the ones that people were deceiving.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.540]   Nobody would say,
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.980]   if you wanted to know who God is,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.540]   where would you go?
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.000]   Sadducees were not in the picture.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.460]   It was either the Pharisees,
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.940]   the scribes, and the lawyers, right?
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.760]   And the scribes and lawyers
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.140]   are pretty much two different titles
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.900]   of the same group.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.360]   The Pharisees and the lawyers
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.200]   were not necessarily two separate groups.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.400]   The Pharisees was the larger group,
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.800]   and many of the lawyers
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.260]   were part of the Pharisaic group,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.580]   but these two groups are very distinct,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.900]   at least the way it is emphasized
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.900]   in the Gospels.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.440]   Pharisees were the doers,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.260]   and their very name means
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.220]   to be set apart,
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.040]   that we're going to be holy.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.000]   We're going to be set apart.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.360]   We're going to practice everything
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.560]   that the Bible teaches us,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.980]   and so they tend to be more of the doers,
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.040]   and then the lawyers
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.640]   are the ones who were dissecting.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.920]   They were the experts of the law.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.740]   If you had any question
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.120]   about any part of the law,
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.280]   that they were the ones you went to,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.660]   and then they gave you the answers,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.280]   and then usually the Pharisees
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.180]   would apply the things
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.780]   that they're learning,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.040]   but the distinction was
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.420]   the lawyers were the thinkers,
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.380]   and the Pharisees were the doers.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.020]   All of this as an introduction
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.480]   to the rebuke that he's giving
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.500]   to both parties,
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.940]   where he begins by rebuking
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.140]   the Pharisees,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.960]   and then the lawyers hear this
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.860]   and say, wait a second.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.540]   If you say that,
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.780]   it seems like you were kind of
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.400]   mixed in with that.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   You're right.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.780]   You were just as guilty as them,
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.960]   and then he breaks into it.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.240]   So if you notice carefully
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.220]   the six woes that are given
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.060]   in this text,
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.020]   the three of them
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.400]   were given to the doers,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.200]   and then the other three
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.480]   are given to the thinkers.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.420]   There's a danger on both sides
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.060]   if you missed the whole point.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.440]   Even in this group,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.200]   I bet there are some people
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.400]   who if I get into deep theology,
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.420]   it's like, oh, yes,
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.820]   thank you for giving us that
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.260]   because I hear it all the time.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.800]   Or if I say something
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.920]   and then there wasn't enough
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.180]   emphasis on application,
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:08.740]   it's like, oh,
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.580]   what is all that for, right?
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.920]   If we're not careful,
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.440]   we can fall into the danger
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.760]   and the pitfalls on both sides.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.260]   So I want to go over the three,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.600]   and I got through one last week,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.900]   so I'm going to have to speed it up, okay?
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   So I'm going to go through
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.280]   all of it today, right?
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.600]   Yeah, I did one last week.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.040]   I'm going to do all six today, okay?
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.620]   The first woes.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.040]   The first woes,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.860]   and I want to compare the first woe
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.600]   to the Pharisees
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.220]   and the first woe
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.680]   to the Sadducees
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.000]   because I think they correlate,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.020]   or not Sadducees,
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.560]   the lawyers.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.360]   The first woes
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.320]   were an indictment
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.220]   against how they handled the law,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.680]   how they handled the law.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.000]   To the Pharisees,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.400]   he says,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.160]   you emphasize what is less,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.120]   and then you completely ignore
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.200]   the weightier laws.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.140]   In verse 42,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.600]   you tithe mint and rue
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.060]   and all kinds of garden herbs,
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.380]   but when it comes
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.200]   to weightier laws
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.020]   like justice
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.920]   and love of God,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.360]   you completely ignored it.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.160]   In other words,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.540]   it was selective obedience.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.000]   And that is a tendency
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.340]   sometimes of the doers,
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.740]   that whatever it is
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.780]   that you're good at,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.480]   you tend to highlight that
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.820]   and put that up on the pedestal
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.820]   for people to see,
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.100]   but the things
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.920]   that you're not good at
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.320]   are kind of like,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.000]   oh, no one's perfect,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.120]   and we kind of brush it
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.760]   under the rug.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.140]   So if you happen to be
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.720]   maybe good at evangelizing,
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.900]   you know,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.220]   it's like,
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.080]   oh, I evangelize,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.500]   how come you're not evangelizing?
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.880]   Maybe you're generous.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.040]   I give,
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.100]   but how come you don't give?
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:39.700]   I serve,
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.800]   how come you don't serve?
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.380]   And so the Pharisees
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.280]   were rebuked,
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.480]   and you highlight
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.180]   the things you're good at,
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.260]   but the weightier stuff,
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.640]   the things that are more important,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.120]   not that the other's not important,
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.920]   he said you should have done
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.860]   one without neglecting the other,
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.680]   but why do you emphasize
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.780]   and brag about
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.740]   paying
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.100]   tide of every little thing,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.320]   every other herb garden,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.240]   but when it comes to
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.760]   real heavy stuff
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.740]   about loving God
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.760]   and righteousness,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.100]   that you tend to sweep
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.940]   that under the rug.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.600]   You should have done
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.980]   one without the other.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.100]   Again,
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.860]   that's a tendency
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.800]   for all of us
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.120]   because
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.980]   when we are examined
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.080]   inside and out,
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.140]   we all have things
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.180]   that we fall short of,
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.000]   but when we
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.140]   are active
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.040]   and when we're obedient
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.780]   in certain things,
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.460]   we have a tendency,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.940]   for whatever the reason,
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.280]   whatever obedience
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.960]   that we happen
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.760]   to be good at,
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.480]   if we're not careful
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.620]   and pride steps in,
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.560]   it turns into
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.280]   an indictment
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.100]   against anybody else
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:38.860]   who's not doing
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.480]   what we're doing.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.380]   I don't know how many times
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.360]   I've seen this.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.260]   People get into,
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.480]   like,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:43.900]   we're going to do
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.660]   homeless ministry,
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.920]   and then they get into
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.700]   homeless ministry,
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.380]   and they want to
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.340]   bring a charge
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.600]   and say,
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:48.760]   hey,
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.640]   why don't we do this,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.460]   and we should do this,
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.660]   and they rally people,
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.640]   and then they get discouraged
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.240]   because people
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:53.960]   are not coming out
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.720]   and helping them out,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.940]   and then their excitement
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.820]   to serve the homeless
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.040]   becomes an indictment
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.640]   against anybody
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.320]   who's not doing
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:34:59.760]   the homeless,
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   and then eventually
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.620]   they give up.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.920]   I see the same thing
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.600]   with prayer.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   I see the same thing
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.500]   with Bible study.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.520]   I see the same thing
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.480]   with missions,
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.560]   evangelism,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.180]   that anything
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.980]   that happens,
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.100]   if we're not careful,
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.900]   it turns into,
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.260]   instead of celebrating God,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.580]   an indictment
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.300]   against somebody else
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.280]   who's not doing that.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   And he says,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.920]   woe to you Pharisees,
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.220]   because you have
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:22.600]   a tendency
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.380]   to highlight
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.140]   your righteousness
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.700]   and the things
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.340]   that are weighty,
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.020]   you kind of sweep
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.640]   under the rug.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.940]   And then to the lawyers,
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.560]   the thinkers,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.000]   he says in verse 46,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.920]   woe to you lawyers
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.400]   as well,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.380]   for you weigh men
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.480]   down with burdens
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.520]   hard to bear,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.140]   while you yourselves
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.160]   will not even touch
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.660]   the burdens
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.180]   with one of your fingers.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.200]   I want to take
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.180]   a quick look
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.460]   at just a few
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.160]   of these burdens
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.520]   that these lawyers
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.300]   laid on people.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.880]   There were 39
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.060]   different categories
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.700]   of laws
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.200]   that they've
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.960]   divided into.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.000]   And out of 39
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.260]   different categories,
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.180]   there are a total
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.460]   of 1,500 rules
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.160]   that they added
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.400]   to the scripture.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   So whenever
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.580]   they indicted Jesus
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:03.820]   and said,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.500]   how come you're not
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.200]   obeying the law?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.480]   Jesus never disobeyed
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:06.820]   the law.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.720]   Remember,
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.540]   he lived a perfect
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.340]   sinless life.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.500]   What they were
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.560]   accusing him of
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.520]   is breaking
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.320]   their tradition.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.880]   What did it mean
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.760]   to obey the Sabbath?
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.440]   What did it mean
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:17.700]   to them?
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.420]   So they took
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.320]   a teaching
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.920]   of the Bible
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.020]   and then they
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.100]   made the application
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:22.720]   the Bible.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.500]   And they didn't
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.400]   distinguish between
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.700]   the two.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.020]   So the 1,500 rules
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.820]   that they made
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.220]   to them was equivalent
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.300]   to the Bible itself.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.520]   Let me give you
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.080]   some of it.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.900]   A needle could not
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.800]   be viewed as a tool
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.220]   for labor.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.080]   A needle was viewed
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.540]   as a tool for labor.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.540]   So if you had a needle
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.280]   on the Sabbath,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.240]   you were working.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.360]   So that's the
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.880]   breaking of the
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.080]   Sabbath.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.200]   The Sabbath day
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.840]   journey was
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.780]   2,000 cubits.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.260]   So you're not
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:49.820]   allowed to go
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.520]   beyond the
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.080]   Sabbath day's
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:51.640]   journey or else
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.220]   you break it.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.040]   It was equivalent
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.580]   to about 0.6 miles.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.600]   But because it
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.200]   was too hard
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.300]   to keep 0.6 miles
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:00.740]   if you have to
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.440]   go visit your
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.240]   sister or maybe
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.900]   your wife
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.620]   went into labor
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.120]   and they couldn't
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.720]   break the Sabbath
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.280]   so on 0.6 miles
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   they would place
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.160]   an item of their
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   house at the
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.880]   0.6 miles
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.540]   and that would
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.420]   extend your
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.160]   boundary.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.880]   So at 0.6
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.260]   you would put
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.060]   something so now
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:17.920]   that's your home
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.640]   and then at
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.380]   another 0.6
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:19.900]   you would place
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.300]   something and
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:20.980]   now that's your
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.740]   home so they
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.340]   would keep
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.080]   putting something
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   at 0.6 miles
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:24.500]   so that they
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:24.960]   couldn't break
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.380]   the Sabbath.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.840]   This is how
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.540]   ridiculous their
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.140]   laws were.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.920]   Carrying any
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.840]   object from a
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.700]   private domain
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.340]   to a public
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:32.960]   domain, any
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.900]   object, carrying
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.520]   a mat and
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.320]   handkerchief or
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.140]   even a fig,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.280]   whatever it was,
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.920]   if you carried
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.860]   it from private
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.680]   to public, it
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.140]   was breaking
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.620]   the Sabbath.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.380]   I mean I'm
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.100]   just giving you
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.580]   three of the
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.040]   1,500 different
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.500]   laws that they
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.280]   said if you
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.140]   don't obey this
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.080]   you're not a
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.800]   serious believer.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.640]   You have to do
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:54.960]   this.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.400]   And so the
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.100]   Pharisees tried
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.640]   to keep it
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.440]   meticulously and
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:37:59.740]   they judged
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.780]   everybody based
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.340]   upon these
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.540]   things.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:01.960]   And then the
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.380]   lawyers were
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.760]   the ones who
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.100]   were sitting
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.800]   and calculating
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.980]   what does it
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.660]   mean to obey?
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.040]   What does it
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.400]   mean to keep
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.800]   the Sabbath
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.100]   holy?
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.480]   What does it
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.020]   mean not to
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:08.300]   work?
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.040]   And they kept
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.860]   on adding over
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.220]   and over
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:11.580]   and again.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.380]   So people
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:12.820]   had to live
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.320]   under this.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.920]   If they wanted
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.620]   to be
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.420]   participants in
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:15.860]   the synagogue,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.840]   if they want
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.220]   to come to
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:17.640]   the temple,
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.060]   if they want
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.500]   to move up
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.040]   the religious
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.240]   rank, the
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.700]   people who
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.100]   did this
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.000]   better would
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.540]   be coming up
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:23.860]   the rank.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.460]   And that's
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:24.860]   what he was
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.720]   accusing them
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:25.860]   of.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.880]   He said it
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.500]   wasn't simply
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.060]   that they made
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:28.640]   up all these
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:28.860]   rules.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.340]   He says,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.460]   while you
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.580]   yourself will
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.280]   not even touch
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.760]   the burdens
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.400]   with one of
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.220]   your fingers.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.340]   In other words,
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.800]   you're not there
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.880]   to represent
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.360]   God and
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:39.840]   help people.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.140]   You could
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:40.940]   care less
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.040]   about people.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.300]   He said,
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:43.880]   if you're a
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.340]   leader, I
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.100]   presented it
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:45.460]   to you so
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:45.800]   that you
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.260]   can help
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:46.660]   them come
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.120]   to me.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.660]   Instead,
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:48.900]   he said,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.260]   well, this is
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:49.500]   what the
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.080]   Bible says,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.320]   and this is
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:50.560]   what the
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.240]   Bible says.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   And it
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.500]   ended up
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.020]   becoming more
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:54.540]   of a burden.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.880]   Remember what
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.140]   Jesus says to
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:57.840]   the Pharisees
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.340]   who accused
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.560]   him?
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.480]   How come
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:38:59.700]   you don't
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.020]   keep the
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.460]   traditions?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.120]   How come
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.380]   you don't
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.720]   do this?
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.040]   How come
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.420]   you're carrying
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.820]   a pen?
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.560]   Why are you
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:03.880]   walking?
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.780]   Why are you
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.100]   healing?
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.220]   Remember what
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.760]   Jesus said?
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.540]   you missed
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:08.780]   the whole
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.060]   point of
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.440]   the Sabbath.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:09.960]   The Sabbath
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.440]   was made
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:10.920]   for man,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.380]   not man
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.880]   for Sabbath.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.060]   Sabbath
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:14.780]   was not
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.000]   a way
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.420]   for you
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.080]   to become
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.720]   righteous.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.320]   The Sabbath
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:19.820]   was given
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.420]   as a purpose
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.220]   of rest,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.040]   to connect
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.700]   with God.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.060]   But you
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.580]   made it a
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:26.880]   burden.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.100]   You made
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:28.900]   all the laws
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.300]   of God
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:29.740]   to be a
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:29.980]   burden.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.680]   He said,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.020]   Christ is
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.560]   the Lord
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:34.980]   of the
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.220]   Sabbath.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.880]   So first
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.360]   and foremost,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:37.840]   even in
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.100]   the way
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.400]   that they
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.040]   approached
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.880]   the Bible,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.860]   it was a
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.520]   way they
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.940]   thought that
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.300]   they were
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:44.620]   going to
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.120]   be righteous.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.160]   And he
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:46.280]   said,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.600]   you missed
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:46.860]   the whole
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.260]   point.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.620]   The second
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.120]   woes that
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.440]   are given
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.740]   as an
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.280]   indictment
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.780]   against the
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.080]   way that
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.440]   they use
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:52.720]   the law
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.400]   for themselves.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.680]   For the
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.300]   Pharisees,
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.120]   they displayed
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:57.760]   their righteousness
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.340]   for others
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.620]   to see.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.100]   Luke 11,
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.760]   43 says,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.360]   woe to you
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:00.780]   Pharisees,
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.100]   for you
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.080]   love the
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.760]   chief seats
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.000]   in the
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.300]   synagogue
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:03.960]   and
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.100]   their
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.700]   respectful
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.220]   greetings
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.720]   in the
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.340]   marketplaces.
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.680]   The chief
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.980]   seats in
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.100]   the
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.660]   synagogues
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.260]   were the
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:10.660]   seats that
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.220]   were reserved
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:11.680]   for the
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.600]   leaders and
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.020]   that faced
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.360]   the other
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:13.620]   way.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:13.960]   I don't
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.040]   know,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.440]   some of
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:14.900]   you may
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.220]   have come
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.080]   from churches
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.680]   and again,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.020]   I'm not
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.520]   saying that
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.840]   that is all
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   wrong,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.700]   but some
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.080]   of you may
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:21.360]   have come
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:21.800]   from churches
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.180]   where you
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.120]   have the
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.620]   pulpit on
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.540]   either side
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:24.980]   and then in
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.240]   the middle
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.600]   there's an
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.060]   altar and
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:26.400]   there's a
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.700]   bunch of
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.040]   seats in
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.420]   the back.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.680]   And so I've
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:28.920]   been at
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.380]   churches where
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:29.780]   if I'm a
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.340]   guest speaker
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.740]   or I'm
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.140]   praying for
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:31.700]   something that
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.000]   we would
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.380]   sit up in
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.560]   the front and
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.320]   typically would
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:34.680]   look outside.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:34.980]   And again,
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.640]   this is not
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.700]   an indictment
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.460]   against the
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:37.800]   form.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.300]   The problem
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.360]   with the
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:40.820]   Pharisees,
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.160]   he says,
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.900]   your whole
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.920]   point of why
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.360]   you're doing
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:43.680]   what you're
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.360]   doing is to
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:44.960]   be seen.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.760]   They love to
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.320]   sit in the
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:47.700]   seat of
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.000]   Moses and
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.520]   to receive
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:49.900]   the honor.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.680]   Your whole
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.400]   purpose of
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.260]   obeying the
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.240]   law wasn't
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.320]   necessarily a
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.140]   godly desire
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.980]   to know God
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.140]   or to
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.620]   bring people
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.120]   to God.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.160]   It's so that
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.780]   you can have
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.460]   a seat of
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:01.860]   honor.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.060]   In Matthew
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.020]   23, 5,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.760]   Jesus says to
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:05.940]   them,
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.900]   everything that
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.620]   they do is
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.360]   for men to
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:08.620]   see.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.820]   Everything that
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.200]   they do.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.860]   He said,
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.440]   even the way
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.400]   they prayed in
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.360]   Matthew 6, 5,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.220]   they pray in
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.680]   the synagogue,
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.520]   on the street,
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.120]   on the corner,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.680]   so that they
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.520]   may be seen.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.380]   So he tells
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.360]   them, when you
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:21.840]   pray, don't
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.580]   pray like these
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.140]   Pharisees.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.880]   He's not saying
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.460]   you can't pray
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:26.900]   in public.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.760]   He's not saying
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.080]   that you
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:28.600]   shouldn't gather
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.280]   together to
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.540]   pray.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.420]   He was
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.680]   indicting the
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.420]   Pharisees.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.340]   He said,
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.200]   everything that
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.680]   they do is
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.220]   for other
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:35.720]   people to
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:35.900]   see.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.040]   So they
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.620]   basically were
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.300]   presenting their
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.740]   righteousness.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.000]   So they, on
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.460]   the things that
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.020]   people don't
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.140]   see, they're
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:44.740]   unrighteous.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.000]   But when the
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.720]   people are able
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.340]   to examine,
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.040]   all of a sudden
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.420]   they're the
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.080]   holiest people.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.680]   They said, don't
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.200]   be like the
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.780]   Pharisees.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.280]   Now we may
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:54.800]   look at them
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.600]   and say, you
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:55.940]   know, thank
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.340]   God, we're
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.260]   not Pharisees.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.160]   But there's a
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.880]   tendency in all
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.340]   of us to
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.140]   emphasize on
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:01.760]   the things that
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.280]   we can be
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.140]   measured by and
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.580]   the things that
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.100]   they don't
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.540]   know, you
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:05.720]   know, we
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:05.980]   don't pay
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.460]   much attention
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:06.740]   to.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.060]   The things
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:08.520]   that are
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.280]   urgent because
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.800]   people will
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.420]   judge us if
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.020]   we don't.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.680]   He said, that
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.420]   was the problem
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:14.700]   with the
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.080]   Pharisee.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.500]   In fact, in
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.640]   Luke 20, 46,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.360]   it says, beware
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.520]   of the scribes
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.820]   who like to
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.160]   walk around in
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.900]   long robes,
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.180]   love respectful
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.740]   greetings in the
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.340]   marketplace and
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.000]   chief seats in
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.520]   the synagogues
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.220]   and places of
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.320]   honor at
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.960]   banquets.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.560]   Think how
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.440]   paradigm shifting
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.140]   this is because
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.620]   if you asked
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.820]   anybody at that
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.720]   time, who's the
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.360]   spiritual leader?
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.240]   Who knows the
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:38.860]   law better than
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.080]   anybody?
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:39.520]   It would have
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:39.860]   been these
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.160]   people.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.860]   But when Jesus
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.680]   says, beware of
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.800]   them, I mean,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.020]   this is far cry
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.320]   from follow them,
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.020]   listen to them.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.680]   He says, no,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.500]   beware of
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:51.700]   them.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.120]   In other
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.080]   words, they're
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.560]   going to ruin
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.400]   you if you
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.920]   listen to them.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.320]   They're going to
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.240]   ruin you if you
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.760]   follow them.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.440]   Beware of them
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.180]   because everything
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.860]   that they do.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.820]   So if you
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:02.560]   follow them, you're
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.240]   going to be just
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:03.780]   as much of a
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.720]   hypocrite as they
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.040]   are.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   You're going to
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.720]   be just as much
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.460]   of a showman as
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:07.820]   they are.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.120]   You're going to
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:08.920]   be just as proud
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.060]   as they are if
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:10.700]   you continue to
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.200]   follow them.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.980]   So this is an
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:12.960]   indictment against
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.000]   the Pharisees,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.120]   working so hard to
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.760]   be holy, all for
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.860]   the purpose of
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.600]   presenting their
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.360]   righteousness in
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:20.820]   front of other
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.180]   people.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.460]   There's a reason
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.040]   why the Bible
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.960]   says, do not
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.820]   lay hands hastily.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.220]   Some sins are
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.020]   obvious, some
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.100]   sins trail behind
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:28.480]   them.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.080]   And the sins
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:30.940]   that trail behind
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.400]   them, you will
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.260]   see later, so you
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:32.840]   need to take your
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.220]   time and not to
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.340]   establish hastily.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.500]   So he says to
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.960]   the Pharisees, be
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.000]   wary, woe to
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.300]   you.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.000]   Everything that you
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.220]   do was to
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:43.840]   present your
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.880]   righteousness rather
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.440]   than being
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:45.960]   righteous.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   To the lawyers,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.600]   for the purpose
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.720]   of time, I'm
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:51.980]   not going to
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.540]   read the whole
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.060]   thing, but this
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.920]   was an indictment
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.540]   against these
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.040]   lawyers who
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.500]   said, you know
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.460]   what, we come
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.320]   from the line of
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320]   prophets in the
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   Old Testament.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.840]   And so as
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.100]   these men who
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.180]   were great men
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:05.820]   of God, who
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.820]   represented God
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.440]   and preached
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.220]   and did what
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:10.740]   God told them
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.820]   to do, they
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.740]   venerated them,
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.600]   they celebrated
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:13.940]   them.
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.140]   But Jesus says
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.980]   to them, you're
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.720]   not from the
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.480]   line of the
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:18.900]   prophets.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.940]   The line that
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.720]   you come from
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.100]   are your
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.740]   ancestors, are
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.140]   the ones who
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.100]   ended up killing
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:24.420]   them.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.980]   The spirit that
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.920]   is in you is
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.540]   not from the
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.280]   prophets as you
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:29.820]   celebrate and
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.320]   think, look,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.220]   we're like that
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.300]   we received our
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.620]   assignment from
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.260]   the line of the
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:34.660]   prophets.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.040]   No.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.940]   I mean, this is
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.900]   exactly the opposite
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.540]   of what they were
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.040]   presenting, what
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:40.700]   they thought that
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.060]   they were.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.600]   He says, no,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.560]   you're like your
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.720]   ancestors who
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.420]   ended up killing
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.680]   them, just like
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.220]   they did to
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.200]   Abel and to
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:49.600]   the other
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.180]   prophets.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.680]   I mean, think
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.320]   about that, how
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.960]   offensive that is.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.360]   When you hear
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.860]   something like
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.920]   that, either
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.060]   you say, if
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.100]   that's true, if
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.200]   Jesus is telling
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.660]   the truth, that
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.360]   means everything
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.060]   that I thought
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.880]   about myself,
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.500]   everything that
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.000]   I've been teaching
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.480]   about other
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:05.980]   people was
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.860]   completely wrong.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.680]   I wasn't just
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.220]   off.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.320]   I wasn't just
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:10.840]   off.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.260]   I'm actually
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.100]   hindering people
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.760]   from coming to
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.080]   God.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.300]   So either
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.080]   God put them
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:17.540]   in a place
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.080]   where either
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.980]   you repent
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.180]   or you need
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:20.540]   to get rid
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:20.780]   of Him.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.420]   You see why
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.100]   they felt the
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.480]   need to get
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:24.920]   rid of Him?
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.460]   Because they
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:25.880]   were unwilling
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.400]   to repent.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.760]   What Jesus
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.260]   was saying
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.020]   was so
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:29.780]   radically
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.360]   different.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.320]   Either they
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:32.640]   had to
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.000]   abandon
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.640]   everything that
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:33.940]   they were
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.980]   thinking and
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.440]   come to
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.180]   repentance like
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.100]   everybody else,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.900]   or this guy
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.340]   has to go
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:39.820]   because the
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.500]   more notoriety
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:41.940]   He gets,
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.300]   the more
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:42.700]   He begins
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.220]   to talk,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.180]   nor more
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.380]   He makes
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:45.760]   us look
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.120]   bad.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:46.560]   He doesn't
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.040]   simply say
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:47.500]   you're one
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:47.820]   of many
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.040]   sinners.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.260]   No,
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:48.700]   you are
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.380]   chief of
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:49.700]   the sinners.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.260]   You're the
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.120]   reasons why
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.140]   Israel is
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.600]   in the state
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.340]   that it is.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.980]   The third
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.700]   woe is an
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.300]   indictment
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.920]   against them
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.980]   in what they
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.420]   thought that
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:03.680]   they were
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.180]   producing.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.740]   To the
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.520]   Pharisees,
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.400]   they were
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.280]   obsessed with
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.140]   being clean.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.200]   They were
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.900]   obsessed with
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.260]   being clean.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:12.760]   So they
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.160]   were trying
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.420]   to show
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:13.780]   a pattern.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.280]   If you
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.460]   want to
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:14.860]   be clean,
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.420]   don't touch
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:15.620]   this,
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.040]   don't go
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.220]   there,
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.700]   don't eat
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.120]   this.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.100]   On the
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.340]   Sabbath,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:18.640]   you have
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:18.860]   to do
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.260]   this and
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:19.640]   not do
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:19.900]   this.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:20.140]   And so
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:20.580]   they wanted
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:20.860]   to be
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.460]   pure before
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:21.800]   the eyes
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.240]   of God.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.440]   But Jesus
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:23.840]   says to
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.000]   them,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:24.460]   woe to
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:24.760]   you,
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.200]   for you
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.580]   are like
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.080]   concealed
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.560]   tombs,
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:26.820]   and the
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.220]   people who
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:27.780]   walk over
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.220]   them are
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.100]   unaware of
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.340]   it.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.120]   If there's
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.280]   anything that
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.220]   the first
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:33.940]   century Jews
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.620]   were obsessed
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.000]   with,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.740]   is being
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.200]   clean.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.080]   they had
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:39.300]   to be
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.640]   clean.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.000]   So that's
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.300]   why they
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:40.560]   couldn't
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:40.900]   enter
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.780]   a Gentile's
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.600]   home.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.460]   They
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:43.780]   wouldn't
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.080]   even step
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.580]   foot.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.420]   Or where the
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.120]   Samaritans lived,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:48.520]   because they
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.040]   were afraid of
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:49.980]   becoming unclean.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.360]   They wouldn't
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:50.800]   walk on the
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.260]   same side of
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:51.720]   the street.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.940]   They wouldn't
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:53.440]   eat the same
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:53.680]   food.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.060]   They wouldn't
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.380]   use the
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:54.900]   same plate,
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.320]   because they
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:55.920]   were obsessed
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   with being
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:56.780]   clean.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.440]   And the
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:57.820]   people who
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:57.920]   were on
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.460]   the top
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:58.740]   of this
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.200]   totem pole
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.520]   were the
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.260]   Pharisees.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.700]   If we
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.200]   follow them,
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:02.500]   if we
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:02.960]   became their
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.440]   disciples,
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.640]   we will be
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:04.920]   clean.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.280]   Instead,
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:05.900]   Jesus says,
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:06.460]   not only are
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.120]   you unclean,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.800]   he uses the
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.600]   illustration of
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.160]   a grave,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.020]   which for
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:11.340]   a first
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:11.920]   century Jew,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.560]   there's nothing
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   more unclean
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.380]   than a
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:14.640]   grave.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.400]   And that's
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.040]   why in the
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:17.640]   first century,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.420]   every tomb
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.220]   was marked,
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.200]   so that people
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.720]   would know,
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   even before you
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.580]   would enter into
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.660]   a grave site,
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.160]   there would be
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:25.600]   warnings.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.680]   you can't
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:27.980]   go there,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.300]   because as
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:28.680]   soon as you
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.100]   step there,
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.540]   you become
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.000]   unclean.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.040]   So if you,
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.460]   even by accident,
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.540]   encounter a
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.100]   grave, you
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:34.620]   would be
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.540]   unclean for
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.300]   a minimum of
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:36.940]   seven days.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.440]   And if you
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:38.980]   were unclean
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.640]   for seven days,
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.140]   it means that
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.440]   you couldn't
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:40.760]   fellowship,
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.200]   you couldn't
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.820]   go back home,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.020]   you couldn't
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:43.500]   go worship,
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.280]   you couldn't
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.020]   give sacrifices
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:45.640]   for seven
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.800]   days that
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.140]   you are
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.700]   isolated.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.000]   And he
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.320]   says,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.040]   not only
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.340]   are you
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:53.920]   unclean,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.840]   everybody who
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.820]   encounters you
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:57.900]   is going to
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.880]   become unclean.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.320]   Exact opposite
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.180]   of what they
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.900]   thought they
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.560]   were doing.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.000]   In Matthew
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.740]   23, 15,
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.200]   woe to you
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:06.620]   scribes and
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:06.940]   Pharisees,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.360]   hypocrites,
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.780]   because you
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.600]   travel around
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.740]   on sea and
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.440]   land to make
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.260]   one proselyte,
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:11.980]   and when he
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.660]   becomes one,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.460]   you make him
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.280]   twice as much
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.820]   of a son of
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.740]   hell as
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.300]   yourself.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.940]   You work so
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.560]   hard to make
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.020]   disciples,
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.380]   but the
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.000]   disciples that
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.280]   you are
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:21.680]   making,
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.380]   are making
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.440]   them unclean
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.440]   and they're
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:25.940]   actually doing
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.480]   much more
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.020]   damage.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.200]   Now,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.660]   let me look
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.040]   at that and
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:30.140]   say,
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:30.680]   thank God
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.060]   we're not
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:31.660]   Pharisees.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   Thank God
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.060]   that's not
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.480]   us.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.980]   Because
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.860]   2,000 years
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.460]   removed,
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.620]   2,000 years
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:40.880]   removed,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.540]   we can easily
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.000]   look with
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.840]   clarity and
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.140]   say,
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:43.520]   well,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.100]   here's where
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:44.520]   they went
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:44.860]   wrong,
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.480]   here's what
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.640]   they misinterpreted,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   here's how
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.420]   they misapplied,
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.080]   they didn't get
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.280]   it,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.140]   thank God
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.740]   that's not
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:51.140]   us.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.320]   Is that
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.560]   true?
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   I think
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:55.820]   all the
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.560]   people that
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:56.920]   are in the
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.420]   greatest danger
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.000]   obviously is
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.320]   me,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.300]   because this
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:48:59.620]   is talking
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.020]   about the
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:00.300]   leaders.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.680]   This is
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.080]   talking about
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.520]   leadership,
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.300]   and there's
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.200]   a reason why
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.580]   the Bible
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.680]   warns us
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   about not
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.020]   being hasty
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:09.700]   in establishing
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.260]   leaders.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.840]   They will
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.280]   come under
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:12.740]   a stricter
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.040]   judgment,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:13.960]   because when
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.360]   a leader
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.020]   fails,
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.660]   it affects
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.220]   a lot more
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.560]   people.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.100]   There is a
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:19.480]   constant
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.060]   temptation
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:20.620]   when you're
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:20.740]   in
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.100]   leadership,
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.320]   to present
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:22.920]   yourself as
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.400]   righteous when
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.720]   you're not
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.180]   righteous,
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.440]   to present
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.020]   yourself as
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:26.380]   clean,
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.780]   knowing very
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.100]   well that
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:28.420]   you're not
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:28.720]   clean.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.960]   There's all
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.280]   kinds of
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:30.820]   compromises
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.340]   happening,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.520]   but then you
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.180]   teach anyway,
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:33.860]   but you lead
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.320]   anyway,
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.020]   but you present
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:35.520]   anyway.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.240]   The warning
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.040]   is against
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.840]   the leadership
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.460]   and the
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.100]   Pharisees,
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:40.800]   who are
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.140]   selling
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:41.660]   themselves,
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:42.180]   presenting
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.300]   themselves as
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:43.620]   the one,
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.280]   if you follow
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:44.760]   me, I will
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.200]   bring you to
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:45.560]   Christ,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.300]   but he says,
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.280]   not only are
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:48.780]   you not bringing
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.400]   them to me,
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.440]   they become
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.680]   twice as much
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.220]   of a son of
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:53.960]   hell as
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.360]   you are.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.780]   To the
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.560]   lawyers, he
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.280]   says in
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.160]   verse 52,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:58.780]   woe to you
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.200]   lawyers, for
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:49:59.480]   you have
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:49:59.960]   taken away
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.400]   the key of
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:00.760]   knowledge.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.600]   You yourself
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.020]   did not
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.560]   enter, and
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.060]   you hindered
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.760]   those who
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.300]   were entering.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.200]   So that's
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:06.540]   what they were
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.060]   known for,
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.700]   knowledge.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.160]   Right?
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:09.560]   These were
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.100]   the thinkers,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.380]   and they were
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:11.880]   giving them
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.380]   knowledge.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380]   They were
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:13.800]   interpreting
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.040]   law.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.440]   If they wanted
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.020]   to know what
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:15.380]   the Bible
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:15.820]   said,
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.760]   they were
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.100]   the ones
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:17.440]   who were
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.100]   disseminating
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:18.980]   knowledge about
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.160]   God, and
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.900]   Jesus says,
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.500]   no, not only
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:21.900]   are you not
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.340]   giving away
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:22.840]   knowledge, you
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.400]   shut the
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:23.880]   door to
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.340]   knowledge, and
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.020]   you yourself
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.460]   will not
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:26.880]   enter.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.200]   All the
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.700]   teachings that
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.200]   you're teaching
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.040]   them about
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:30.780]   what it means
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.480]   to enter into
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:31.880]   the kingdom,
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.520]   not only are
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:32.880]   you not
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.840]   entering, that
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.580]   because of
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.160]   you, they
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:36.540]   will be
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.220]   hindered from
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:37.560]   entering.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.040]   In other
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.620]   words, you
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.320]   miss the
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.020]   whole point.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.560]   I think about
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.200]   that indictment,
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:43.880]   and both of
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.900]   them, one was
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.540]   obsessed with
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.340]   being clean, and
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.680]   he says,
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.140]   not only
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.520]   are you
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.220]   unclean,
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.400]   everybody's
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:50.540]   going to
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.480]   become unclean
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:51.920]   because of
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.080]   you.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.360]   The lawyers
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:53.780]   were known
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:54.820]   to disseminate
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.420]   knowledge, and
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.140]   not only do
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.740]   you not have
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.460]   knowledge, you
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.100]   preventing
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.440]   knowledge, the
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.120]   very thing that
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:00.880]   you were bragging
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.580]   about, you're
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.260]   doing exactly
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.160]   the opposite.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.920]   Now, we can
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.200]   easily dismiss
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.740]   this and say,
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.300]   well, thank
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.820]   God, you
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.060]   know, the
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:09.720]   lawyers, and
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.220]   clearly they
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:10.540]   made the
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.080]   mistake, and
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.640]   the Pharisees,
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.100]   clearly they
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.400]   made the
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:12.680]   mistake.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:13.500]   I think
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:13.980]   the danger
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.120]   is in, even
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.940]   today, that
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:19.400]   we have one
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:19.680]   or the
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.080]   other, say,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:20.440]   oh, we're
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.040]   the doers, and
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:21.300]   we're going to
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:21.900]   do this, and
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.580]   then anybody
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.140]   who gets
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:23.620]   into too
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.120]   deep into
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.260]   theology, you
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:25.620]   know, those
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.080]   people, those
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.760]   Pharisees, or
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   you're on the
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.320]   other side, we
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.720]   know this, who
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.160]   are the church
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:32.660]   fathers, what's
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:32.960]   the latest
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.460]   book that you
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.380]   read, but in
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.160]   application, you
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.480]   are nowhere
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.520]   near, and so
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.260]   what's put on
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.880]   the pedestal,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.540]   the things that
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.220]   we're good at,
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:42.700]   and then we
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:42.960]   kind of
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.560]   minimize the
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:43.860]   things that
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.200]   we're not
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.640]   good at.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.720]   In 1 Timothy
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.300]   1.80, it
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.060]   says, the
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.360]   problem was
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:49.720]   not the
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:49.980]   law.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.680]   The problem
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.160]   was not the
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.400]   law.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.620]   He said, we
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.200]   know that the
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:54.780]   law is good
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.580]   if one uses
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.520]   it lawfully.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.900]   One uses it
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.460]   lawfully.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.440]   The law
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.060]   itself was not
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:01.440]   the problem.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:01.900]   It's what
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.600]   they did with
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.140]   the law that
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.540]   caused the
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:03.920]   problem.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.520]   So, natural
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.660]   question is,
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.160]   then what is
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.240]   the useful, what
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.020]   is the legal,
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.980]   right?
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.560]   What is the
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.160]   right use of
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:11.460]   the law?
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.100]   In John
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.000]   chapter 5, 39
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.500]   to 40, he
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:13.720]   says, you
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.160]   search the
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.700]   scriptures because
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.260]   you think that
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.040]   in them you
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.660]   have eternal
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:16.940]   life.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.480]   It is these
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.040]   that testify
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.740]   about me.
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.800]   That if you
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.700]   think that
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.240]   life comes
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:21.760]   because you
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.420]   found the
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:22.800]   text, and
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.940]   if you apply
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.780]   it this way,
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.640]   and if you
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:25.980]   apply it
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.560]   specifically in
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:26.960]   this way,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.260]   that you're
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:27.640]   going to find
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:27.920]   life.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.460]   And he
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.360]   says, all
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.240]   of this was
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.220]   about me,
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.700]   and you are
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.400]   unwilling to
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   come to me
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.360]   so that you
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.120]   may have
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.700]   life.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.420]   everything that
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.280]   he gave was
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:40.820]   to bring
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.300]   us to
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:41.880]   Christ.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.260]   That's why
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:43.760]   when Jesus,
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.300]   before he went
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:44.860]   to the cross,
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.320]   he asked the
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   disciples, who
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.280]   do you say
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.120]   that I am?
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.160]   That was the
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.960]   test, to see if
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.480]   they're prepared.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.420]   Who do you say
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.100]   that I am?
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.180]   I know what
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.420]   they say, but
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:58.180]   who do you say?
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:58.900]   Because the whole
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.680]   purpose of his
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.980]   ministry was to
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.000]   open their eyes
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.720]   about him.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.240]   He didn't say,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.180]   are you ready to
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:05.800]   make disciples?
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.080]   Do you know
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:07.660]   how to train
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:07.840]   them?
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.120]   Do you know
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:08.600]   what to do
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.300]   if they drag
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:09.800]   you into
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   courts?
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.600]   If anything,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.180]   Jesus says,
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:12.620]   don't worry
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:13.080]   about that.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:13.400]   The Holy
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:13.840]   Spirit's going
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.100]   to give you
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:14.500]   words to
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:14.800]   speak.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.820]   But the
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.240]   only thing
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:16.520]   that he
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.900]   said was,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:17.440]   do you
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:17.780]   know who
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.220]   I am?
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.320]   I've been
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:20.840]   walking with
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.120]   you for
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.800]   three years,
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.740]   but do you
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.060]   know who
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:23.340]   I am?
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:23.780]   And then
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.300]   they fail
[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:24.520]   and they
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:24.860]   come back.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.060]   Remember
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:25.500]   the question
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:25.860]   that Jesus
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.000]   asked Peter
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.640]   to restore
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:27.920]   him?
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.680]   So not
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.020]   only do
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:30.320]   you know
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:30.560]   me,
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.160]   do you
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:31.740]   love me?
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.400]   Do you
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.020]   love me more
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.540]   than these?
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.460]   because that
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:37.820]   was the
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.600]   central point
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.260]   of everything
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:39.900]   in Scripture.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.040]   When we
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.300]   are in
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.400]   the presence
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.060]   of Christ
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.560]   to test
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.140]   to see
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.340]   if we
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.660]   have matured,
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.220]   to test
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:49.500]   to see
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:49.900]   where we
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.280]   are,
