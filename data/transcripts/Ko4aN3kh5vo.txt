[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.220]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.220]   I think as you guys can see, you notice that we are BAM.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.220]   Our singles ministry is up at a retreat,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.220]   and so they'll be there,
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   and they're having their own service there,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.220]   and they'll be coming down this afternoon,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.220]   and that's part of the reason why you'll see less people.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.220]   There's over 220, 230 people up there.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.220]   Was the cafe open?
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.220]   Oh, it was open.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.220]   Oh, okay, okay, that's good.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.220]   They were threatening us
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   that they didn't have enough workers, so, okay.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.220]   They were able to find more workers.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.220]   We have an announcement from our brother, Teddy,
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.220]   for the fundraiser that's coming.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.220]   - Good morning.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   My name's Teddy Shea from the BAM Logistics Team.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.220]   We are happy to announce
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.220]   that the Breen Service Auction this year
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.220]   is taking place April 21st to April 27th,
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.220]   and the proceeds from this year's auction
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.220]   is going to the Korean Missions Fund for the summer.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.220]   So just like in past years,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   we're excited to see what sorts of talents,
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.220]   what sorts of items, special boxes, baked goods,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.220]   whatever you can think of that will be available for bid.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.220]   Just want to let you know and remind you
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   that it's the Breen members only,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.220]   so if you want additional details,
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.220]   make sure you check out the Breen members Facebook group.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   So we will be sending out an email later today
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220]   for you to be able to fill out the form
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.220]   and add all your details and your pictures.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.220]   Also, note about the pictures.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.220]   If you don't attach a picture, just like last year,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.220]   I may attach a meme instead to represent your item
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   if I can't figure out what picture you actually wanted.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.220]   So just letting you all know that.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.220]   Thanks.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.220]   All right, just to give a quick recap,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.220]   those of you who don't know what we do annually,
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.220]   we have a service auction, so it can be a product
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.220]   or it can be a service or talent
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.220]   or even babysitting or whatever it may be,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   and then the church members will bid for that,
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.220]   and then the funds that are coming in for that
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.220]   will be used for summer missions
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.220]   that's going on this summer in Korea,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.220]   just to give you a heads up.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.220]   This week, we have all church praise and prayer,
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.220]   so we won't have regular Bible study during the weekday,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.220]   but at 7:30, and again, our theme this year
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.220]   is praying in the Spirit,
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.220]   and so we really want to encourage you
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.220]   that this year, not just leadership,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.220]   but the church as a whole
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.220]   really focuses on growing in prayer.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.220]   And so even this Friday, as you come,
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.220]   we want to encourage you to prepare to pray,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.220]   not just come to pray,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.220]   but I know there are some people who fast dinner
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.220]   or pray over other things,
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.220]   or sometimes they'll have a prayer meeting
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.220]   even before they come just so that they can have
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.220]   a better time of prayer when they come,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.220]   and so we want to encourage you to do your best
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.220]   to try to come to that for corporate prayer at 7:30.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.220]   This coming Sunday, not this Sunday,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.220]   but next Sunday, at this time at 9:30,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.220]   bring in babysitting, okay?
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.220]   So this is for children
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.220]   who are 12 months to 17 months old,
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.220]   so there's a new babysitting ministry
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.220]   that's going to be happening on the other side,
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   and so if you come to the other side of the building,
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.220]   there's two glass doors
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.220]   that you enter through.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.220]   That's the room that they'll be using,
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   so they have, again, cushioned carpet,
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.220]   and all the other stuff is being prepared for that.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   So if you have children during this service
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.220]   between 12 and 17 months, next Sunday.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.220]   And so if you have any questions about that,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   you can contact Sarah De Los Santos,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   and she'll give you more information about that.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.220]   Next Sunday, at 2 o'clock,
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.220]   they're starting their Old Testament survey,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.220]   so if you've signed up for that after lunch,
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.220]   come back at 2 o'clock to 3.30,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.220]   and this is a six-weeks course,
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.220]   and again, if you haven't taken this,
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.220]   it will tremendously help you to understand the Bible,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.220]   so I encourage you to take that class.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.220]   And then finally, on March 9th at 9 a.m.,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.220]   we have all-church cleaning and maintenance day,
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.220]   so as I mentioned, more people come out,
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.220]   the quicker and more thorough we can clean the church,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.220]   so if you're able to come,
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.220]   even if you can just come for a partial part of the day,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220]   most likely it will last from 9 to maybe about 12 o'clock,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   so you have the rest of the day to do something else,
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   so if you can come,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.220]   they'll have a quick meeting to assign you
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.220]   to different things that need to be done in the church,
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.220]   so if you can come, please sign up for that
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.220]   on March 9th at 9 a.m.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.220]   Everything else, I'm just going to refer you to our website.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.220]   Okay, this morning, after our offering,
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.220]   after I prayed for our offering,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.220]   and after our praise time,
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.220]   our sister Tasha is going to come up,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220]   and she's going to give her testimony,
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.220]   and she'll be baptized this morning,
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220]   so let me pray for us, and again,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.220]   if you are not transitioning to subsplash,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.220]   we encourage you to do that.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.220]   We have one more month.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.220]   We're going to give you a grace period in March,
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.220]   and then at the end of March,
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.220]   we will no longer be able to accept things through Zelle,
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.220]   at least on the main offering,
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.220]   or again, our offering box is in the back,
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.220]   and there's envelopes there,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.220]   so you can drop off your offering there, all right?
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   Let me pray for us.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   Father, we thank you so much
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.220]   for the privilege that we have
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.220]   to be able to come and call you our Abba Father.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.220]   We especially want to lift up our singles ministry
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   as they are up at the retreat,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   and I pray that you will continue
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.220]   to bless them and unite them,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   that there will be true fellowship, Lord God,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.220]   where they are partnering together
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.220]   for the purpose of your kingdom,
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.220]   that your grace truly will be sufficient,
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.220]   and that they would be sanctified,
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.220]   encouraged, and equipped for every good work, Lord,
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.220]   that you have called us to.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.220]   We pray this morning for our offering,
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.220]   that you would help us, Lord God,
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.220]   to give it to you intentionally, joyfully,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.220]   and may it be multiplied, Lord God,
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.220]   that it may be used for your kingdom.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   (gentle piano music)
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.060]   (gentle piano music continues)

[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:49.820]   - Let us all rise as we continue our service,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.820]   but before we do, if we could spend a few moments
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.820]   to greet our neighbors.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   (gentle piano music)

[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   This next song is a new song
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   called "Behold Him."
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.500]   And as we sing it,
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   you will see that
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   at the end of each verse
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   and chorus
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500]   is a call to behold our God.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.500]   And to behold
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.500]   is more than just to notice,
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   but it is rather to gaze
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   and to look intently upon.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   So as we sing
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   about His everlasting nature,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500]   His humble
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   and compassionate love,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   about who He is,
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.500]   and His victorious triumph
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   over sin
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.500]   through His death
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   and resurrection,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.500]   may it cause in us
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.500]   greater praise
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.500]   and honor to Him.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.420]   (gentle piano music)

[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:24.260]   - Hello, my name is Tasha.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.260]   I am a student at CSU Long Beach.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.260]   My testimony starts off like a lot of people.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.260]   I grew up going to church,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   serving in the children's ministry,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   going to youth groups and youth camps.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.260]   I was doing all the right things
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.260]   and believed that Jesus came down to save us from our sin,
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.260]   but it was all just mindless believing.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.260]   I have gotten baptized before,
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.260]   the summer between seventh and eighth grade,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.260]   but looking back, I did not truly understand
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.260]   what it meant to be baptized
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.260]   and the most important factor, I had yet to call Jesus,
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.260]   not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.260]   High school came and I was constantly trying
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.260]   to find things to blame God for and avoiding my own sin.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.260]   I blamed Him for why I didn't have the perfect family
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.260]   with two parents, why He let my biological parents give me up,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.260]   money like all of my friends' families did,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.260]   the list goes on.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   I was extremely ungrateful for what God had provided me with,
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.260]   allowing me to even grow up
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.260]   in a loving home that taught God's word.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.260]   Going to college, God placed wonderful people in my life,
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.260]   exemplifying His love and mercy.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.260]   I was learning not only that I needed to have faith
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.180]   but also what it means to walk with the Lord
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   and surrender all things to Him.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.180]   I was doing all these things
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.180]   and wanted to seem like the perfect Christian,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.180]   but in the back of my mind, it still felt artificial.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.180]   However, in my avoidance of self,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.180]   I pushed it back and kept going on.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   I was comfortable with where I was.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.180]   I desired things like relationships,
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.180]   praise from peers, money,
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.180]   and still cared about what others thought of me
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.180]   rather than God.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.180]   I recognized all these things I desired but not of God
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.180]   and it was sin, but I still could not completely understand
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.100]   or forgive all the terrible things I had done.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   Talking with older sisters in church and AACF,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   I was challenged for the first time in my faith.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   I spent a lot of time reflecting over and asking questions.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.100]   I was finally able to be in the Word,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   not just to gain head knowledge
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.100]   for when I'm talking to others,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.100]   but to truly know who God is.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.100]   Romans 3, 23, 24 says,
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.100]   "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.100]   "and all are justified freely by His grace
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.100]   "through the freedom that came by Jesus Christ."
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.020]   At this point, I was focusing so much
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   on how I was a sinner and forgot the whole reason
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.020]   God sent down His Son to live on earth
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   and eventually die on the cross.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.020]   It was to save us from our sin.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.020]   I had to die to myself and recognize
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.020]   how much I needed God.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.020]   As I move on with life, I am constantly learning
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.020]   what it means to walk a Christian life
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   as a daughter of the Father
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   and I can rejoice in His love
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.020]   and the promises that He has fulfilled.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.020]   He has shown me so much of my sin
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.020]   by constantly humbling me
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.020]   to what true confession and repentance is.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.020]   I can say with full confidence
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   that my hope is in the Lord
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   and He is not only my Savior,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.020]   but Lord over my life.
