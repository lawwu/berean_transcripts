[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   Just to kind of give you a heads up,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   next Sunday we have our communion service that's happening,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   so please come prepared for that.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   Our next child safety training.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   If you are working with children at our church
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.800]   in any capacity, this is a mandatory training,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   so if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   it's happening next Sunday at 1.30 at the youth chapel,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   so please sign up for that.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   Next Sunday is the beginning of the college study hall,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   so you guys are already at the end of the quarter,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   and so if you want to bring snacks
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   or anything to kind of encourage our college students
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   to focus on their studies,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   you can just bring it and then drop it off
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   in the cafe area, and so that'll be helpful to them.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   Again, so that's starting next Sunday
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.800]   at 6 p.m., and then I am told
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   that the VBS sign-up closes tomorrow.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   Yeah, tomorrow.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   So if you are planning to bring your child to the VBS,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   I think there is a sign-up table outside
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   so you can go visit it and then sign up
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   or you can do it online,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   but the registration is closing tomorrow,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   so if you haven't done so,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   we encourage you to do that as soon as possible.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   Then, as I mentioned last week,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   our lot behind us is officially closed,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.800]   so if you park there today,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   you're parking at your own risk,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   but officially that lot is going to be closed
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   for the time being,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   and so because of that, our Alliant parking lot,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   our parking lot here, our cafe area,
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   and then the parking to the left of us,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   that spot has about 20 spots,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   so that's going to be reserved
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   for families with small children,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   and so please park there,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   and then otherwise you can kind of park
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.800]   in other areas, so please reserve that
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   for the young families
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   so that they don't have to walk on the streets
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   or wait for the shuttle.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   So please remember that lot for the time being,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   unless we figure something out with them,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   have conversation,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   and we're able to open that lot up
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   so that back lot is going to be officially closed.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   The lot that we have in lot G,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   if you look at the map, you have H and G.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   The G lot was where a bulk of our parking was happening,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   and I'm assuming some of you may have done that,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.720]   but the lot G for temporary,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   and this is just for the time being,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   will be closed on Sunday,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   so if we have weekday activity
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   or Friday night praise and prayer,
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   that lot will be open,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   but for now, Sunday, lot G is going to be closed,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   and we're asking most of you to go to lot J, okay?
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   So if you're going to be shuttled,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   lot J is where you would want to go,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   and so it's a huge parking lot,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   and that's where our shuttle is going to be
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   making the rotation to come around, pick you up,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.720]   and so maybe some of you guys have already done that.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Again, so lot G, until further notice,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   try not to park there,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   and then there will be shuttle
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   that is coming to lot H if you do need to,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   but because there's going to be smaller number there,
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   the shuttle is not going to be rotating that frequently,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   but the larger part of the shuttles
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   are going to be going to lot J, okay?
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   And there's plenty of parking there,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   so please keep that in mind,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   and I think that's all I have for today.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.720]   And let me pray for the offering,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   and then after the pray set,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   our sister Jasmine is going to come up
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   and give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   Father, we thank you for the privilege
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   that we have to be able to come before your throne
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   to worship you and give you thanks, Lord God,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   for all that you've given.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   Help us to fix our eyes upon Christ
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   that our worship that we give you
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   will truly be sincerely from our hearts.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   We pray that all that we are doing this morning
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   will be a pleasing aroma to you,
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   that even this giving that we give
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   may it be an act of worship,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   and to be handled wisely, Lord God,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:51.640]   (soft piano music)
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   As we stand for worship,
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   let's just take a moment to greet those around us.

[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   >> Good morning.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   My name is Jasmine Juarez and this is my testimony.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   I grew up going to church, attending every Friday and
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   Sunday.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   Even though I heard the word every Friday and Sunday, I
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   never understood why it should matter.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.240]   As the years passed, I continued to think of ways to
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   get out of hearing about the word.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   When I was 11 years old, I was selected to be part of a
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   group of kids that would play instruments and sing on
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   Sunday to the kids.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   I saw this as an excuse to hang out with my friends and
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   never understood the depth of what I was doing and the
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   offense it was to the Lord.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   Almost every Sunday, I would stand on the stage and sing
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   songs towards the Lord, but all the while, my heart would
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   just continue to harden.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.240]   Towards the end of my eighth grade, my family hit a rough
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   patch and decided to leave the church we were attending.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   At the time, I had gotten angry at God and questioned if he
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   was so good, why were so many bad things happening in my
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   life?
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   At the end of my freshman year, COVID started, and
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   suddenly I went from interacting with people who I
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   got my validation from to being stuck in a room which I
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   shared with my sister.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   In my time of being alone, I started to see how the people
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   I had chosen to surround myself were having a bad
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.240]   influence on me.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   I had started cursing and finding pleasure in the lust
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   that the world held to provide.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   After I came to the realization, I decided to
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   distance myself from them.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   As as days passed, I felt as though I was in an endless
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   cycle of scrolling through the apps on my phone but never
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   finding any true joy in it.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   During this time, the sister I shared a room with had started
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   Bible study at Berean via Zoom.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   I noticed that while I was struggling mentally, she seemed
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   happier and started wondering what she knew that I didn't.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.240]   Towards the beginning of my junior year, I started
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   attending the youth group at Berean.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   During this time, I was truly hearing for the first time
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   about how much of a sinner I was and how there is a God
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   whose love was so great that he would send his only son to
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   die for our sins.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   It was then that the Holy Spirit had started to warm my
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   heart, but still my heart wanted to hold on to what the
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240]   world could give me.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   During my senior year of high school, I was continuing to
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   pray that the Lord would give life to my heart all the while
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.240]   rendering my heart.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   During my freshman year of college, God revealed to me
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.240]   that I had tricked myself into thinking that if I tried hard
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   enough, I would be able to stop myself from sinning, and
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   only then would I be able to come before God in true
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   repentance.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   Towards the end of my freshman year of college, I was going
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   through Romans with a classmate.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   Romans 3, 23-24 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   the glory of God, being justified as a gift by his
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   grace through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ."
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.240]   Jesus had me in tears because I was overcome with these
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   feelings of gratitude and love.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   And through it all, it finally clicked that only God had the
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   power to forgive me and wash my sins away, that nothing I do
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   could save me and all my tries would be meaningless because
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   I'm such a wretched sinner and I have no strength to do
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   otherwise.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.240]   That night, I came before the Lord asking for forgiveness in
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   true repentance, declaring him as my Lord and Savior, and
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   praying for his will to be done, not mine.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.160]   Now, as I continue to wrestle with sin, I know that I am
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   redeemed because he is my Savior who has defeated all sin.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   Thank you.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   [applause]
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   [no audio]
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   [no audio]
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   [applause]
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   >> All right, thank you, Yasmin, for that encouraging
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   testimony.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   This morning, as you can see by the way that I'm dressed, I'm
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   not speaking.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   If you are a member of the church, you probably got an
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   email and you saw the post on our Facebook page that we have
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.920]   a new pastor that's joining our family.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   And he's not new to us as far as our community is concerned
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   because he's spoken at our church many times.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   If I can ask them to come and they're going to see--so you
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   can at least see who I'm talking about.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   All right, so Pastor Sung and his wife, Becky.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   Yeah, you can clap for them.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   [applause]
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   So as you guys know, Pastor Sung has spoken at our church
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   many times.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.920]   He gave his testimony and our Good Friday sermon, I think
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   about three to four years ago.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   And then he's spoken at our FAM 245.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   He's spoken at our men's conferencing, the searchlight.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   And so I know many of you are already very familiar with him.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   And again, you'll get to read about his--I'm not going to go
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   through the whole thing, but you'll get to know him better.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   He is going to be serving in our college department.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   And so, again, all the details of his background, I'm sure
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   you'll find out more.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   But we're very excited to welcome him.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   Becky, his wife, actually was an old-time member of our church.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   She came to our church when she was a sophomore junior
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   in college.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   And then she was with us, I forgot, 15-plus years, right?
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   She was with us for a long time.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   And then when we were very active in China, she was out
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   there representing us in China for about eight months.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   And then she also, you know, early on when we went to
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   Romania, so she was on that trip as well.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.840]   She was a very integral part of our church when our church
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   was much smaller.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   And then about eight years ago, they met.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   And then Becky asked me to go and check this guy out, you
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   know, to make sure that he's legit.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   And so I remember meeting him for the first time,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   coming back, encouraged.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   Sounds like you met a genuine believer in Christ who's going
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   to serve together.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   And so we were saddened, obviously, you know,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   after they got married.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.840]   They said goodbye to Becky, but it was not God's will for them
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   to be away for long, okay?
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   So they're -- again, so even though they're new as an
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   official, officially new today, they've actually been a part of
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   our church kind of in and out for a while.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   So I'm sure many of you are familiar.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   And they've been attending our church, just even just
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   attending for the last month or so.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   And so, again, I just want to introduce you to them,
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   and then you'll have plenty of time to get to know them better.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.840]   Because today is the first official day that they're
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   being announced.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   I wanted to introduce you to them.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   So let's give them a warm welcome.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   Then Pastor Sung's going to come and deliver the message.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   [Applause]
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   >> Again, thank you, Pastor Peter,
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   for that introduction.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   That's the second time he had to do that today.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   And then we're looking for the third one.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   Before we open our text, I want to thank all of you for
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.840]   welcoming me and my wife, Becky, with open arms.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   I want to thank the Berean leadership for giving me an
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   opportunity to serve Berean Community Church as an
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   undershepherd of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   For many of you who are not familiar with me,
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   I would like to formally introduce myself to you.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   As Pastor Peter had mentioned, my name is Sung.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   I've been an ordained minister since 2018.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   I'm married to my wonderful wife, Becky,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   who is not here now.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   She left.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.840]   But we had the joy of having two beautiful sons,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   Matthew and Amos, who, according to the sovereign
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   purpose of our God, have gone before us to be with the Lord.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   And we are eagerly waiting and hope to see them again
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   in glory.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   My wife, Becky, as Pastor Peter had mentioned,
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   was a member of Berean Community Church since 2000s
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   until I wooed her and I took her away from the community
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   that she so loved.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   But I've learned over the years that though you take the girl
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.840]   out of Berean, you can never take Berean out of the girl.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   Berean is very near and dear to my wife's heart.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   This is her home church.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   And she made mention of that to me several times.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   But I'm very happy that this is her home church,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   and now it has become mine.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   Berean had a tremendous impact on Becky
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   and on her spiritual development.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   You know, the valuable lessons that she had learned here
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.840]   actually played an important part in her transition
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.840]   from a pastor's wife.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   And today, I've been an undeserving beneficiary
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   of all her efforts since.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   And even though Becky left Berean in 2017,
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   we remain connected to Berean through many relationships
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   that she had established over the 13-plus years
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   that she's been here.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   And as a result, I was able to establish relationships
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   with many of the brothers and sisters here at Berean
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   who I consider as family today.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.840]   Prior to Berean, I had been involved
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   with various Christian ministries since 2010.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   I was a lead pastor of a church plant for a few years
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   until we had to close the church in 2024
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   due to unforeseen circumstances.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   But like Pastor Peter said,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   God led us back to Berean to worship Him
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.840]   and to be equipped with His Word.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   And we are very happy to be a part of a faithful community
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   that honors God in worship,
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   holds to the authority of the Holy Scriptures,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.840]   and sincerely has a burden for the lost.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.840]   And so I'm tremendously blessed
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   to be a part of this faithful community
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   that welcomed us,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   and I really look forward to serving all of you
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   in the many days to come.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   Having said that, I want to invite you
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   to turn with me in your Bibles
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   to 1 Peter chapter 5.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   1 Peter chapter 5,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   and we're reading verses 1 and 4 this morning,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   and I've titled our morning's message
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   "An Exhortation to Spiritual Leaders."
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.760]   And these are the inspired words of the Lord.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   "Therefore, I exhort the elders among you,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   "as your fellow elder and witness
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   "of the sufferings of Christ
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   "and a partaker also of the glory
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   "that is to be revealed,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   "shepherd the flock of God among you,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   "exercising oversight,
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   "not under compulsion, but voluntarily,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   "according to the will of God
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   "and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness,
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   "nor yet as lording it over those
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.760]   "who are loaded to your charge,
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   "but proving to be examples to the flock.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   "And when the chief shepherd appears,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   "you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Father, thank you for allowing me
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   to have this honor
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   of sharing the word
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   with your people this morning.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   And as I do this introspection,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   I do pray that you would convict
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   and challenge me to remind me
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   of the task that is at hand
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   and to serve faithfully.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.760]   And I pray for all of us
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   that you would give us ears to hear
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   and help us, Lord,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   to practice the things that we have heard
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   so that we are not deceiving ourselves.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   So thank you again for this time
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   and we pray this in the name
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   of our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Amen. Amen.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   As you know,
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   the church is in need of faithful leaders,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.760]   not just in times of hardship and persecution,
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   but especially in times
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   of prosperity and ease.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.760]   And unfortunately,
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.760]   the current climate of Western Christianity
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   has generated some unfaithful men
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   to occupy the pulpit.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   And because there are unfaithful men
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   who occupy the pulpit
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.760]   with little to no accountability,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   these men hurt the reputation
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   of the church and its members
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   with their moral failures.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   And as Prophet Nathan told David
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   when confronting him
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   of his sin with Bathsheba,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   unfaithful men in leadership
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.760]   are often called names.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   Just in the previous year,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.760]   several well-known pastors
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   shocked the evangelical world
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   with their sins,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   bringing reproach not only to themselves
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   but to the message that they proclaim.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   And because of the spiritual abuse
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   of some pastors,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   many Christians have been hurt
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   and are left asking the question,
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   "What is going on?"
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   And so what I want to do today
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   is place a mirror in the direction
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   of the pulpit for some introspection
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.680]   and what we are to expect
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   from pastors called to the ministry.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680]   And so I humbly ask
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.680]   that you bear with me
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.680]   as I place myself front and center
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.680]   for your analysis.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   In the opening four verses
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   of Chapter 5,
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   Peter directs his exhortation
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   to leaders in the church
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   and he urges them to fulfill
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   their spiritual responsibility
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   by faithfully shepherding
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   the Lord's flock.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.680]   We know that the Lord's flock
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   is on purpose.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   You see, it is not a coincidence
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   that the Word of God
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   uses an analogy of sheep
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   to describe Christ's followers.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   And not to offend anyone
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   here this morning,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.680]   but we share some similar traits
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   with sheep.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   Without getting into all the details,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.680]   sheep depend their lives
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   on shepherds.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   And a shepherd must continually
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.680]   do what is necessary.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Sheep have great dependence
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   on shepherds.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   A shepherd who is careful,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   a shepherd who is thoughtful,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   a shepherd who is watchful
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   and knowledgeable,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   a shepherd who plans,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   a shepherd who provides,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   and a shepherd who protects his sheep.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   And this is because sheep
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   without a shepherd
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   are just vulnerable creatures
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   that face extreme danger
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.680]   in the wilderness.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   Sheep without a shepherd
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   face extreme danger.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   And this is why a shepherd
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   must continually be on guard
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   and defend and rescue sheep.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.680]   They must guide them
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.680]   from going astray,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   lead them to green pastures
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.680]   and still waters,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   and protect them from predators
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   looking for an easy meal.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.680]   And Peter understood
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   the spiritual analogy
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.680]   of a shepherd.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   A shepherd must guide
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   his sheep to green pastures
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   to shepherd them.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   Since believers like sheep
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   are prone to wander,
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   indiscriminately take in
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   what is bad,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   often become unclean,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   are highly vulnerable
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   and defenseless on their own,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   the demand for faithful
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   shepherds are high.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   And so in these opening verses
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.680]   is the first word of exhortation
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   to all the elders in the church.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   And the first exhortation is this,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   "Shepherd the flock of God."
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   Peter said it more specifically
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   in verse 2,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   "Shepherd the flock of God
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   among you."
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   Now the key word here is shepherd.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   Peter, who is a fellow elder himself,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   is asking other elders
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   to shepherd the flock of God.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   And you know,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   the responsibility of a shepherd
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   is very serious.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.600]   In Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   "Obey your leaders
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   and submit to them."
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   Why?
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   Because they keep watch
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   over your souls
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   as those who will have
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   to give an account.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   And when we look at this passage,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   there are two sides
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   to the command in Hebrews chapter 13,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   verse 17.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   The immediate command
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   is to the congregation
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.600]   to come away from myself
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   and place it towards you.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   And I want to briefly talk
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   about the congregation's responsibility
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   to its pastors.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   And it's simple.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   When a pastor is in the will of God,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   teaching the Word of God,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.600]   and he is faithful,
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   the people of God
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   should obey and submit
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   to his leadership.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   When a pastor is overseeing the church
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   with love and humility,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.600]   those under his leadership
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   should submit in love
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   and humility.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   We should,
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   as the Word of God commands
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   verse 12 and 13,
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   "Appreciate those
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   who diligently labor among you
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   and have charge over you
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   in the Lord and give you instruction
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   and that you esteem them
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   very highly in love
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   because of their work."
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.600]   They are serving and laboring
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   faithfully among us.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   In the Old Testament,
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   the Lord rebuked Israel
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   for not heeding the words
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   of the prophets he had sent to them.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   And this is what he said.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   He said to them
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   in Jeremiah chapter 26
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   verses 4 through 5,
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   "If you will not listen to me
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   to walk in my law
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   which I have set before you
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   to listen to the words
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.600]   of the Lord.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   These are the words from the Lord
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   regarding his faithful servants
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   that the people have refused
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   to listen to.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   God communicated with his people
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   with the agents of prophets
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   in the Old Testament
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   and because the people
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   refused to listen
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   to the Lord's prophets
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   when he sent to them
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   again and again."
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   In that following passage
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.600]   he says to you this morning is this,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   "Do not repeat
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   the mistake of Israel.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   Submit to spiritual leaders
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   who are faithful,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   who have been divinely appointed
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   to shepherd your souls
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   and let them serve with joy
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   because this will be beneficial
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   for you."
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   And the second aspect
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   of the command,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   though implied,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   is for pastors to keep watch
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.600]   and when you think about
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   the responsibility of overseeing
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   not just the temporal
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   but the immortal souls of man
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   that is a tremendous task.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   A task that often compels pastors
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   to stay up at night
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   with intercession and supplication
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   meditating on the scripture
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   in order to present to his congregation
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   the words of God that pertains
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   to life and godliness.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   And this brings us back
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   to the subject of shepherding
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.600]   and I'm going to reposition
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   this metaphorical mirror back to myself
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   so you can breathe a sigh of relief.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   I didn't go too far.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   But I want to say that pastors
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   are ultimately accountable to God.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   Pastors are given oversight
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   of the Lord's church and we are
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   responsible to shepherd his people.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   The objective of shepherding
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   is to care for the sheep
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   and one of the main ways
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   in which shepherds care for their sheep
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.600]   is to provide them with good food.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.600]   Faithful pastors give to his congregation
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   the words of God
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   which is profitable for teaching,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   for reproof, for correction
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   and for training in righteousness
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.600]   that you may be adequately equipped
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   for every good work.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.600]   And this is why one of the qualifications
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   of a pastor mentioned
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   in 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 2
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.600]   is that he must be a skillful teacher
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.600]   and he must be prepared
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   to teach the word of God
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   even when the word of God
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.600]   is rejected by men.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   One of the main
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   responsibilities of a shepherd
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   is to feed the flock of God.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   Yes, shepherds must protect.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   We must have oversight
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   to keep the flock together
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   but the way in which pastors can do this
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   is to lead the people of God
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   with the inspired words of God.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   Peter understood this assignment
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   because when he was forgiven
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   by the Lord and recommissioned
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   to the work of an apostle
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.600]   Jesus commanded him and said
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   in John chapter 21
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.600]   and I'm just going to summarize this
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   for time's sake.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   He said to Peter, Peter
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   since you love me
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   I want you to take care
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   of my sheep and tend to them.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   And the word tend
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   can also be translated
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   as feed.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   Peter was commanded
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   to feed the flock of God
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   and what is it that the Lord
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.600]   the God that pertains everything
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   to life and godliness
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   and that is exactly what Peter
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   is expressing in our present passage.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   The things which he had heard
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   the things which he had seen
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   from the Lord is now being passed
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   on to spiritual leaders
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   of every generation
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   to shepherd the flock of God
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   by feeding them divine truth.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   And knowing that pastors
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   are commissioned to shepherd
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   the Lord's flock
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.600]   who are pastors asked to shepherd?
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   Are pastors
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   responsible to shepherd everyone
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   without exception?
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   Notice in verse 2
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   Peter exhorts pastors
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   to shepherd believers that are among
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   them.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   Now we have to understand
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   local church pastors are called to shepherd
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   the flock of God among them.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   Pastors are given
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   for the equipping of believers
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   not non-believers.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   And when I say this I'm not suggesting
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.520]   that pastors do not have a responsibility
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   for the lost.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.520]   We do have a responsibility for the lost
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   and that responsibility is to evangelize
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   the lost to bring them to Christ
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   with the presentation of the gospel.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   But the church
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   by definition is a gathering
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   of believers called out from the world
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   to worship God.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   That is the main purpose of church.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   It is a gathering place
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   for worshiping God
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   and also to be equipped with the word of God
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   for the work of ministry.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.440]   The church is not a gathering of non-believers.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   Non-believers do not
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   worship God nor do they have a desire
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   to know God.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   The word of God tells us in 1 Corinthians
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   chapter 2 verse 14 that an unregenerate
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   person does not accept
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   the things of the spirit of God.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   The church is a gathering
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   of believers and pastors are ordained
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   to shepherd believers not non-believers.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   We read
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   in Ephesians chapter 4
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   verses 11 and 12 that Jesus
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.440]   came to the world, redeemed his people,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   went back to heaven, sent the
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   spirit of God to enable gifted men
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   to build up what?
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   The body of Christ.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   The body of believers.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   Pastors are under-shepherds
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   meaning they serve under the authority
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.440]   of Christ
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.440]   and they are entrusted with the care
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.440]   of the Lord's people by Christ.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.440]   You belong to him
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   and he has appointed gifted men
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   to oversee his church which are the
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.440]   people of God.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   And you know on a side note
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   because I fear God
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   I do have a genuine fear
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   for those who deliberately attempt
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   to lead the Lord's people astray
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   because one day they're going to
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   have to stand before Christ
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   and give an accounting to him.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   God said
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   in Jeremiah chapter 23
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   verses 1 and 2, "Woe to the shepherds
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   who destroy and scatter the sheep
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   of my pasture," says the Lord.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.440]   "Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   against the shepherds who feed my people
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   you have scattered my flock
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   driven them away
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   and not attended to them.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   Behold I will attend to you for the
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   evil of your doings," says the Lord.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   The Lord himself
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   says I will repay false shepherds
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   for their wrongdoings.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   And knowing this truth I don't know how
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   anyone can occupy the pulpit
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   with the intention of leading
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   the Lord's people astray.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   And this is why pastors
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.360]   have to examine themselves before
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.360]   occupying the pulpit.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   They have to examine themselves before
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   they come up here and teach the word
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.360]   of God and says, "Thou says the Lord."
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   Because we know that we are
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   responsible for the Lord's people.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   Yes, it is commendable to seek
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   the office of an overseer
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   but it comes with scrutiny
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   and a warning to those who teach
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.360]   that those who teach will receive
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   a stricter judgment from God.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   I often remind myself
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   of the Apostle Paul's address
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.280]   to Ephesus.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   In Acts chapter 20 verses 28
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   Paul gathered the elders
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   and this is what he told them.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   "Be on guard for yourselves
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   and for all the flock among which
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   the Holy Spirit has made you overseers
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   to shepherd the church of God
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   which he purchased with his own blood."
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   That's how precious you are
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   to the Lord.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   It is a tremendous responsibility
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   to shepherd the Lord's flock.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   It is a tremendous responsibility
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.280]   to shepherd God's people.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   God's people who are
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   redeemed by his precious blood.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   I mentioned earlier
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   I have been attending
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   at the beginning of this year
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   and I witnessed the pastors
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   of Berean dedicate themselves
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   to this body with unwavering devotion.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   I'm personally very thankful
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   to God for not just our pastors
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   but even the elders who are here
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   because they sincerely serve
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   this body with love
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.280]   because the leaders do it behind the scenes
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   when no one is watching.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   I witnessed Pastor Peter
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   faithfully minister to you
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   with the word every week
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   and you received in my opinion
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   a seminary style teaching
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   from Pastor Mark and hermeneutics
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   and none of you had to pay a tuition fee.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   It was free.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   And Pastor Nate
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   and I'm saying all this
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   because they're not here.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   I'm boasting about them
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.280]   but Pastor Nate
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   I mean what doesn't he do right?
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.280]   He wears multiple hats
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   around here.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   He's like the Swiss army knife
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   of pastors.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   He's just everywhere
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   and you know I had a chance
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   to follow him this past week
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   and just witnessing this man
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   and his commitment to the collegians
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   is very admirable
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   and these are just some
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   of the commitments that are
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.280]   but the work that they do
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   behind the scenes are even more commendable.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   Again the pastors
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   will never tell you this themselves
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   so I'm going to do it for them.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   Okay.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.280]   But I
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   recently got a glimpse of Pastor Peter's
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   weekly schedule
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.280]   and I was floored
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   by how
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   just one man
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   can have so many responsibilities
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   in just one day.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.280]   And I want you to know
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   that your pastors
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   are doing their best
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   to delegate their tasks
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   so that a church of this size
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   doesn't seem so big to you.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   They do their best
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   to meet everyone in need
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   all the while carrying on
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   their ministerial duties at church.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   They exhort you
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   they comfort you
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   with the heart of a father
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   and they do all of this
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.280]   so that you may walk worthy of God
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   who has called you into his
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   eternal kingdom.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   And so when you get a chance
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   thank the Lord that you have faithful leaders
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   who are committed to shepherding you
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   who sincerely care about your
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   spiritual maturity.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   I remember in one of his sermons
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   Pastor Peter shared the conversation
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   that he had in which he answered a question
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   and the question was
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   how are you able to speak for all three services?
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   Aren't you tired?
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.280]   And Pastor Peter simply said
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   it's my joy.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   It's my joy
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   to minister to the people
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   of God.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   Even though he is physically tired
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   and his knees are about
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   to give out
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   his aging knee
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   the joy of serving
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   the Lord's body is what keeps this man going.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   And I wrote in my notes
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   what he said that day.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   Pastor Peter said
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.280]   and this is a quote from Pastor Peter
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   Your pastor
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   he said we are able to rejoice
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   be thankful
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   not when my
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   pursuits are achieved
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   but because of what I have
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   in Christ.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   Those are
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   the words of a man who can rejoice
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   in all circumstances and be thankful
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   because of what he has in Christ.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   And you know I was encouraged
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.280]   to hear those words from Pastor Peter
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.280]   who doesn't just say the word
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   but actually models what he says.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   Brian
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   you are tremendously blessed
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.280]   to have faithful leaders here.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   Then in verses 2 and 3
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   we see instructions on how elders are to
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   shepherd the Lord's flock.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   We are to shepherd the Lord's flock
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   with integrity and honesty.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   He said
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   shepherd the flock of God among you
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.280]   exercising oversight not under
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   compulsion but voluntarily
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.280]   according to the will of God and not for
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   sordid game but with eagerness
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   nor yet as lording it over those
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   allotted to your charge but proving to be
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   examples to the flock.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   Now in this imperative
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   to shepherding the Lord's flock
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   there are both positives and also negatives.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   First I want us to
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   observe the positive ways
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   to shepherd the Lord's flock
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   and I'll go through these quickly.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   Peter says in verse 2
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.200]   shepherd the flock of God.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   Now what does it mean
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   to oversee?
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   The word oversight is translated
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   from the Greek word of pescapel
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   and its basic definition
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   means to accept responsibility
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   for the care of other people.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   And this word has
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   the idea of positioning oneself
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   on a high place to scope
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   things out to watch over
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   and just as we have read
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   in Hebrews we watch over the souls
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   of men.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.120]   And what does it look like for pastors to watch
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   over the flock of God?
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   Well we do this first of all in prayer.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   We pray
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.120]   for the sheep. We pray for the Lord's people.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   And
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   secondly we diligently study God's
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.120]   word so that we may
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   present the words of God to you that has
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   life and godly instructions.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   And then we're always
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   keeping a watch for the encroachment of error
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   that constantly undermines
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.120]   and attacks the authority of the scripture.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.120]   (Pause)
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   We have
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   oversight of the Lord's people.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   Secondly
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   pastors are to be examples
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   to the flock.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   Pastors are to lead by example.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   And this is why
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   the qualification of a pastor to have
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   a reputation that is above reproach
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   is extremely important.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   Pastors are to be
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   involved in the lives of those that he is shepherding
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   and to model
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.120]   a pattern that the people can follow.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   And so you see
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   it's not just leadership from on high where we have
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   oversight. It is also leadership
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   from within. There's a balance.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   A shepherd needs
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   to balance both tasks.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   A shepherd must keep watch on the high place
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   to get a scope of what is happening all around them.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   He must look out for predators.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   He must be on the lookout for wandering sheep.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   He must be an overseer
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   of the Lord's flock.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   But before the day is over
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.120]   a shepherd comes down from his watch.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   He walks in the midst of the flock
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   to check the condition of the flock.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   He looks for the ones that are sick.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   The ones that aren't eating well.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   The ones that are injured. The ones that are
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   hurting. And he shepherds them.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   A shepherd
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   balances both tasks.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   He has oversight to protect,
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   provide, and guide. But he is also
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   an example to the people of God.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   And he does this by being within.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.120]   These are the
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.120]   positive ways to shepherd the Lord's flock.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   But
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   there's also a negative way in which
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   pastors can abuse the Lord's people.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.120]   And the Apostle Peter
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.120]   warns pastors should never
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   shepherd the Lord, the flock of God
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   in this manner.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.120]   He said in verse 2,
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   "Not under compulsion, but voluntarily
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   according to the will of God
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   and not for sordid gain,
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   but with eagerness.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   Nor yet as lording it over those
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.120]   under your charge."
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   The first
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   negative thing we notice is compulsion.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.120]   Shepherding the Lord's flock
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   because you are pressured into doing it,
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   not because you want to do it.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   If a pastor
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   needs someone to constantly push him
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   because he is not motivated by the
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   compelling and the love of Christ
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   to shepherd his people, he has a
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   serious problem.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.120]   Peter says if you're
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   in a situation where someone has to force
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.120]   you to do the work of shepherding
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.040]   the Lord's people, don't do it.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.040]   Because if you're
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   forced into shepherding the Lord's people,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   eventually you will grumble
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   and you will quit.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   Pastoral
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   ministry is not for men who have to be
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   pushed to perform the task
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   of shepherding his people.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   If a man is going to
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.040]   shepherd the people of God, he must do it
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.040]   under divine compulsion
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.040]   and not under the compulsion of men.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.040]   He must do it voluntarily
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.040]   because he knows that this is God's will.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:59.040]   The second negative,
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.040]   he says, not for sordid gain.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:05.040]   Men should never seek the office
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.040]   of a pastor for dishonest gain.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   In other words, money
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   should never be the motive
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   that compels a man to shepherd
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.040]   the Lord's people.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   Yes, a pastor who labors
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   in the word and doctrine,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.040]   a pastor who shepherds the Lord's flock
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.040]   to equip them with the word
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   are worthy of double honor.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   And according to 1 Corinthians
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   chapter 9 verse 14, the Lord
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.040]   directed those who proclaim the gospel
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   to get their living from the gospel.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   However,
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.040]   making money
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.040]   is never the motive of a pastor
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.040]   called to ministry.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.040]   Contrary to all the prosperity
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.040]   preachers, a faithful leader
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.040]   never puts a price on his ministry.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.040]   A pastor
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   should not be greedy for money.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   And we read about this in 1 Timothy
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.040]   chapter 3 verse 3 and also
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.040]   in Titus chapter 1 verse 7.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   A pastor, a faithful pastor
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   never pursues ministry
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   for sordid or dishonest gain.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   He must be honest.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   He must learn to be content
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   in all things.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   He must be thankful in all things
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   knowing that godliness
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   and contentment is great gain.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.040]   It is never the pursuit of money.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   It is the pursuit of Christ
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.040]   and making him known
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   to his people.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   And the
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.040]   third negative which is mentioned in verse 3
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.040]   nor yet as lording it
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.040]   over those allotted to your charge.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   Now the word
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   lording means to dominate.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   It's to dominate someone.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   It's the word describing
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   an oppressive kind of leadership
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   a dominating leadership
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.040]   that seeks power over other people.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   And Peter
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   says don't you ever treat the Lord's people
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.040]   this way. They are his people
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   entrusted to your care
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   and he is not going to tolerate any man
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   who abuses his vested
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.040]   authority to lord it over
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.040]   the Lord's people.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.040]   There is a place
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.040]   for pastoral authority but it's a gentle
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   authority.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   There is no place for oppressive leaders in the church.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   If a man seeks
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.040]   to be a leader in the Lord's church
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   he must be a servant of all.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   Jesus said
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   the rulers of the Gentiles
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   lord it over their people.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   That's what non-believers do
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   but this must not be among us
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   for whoever wishes
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   to become great among us
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.040]   this body of Christ
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   we must be a servant of all.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Jesus himself
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   said I did not come
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   to be served but to serve
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.040]   as a ransom for many.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   We need to model that here.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   So how are pastors
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   to shepherd the Lord's flock?
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   By spiritual oversight.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   Getting the scope of what is
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.040]   and what is to come.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   By being an example to the flock
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   and to have a life of service
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   free from the need for compulsion
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.040]   where someone has to constantly
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   force us to do ministry work.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   Free from greed.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.040]   Free from dominating leadership.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.960]   That's how pastors are to
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   shepherd the Lord's flock.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   And why do we do all of this?
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   If you notice with me finally
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   spiritual leaders
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   are exhorted to
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   shepherd the Lord's flock
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   anticipating the appearing
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   of the chief shepherd.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Notice what Peter says
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   in verse four.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   And when the chief shepherd appears
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   you will receive the unfading
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   crown of glory.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   So why do pastors have to
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.880]   shepherd the Lord's flock?
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   Do we shepherd the Lord's flock
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   to receive praises from men
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   and say good job pastor?
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Do we do it for self-esteem?
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   For personal glory?
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.880]   It's none of those things.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.880]   It is because someday
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   we have to stand before
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.880]   the chief shepherd.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   That's why.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880]   Jesus Christ is the chief shepherd
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   and one day we will have to
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   give our account to him.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.880]   And I always have to
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   remind myself of this truth
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   that one day when he appears
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880]   I will stand before him
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.880]   to give an account
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880]   and all of my intentions
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   all of my motives
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   will be scrutinized
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   by an omniscient judge
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   who knows everything.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   This is why pastors
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   must shepherd the Lord's flock
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   with integrity and virtue.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   Serving as overseers
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.880]   not for possession
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   but voluntarily
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   not for sordid gain
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   but for eagerly
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   not as being lords
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   over the people of God
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880]   but being an example
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   to the flock.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   And so why do pastors do it?
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   And what is it
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   that the pastors have to do?
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.880]   It is because we're compelled
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   by the love of Christ
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   and we are called
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.880]   we're responsible
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880]   to shepherd the flock of God
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880]   who is among us
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   believers entrusted to our care.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.880]   And how are we to shepherd
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   the Lord's flock?
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   Pastors are to shepherd
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.880]   the flock of God
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   by feeding them the word of God
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   and to set an example
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   by modeling the word within.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.880]   And why do pastors do all this?
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   It is because we are compelled
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   by the love of Christ
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.880]   to give an account to the chief shepherd
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   and when the task is done faithfully
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   the promise of scripture
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880]   is that God himself will one day
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   crown us with an unfading
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880]   crown of glory.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.880]   And before I close
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.880]   I need you to understand
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880]   that I chose this specific text
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   praying about it
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   meditating on it
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   and I chose this text
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   not to simply boast in myself
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.880]   and not like other men.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   If any of you know my testimony
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.880]   you know I am an imperfect man
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880]   born with the sin nature
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.880]   like the rest of us.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   I was a rebel
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   I was a rebel
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.880]   filled with malice
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   and hatred for people
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   I am the least of all men
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   and yet the Lord
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880]   was merciful to me
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   a sinner
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   and he saved me by his grace
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.880]   so that in me at the foremost
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   Jesus Christ might demonstrate
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   his perfect patience as an example
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   for those who would believe in him
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   for eternal life.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.880]   You know when comparing myself
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   to other men who have gone astray
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   in their ministry or even the ones
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   that are remaining faithful today
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   I am no different from them
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   in the sense that I share
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   the same fallen nature with them.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   Yes I am justified freely in Christ
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   yes I am being conformed
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.880]   to sanctification yes I am not
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.880]   who I used to be
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   but I will be lying to you today
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   if I said that I no longer struggle
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   with this body of sin and death
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880]   and you know I came to realize
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   that until I am fully redeemed
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   in glory
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   I must run in such a way
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   as the apostle Paul said
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.880]   as not beating the air aimlessly
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.880]   but I discipline my body
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   and I make it my slave
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   so that after I have preached
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.880]   to others I myself
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   will not be disqualified.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   I strive daily
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   to work out my salvation
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.880]   in fear and trembling
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.880]   knowing that it is God
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.880]   who is working in me.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   The reason I share this message
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.880]   with you on my first official day
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880]   is not only for my
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880]   personal introspection
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   but I share this with you
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   as a way to elicit
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.880]   your continued prayers
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   and support for me.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.800]   In addition to the exhortation
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   to pastors and knowing
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   what is expected of me
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   I am humbly asking you
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   the church to keep me accountable
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   but also to pray for me
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   so that I can walk
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   worthy of the call
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   for which God has called me
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   that I do not cause harm
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   and disappointment
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   to the people of God
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   but to be an example
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   to the people of God
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.800]   as the words from your pastor
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   so if you have notes
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   write it down, okay
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   but to repeat the words
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   of Pastor Peter
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   to truly find joy
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   and be thankful
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   not when my pursuits
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   are achieved
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   but because of what I have
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   in Christ Jesus
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   so having said that
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   I ask again
