[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   to us guidance, and thank you, Lord God, that you are not
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.980]   silent, but rather, just as every good parent, you speak to us
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.980]   eloquently, you speak to us closely, you speak to us in ways
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.980]   that we would understand.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.980]   We pray that as we study, you would grant to us the wisdom
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.980]   from above.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:23.980]   Help us, Father God, to have minds that are being renewed,
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.980]   hearts that are being changed, and ultimately, God, we would
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.980]   make decisions in our lives that are honoring to you.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   We thank you.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.980]   It's in Christ's name.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   Amen.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.980]   Okay.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:41.980]   So as a way of review--sorry.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.980]   As a way of review, last time I said prophecy and poetry, it's
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.980]   kind of interesting because prophecy, it comes with an
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   intensity that to a very unique historical circumstance, God is
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:09:00.980]   proclaiming and speaking typically rebuke, typically a
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.980]   kind of wake-up call saying, "You're unfaithful to the
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.980]   covenant promises," and it's God's direct word to his people.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   It's like shouting.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.980]   And then when we read poetry, it's so different because it's
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:16.980]   typically praise and prayer from the people to God.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   It's their expression of love, expression of affection, and
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   it's about the Lord speaking to the generations.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:29.980]   And in that way, there's overlap because the book of Proverbs is
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   also speaking to the generations.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   The book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   The book of Proverbs is a book of observation of the ways of
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.980]   God and the ways of man from one generation to the next.
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.980]   Much of the Scriptures in the book of Proverbs is attributed
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:49.980]   to King Solomon given to his young prince, young man, who
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.980]   needs to learn the instructions of God and heed the instructions
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980]   of his parents.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.980]   Now, these are things that you guys are well aware of, but I
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.980]   want to review because this is where the interpretive mistakes
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.980]   come, okay?
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.980]   The typical mistakes when studying the book of Proverbs is
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.980]   that you get too extreme.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.980]   What do I mean?
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.980]   Well, the book of Proverbs, when you look at the way that it's
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:19.980]   written, the book of Proverbs are truisms versus universal
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.980]   truth that's absolute in every sphere, every situation, and
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.980]   every circumstance, yes?
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.980]   Doctrines about God that he knows all things, that's true no
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:32.980]   matter where you go, no matter what situation, all that kind of
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.980]   stuff, yes?
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   But the reason why I say it's a truism is because you can find
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:39.980]   exception.
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.980]   That's why it's a truism.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   And if you take a moment to think about it, Scripture in the
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.980]   book of Proverbs chapter 21 tells us that those who love
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   righteousness, those who seek love will prosper, yes?
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.980]   But then you read the book of Job.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.980]   Job is a wisdom book.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.980]   And Job says, "I'm the exception.
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.980]   Satan had it out for me.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.980]   God allowed it.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.980]   And I didn't understand.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   As a matter of fact, I was pleading to God, like, 'Tell me
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:09.980]   why.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.980]   What in the world is going on?'"
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.980]   Because the truism is, yes, those who seek righteousness and
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   love, you're generally also loved.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   But there are always exceptions.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.980]   And then point two, it says, "There are norms and not exacting
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.980]   laws or rule because," I said earlier, "the interpretive problem
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.980]   comes when you go extreme."
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.980]   I'll give you an example.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.980]   Proverbs chapter 22 verse 7 says this, "The rich rules over the
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   poor and the borrower becomes a slave to the lender."
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.980]   Have you ever met somebody who has said, "It is a sin to borrow
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.980]   money.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.980]   It is a sin to take out loans.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.980]   There are people who believe that."
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.980]   How would you argue against them?
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.980]   You would tell them, "Pastor Mark said these are norms.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   They're not supposed to be laws.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.980]   We studied law.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.980]   God was very, very exacting.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.980]   If you do this, here are the consequences.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.980]   Here are the stipulations of your relationship with me.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.980]   This is how you walk.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:10.980]   That's law."
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.980]   Proverb is wisdom.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.980]   It's guarding your heart against you constantly taking out loans.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.980]   And, yes, there are people who habitually are in debt.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980]   Are they not?
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.980]   Are they not obligated?
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   And so what you find, actually, that book of Proverbs, just like
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.980]   poetry, uses quite exaggerating or you could say metaphorical
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:35.980]   language to show you the plight, to show you the kind of pains
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.980]   that come from folly.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.980]   And then, obviously, we're thinking about the ways of God
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.980]   and not unconditional promises.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:47.980]   So there are people who read the book of Proverbs like promises.
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.980]   And you could see why I say this because it's important and
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   relevant to the passage we read.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   There are a lot of people who read chapter 3, verses 1 through
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   10 as exacting promises.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:04.980]   If I do this, this is what God has promised me.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.980]   Is that the way you should read it interpretatively?
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.980]   Well, let's continue to discuss that.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.980]   Moving forward, the purposes of the Proverbs is to show you the
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   way and pattern of God and man.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.980]   Some of the Proverbs you'll read and you're kind of like,
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   "That sounds sarcastic," you know?
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.980]   Some of the Proverbs you'll read and you'll read it like,
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   "Is that a good attitude?"
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.980]   Well, our expectation shouldn't be every verse comes from the
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.980]   holiest, most godliest perspective, but rather the point
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   wasn't that.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.980]   It wasn't to teach you a moral.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.980]   It was to show you how life is.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.980]   Does that make sense?
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:47.980]   Sometimes it's to show you the observation of the person giving
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.980]   Proverbs, like this is the way the world works, okay?
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.980]   All right, that being said, the purpose of Proverbs is to make
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.980]   us wise in our thinking, wise in our hearts, and ultimately wise
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.980]   in our character so that we are spared all the pains and all the
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.980]   snares that the generations before us have experienced, okay?
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   So when we think about this, I want to say as a reaction, as a
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.980]   first kind of instinctual reaction to the book of Proverbs,
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.980]   everything I just said now I hope you didn't take as to mean,
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.980]   so therefore, you know, don't take it so seriously.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   I hope you didn't think I was going to say that, right?
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.980]   The book of Proverbs is wisdom sayings and it's observations.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.980]   Therefore, don't take it too seriously.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.980]   The exact opposite, okay?
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:44.980]   The book of Proverbs still is the wisdom from above, and the
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   Scripture says in Proverbs 4, verse 7, "The beginning of wisdom
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.980]   is this, acquire wisdom.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.980]   And with all your acquiring, get understanding."
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   The book of Proverbs we should see as this is the most practical.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.980]   This is the most applicational book of the Old Testament, right?
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.980]   This touches upon every single practical element of my life,
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:14.980]   including my money, my time, my mouth, my lust, my desires, my
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:15.980]   ambitions, my work.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   It touches everything.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.980]   And so the way we should be thinking about this book is I
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.980]   want as much of it as I can.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.980]   As a matter of fact, you know the book of Proverbs, it says,
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.980]   "Guard the truth and the wisdom that God gives you.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.980]   Guard the instruction like it's your life."
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.980]   We should be hungry for it, okay?
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:40.980]   And therefore, a kind of approach, whereas with epistles,
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   it's so still important that we take a look at every verse and
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   we dissect it.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.980]   We start chopping it up into little segments, and we follow
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   the flow of thought and all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   With the book of Proverbs, you know that we should be
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.980]   meditating.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   We should be thinking application.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:03.980]   If you read the Bible and you don't do application, a lot of
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.980]   times people have said, "Then all you've done is think about
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   stuff and lofty concept, and then it dies," right?
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.980]   Well, the book of Proverbs says, "If you do that, you're a fool."
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.980]   Why?
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.980]   Wise living has to do with your skill, your skill of how you
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.980]   made decisions, your skill of how you matured, ultimately how
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   you changed.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   And so, leaning heavy, the tip that I gave you in studying the
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   book of Proverbs is the book of Proverbs actually is incredibly
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:34.980]   repetitive.
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.980]   What you saw in chapter 3, you will see all through chapter 4,
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.980]   right?
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.980]   What you saw in chapter 4, you will see all through chapter 6.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.980]   So, it's super repetitive.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   The question is, "Are you meditating deeply on this text?"
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   Now, as a quick--another introductory remark on this,
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   what is then meditation and how are we thinking through what
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.980]   meditation is?
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.980]   Well, as the book of Proverbs typically has like one-line
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.980]   zingers and sometimes they'll have big block paragraphs, but
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:08.980]   they're truth bombs.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.980]   It lands super heavy because it sometimes, in such a succinct
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   way, identifies your problem, that kind of thing, right?
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.980]   We want to make sure we're meditating very deeply.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.980]   And the Hebrew term for meditate is not just to think deeply but
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   to recite, to mutter, and to murmur it.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   You're kind of like retelling, retelling, retelling so that it
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   is ruminating in your mind.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   What's more, in the Greek, it says to pay special attention,
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   to attend to it carefully, to contemplate it deeply, and then
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.980]   to put it to practice, right?
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   Essentially, you're taking this truth and you're testing it
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   here, testing it there, testing it here, testing it there.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Does it fit here?
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   Does it fit there?
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   Does it fit here?
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.980]   And that's the kind of picture I want you to have with Proverbs.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   You want to kind of see actually--I word it funny in the
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.980]   document that I gave as a tip, which is like lean heavy on
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.980]   meditation and observation of the world, okay, meaning you
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   should be looking at even people.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.980]   The Scripture says things like, "Do not speak in the presence
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.980]   of fools for when he hears your wisdom, he will scoff at you."
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.980]   Well, is that guy a fool?
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.980]   Is this guy--I'm just kidding.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:27.980]   Sorry.
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:31.980]   Anyway, you should be taking that to test.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:32.980]   Does this apply here?
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   Does this apply there?
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.980]   And then obviously, once you look at the world and wonder in
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   what situations and circumstances apply, you're looking at
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   yourself, "Am I the fool?"
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.980]   Okay?
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.980]   What's in my heart?
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.980]   This is the kind of way that we should be approaching Proverbs.
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.980]   Taking a look at our passage.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.980]   Jumping now to this segment.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   "My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   keep my commandments for the length of days and years of life
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   and peace they will add to you."
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.980]   Okay.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.980]   When I put it like this, I hope you guys in the back can see it.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.980]   You guys can immediately appreciate the kind of pattern, right?
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   The kind of pattern that you see.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:21.980]   Do you guys remember what kind of literary device this is?
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.980]   Anyone?
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.980]   Did I hear synonymous parallelism?
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:26.980]   Very good.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   Okay.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   That's what that is.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   Okay.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.980]   You have two lines that are saying the exact same thing
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.980]   in different words.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.980]   And you see it.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.980]   The first is correction.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:36.980]   Don't do this.
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:37.980]   Don't forget.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   Don't let the truth leave you.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   And then the exhortation, bind them around your neck.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   Write them on the tablet of your heart.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.980]   And then the blessings, okay?
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.980]   And so when you see this, I would see it as one unit.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.980]   So if I was making the outline of the text for today,
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:55.980]   verses 1 through 10, I would split it right there at verse 4
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   and say this is one thought at the beginning,
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.980]   and then the next thought has more to do with the trust
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   and the honor and the acknowledging of God, right?
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:03.980]   Okay.
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:07.980]   So when we look at this, I want you guys to do this.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.980]   Remember that whenever we're doing then this kind of parallelism,
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   he's obviously using that for you to, yes, meditate.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   You do one run-through, and then you do another.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.980]   So then I ask you, how would you summarize into one singular concept
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   what this passage is saying?
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   Any volunteers?
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980]   Should I call on this table?
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   Sorry.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:35.980]   I just like to see you guys squirm and have your eyes avoid contact with me.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:36.980]   Okay.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   The idea is just simply keep the commandments, right?
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.980]   God could have just said that.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.980]   The Father could have just said that, right?
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.980]   Giving instructions like, "Dude, have you seen the Old Testament?
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.980]   Just obey," you know?
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:55.980]   That could have been the word because that's the wise word to say.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:59.980]   But why does it have all of these different devices,
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.980]   and why does it have all these different elements to it?
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.980]   Well, for us to just take a moment to meditate together on this,
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:10.980]   did you observe--I hope you did--not only the parallelism,
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.980]   but this whole negative and positive command,
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.980]   which is a device to focus you in and hone you in.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   And I get this picture because if any of you have ever given instructions to a child,
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.980]   and you tell them, "Hey, you glue it like this,"
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   and then you realize they don't understand, so you have to say, "Not like that," right?
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   And so you get humbled to realize you are that child.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   Well, let me take a moment to just meditate with you.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:43.980]   By thinking about the negative part of the command, it says, "Do not forget."
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:48.980]   And what's more, "Do not let kindness and truth leave you."
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.980]   And the first thing I thought as I reflected on myself is,
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:57.980]   "Dude, I am like the most forgetful person in this church."
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   I am.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:03.980]   Did you know that there was a time someone wanted to borrow a book off my shelf
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.980]   and asked me, "Oh, shoot, did you read this? It looks good."
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   And I said, "No, I never read that."
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.980]   And they opened it and said, "How come your pen mark and notes are all over it?"
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:14.980]   And I said, "Oh, shoot, I read that."
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.980]   I'm one of the most forgetful people I know.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.980]   And then he says, "But don't allow that to happen."
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.980]   There is such also a passive nature to who I am, isn't there?
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.980]   All of us.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   I imagine maybe if you put this into some kind of other scenario
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.980]   where the son is telling the father, "Oh, Father, she left me."
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:41.980]   And the father rebukes the son and says, "No, you let her go.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.980]   It's your fault.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   You were supposed to cling to her.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.980]   You were supposed to cling to truth."
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.980]   The natural propensity of my mind and my heart is I get so distracted.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   I get so lost in my own thoughts.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.980]   And as the days go by, I always tend to forget.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:08.980]   And God has told us you have to cling to it like your life depends on it.
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.980]   You have to exert that energy to keep it near you.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:17.980]   Why is it that sometimes we just assume if I just sit back and listen to sermons,
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:19.980]   I'll be good?
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.980]   That's on us.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:27.980]   And so when this passage commands us to bind these truths on our necks
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.980]   and write them on our hearts, question to you, how will you apply that?
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   How will you make application so for those of you who are just as forgetful as I am
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   to not just simply allow your months, your years to go by?
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.980]   And it's kind of like even with young children in the spouse ministry.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   Actually, the parents are awesome because they take home the assignments and the papers
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.980]   and they'll always ask the student, "What did you learn?"
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.980]   And you guys know what happens.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.980]   I don't know.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.980]   How will you as a mature adult prevent that from happening?
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:04.980]   How will you as an adult prevent the truth from just leaving you?
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.980]   And how will you apply?
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.980]   Yes, it's metaphorical, the binding on your neck and the writing on your heart.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   How will you apply that?
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:17.980]   So obviously, that's a strong push in the text, and we have to meditate on it.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.980]   The next portion, the next portion from verse 5 through 10.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:27.980]   We're not obviously going to get to go through everything, but you see such a pattern again.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:34.980]   Once you break it down into the poetic form and you start to do things like kind of indent segments,
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.980]   and you guys see my rationale into the indentation.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   In the previous section, it was the negative command, "Don't."
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.980]   Then it was the exhortation command, "Do this, keep it."
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.980]   And then it was the motivation or the blessing.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:56.980]   Likewise here, once you see that pattern, you realize, "Wow, this author is clearly building the whole thing
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:58.980]   in two verses each."
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean out on your understanding, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:09.980]   One of the things that I ask you guys to do is whenever you see so many instructive words,
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.980]   you have to make a list, and you have to identify all of them.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.980]   Not all the Proverbs are like this.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.980]   Some of the Proverbs are like storytelling.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   Chapter 7, it's like, "Don't go near the crazy lady who's flirtatious, and her husband's gone,
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.980]   and she's going to say all this stuff."
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   The command doesn't come until the end of the story.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   It's like, "And if you go there, you're stupid."
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   It's like a long story.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   Not all the Proverbs are like this, where it's just like, bam, bam, bam, instruction and command.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:42.980]   When you see that, you have to be a good student and just list all of it.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:46.980]   And then think, what are these commands pushing?
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:52.980]   Is there a one singular emphatic command of these list of commands?
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:56.980]   Is there a rhyme or reason as you work through these commands?
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:01.980]   And so clearly, for me, I just started underlining, and I'm sure you guys did too,
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.980]   this idea is like, "Trust in the Lord.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   Do not lean on your understanding.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.980]   Acknowledge Him.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.980]   Don't be wise in your eyes.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   Fear Him.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   Honor the Lord."
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:18.980]   And I'm not going to, for the sake of time, dive into this is what I think the progression is,
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:26.980]   but clearly there's this mounting weight of how we are to give our full confidence to God
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:33.980]   and entrust ourselves in such a way where we go from before just passively listening to the words
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.980]   and it just floats away, to now I'm filled with worship,
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   to now where I'm proactively taking my first fruits and giving them to God.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   Why?
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:48.980]   Because this individual who is receiving the instruction is maturing.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:53.980]   But as you see the weight of the instructions, you also see the weight of the blessing.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:27:00.980]   The equal parts are these are the commands, and then here are all the blessings.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:06.980]   So just like we did with circling the commands and identifying and listing them,
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.980]   we should list off all the blessings because they're quite profound.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.980]   And we should ask the same questions.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:19.980]   Is there any one of these blessings that stand out as an emphatic top blessing out of all the others?
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:23.980]   Is there kind of a cohesive way to think about all these blessings?
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:30.980]   One way to think about it is, man, in trusting God, you get everything.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.980]   You get the longevity.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:34.980]   You get the favor.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   You get the direction, the clarity, the guidance, the straight and narrow path.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:43.980]   You get the healing, the internal peace, and you get the abundance.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:48.980]   That's everything good you could possibly think of.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.980]   There is total security in trusting God.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   But here is the interpretive question.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.980]   Why?
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:04.980]   Because remember how I said that the interpretive error that comes from studying Proverbs is when you take the extreme.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   Who does this?
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.980]   Prosperity Gospel Preachers takes the extreme on this specific text.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   A long, long time ago, right after I graduated seminary, for some reason, when I had some time, I watched Prosperity Gospel Preachers.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   And part of it was for fun because it was hilarious.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   Other parts of it was, you know, I preach against it heavy.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:29.980]   I should at least listen to some of them.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:35.980]   And it's wild because people like Joel Osteen, they'll actually say, "Everybody take your Bible."
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:38.980]   And they'll take it and they'll say, "I believe everything it says."
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.980]   And then they'll chant after him, "I believe everything it says.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.980]   I believe everything it says about God.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:45.980]   I believe everything it says about me."
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.980]   And that's the stuff they say.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.980]   And you're like, "Whoa, that's the same stuff I would say."
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   And then they would open up to, I remember Joel Osteen specifically opening up to this text and saying,
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:02.980]   "You have to trust God with everything and with your whole heart completely, not just with some things."
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.980]   And you're just like, "Are you crazy?
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.980]   That's what I would say."
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.980]   Until you get to this point where you realize.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:16.980]   But then he says, "But in you giving yourself and surrendering to God, he will honor you."
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:22.980]   And then you realize, "Wow, this guy is so good at little pithy statements."
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.980]   These prosperity gospels are amazing at these one-liners, "Honor God, he'll honor you.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:30.980]   Let go, let God," and all this kind of stuff.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   And it's so catchy.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.980]   And I realize that's how people get duped.
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:39.980]   It sounds so much like Proverbs.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   It sounds so wise.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   So how would you respond to that?
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:46.980]   And I'm guessing you will actually run into somebody who maybe is discontent.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   It's like, "I've been faithful.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.980]   I've been faithful to God.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:56.980]   But I'm struggling so much, and I'm always stuck."
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.980]   They'll ask you, "What gives?
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.980]   What's up with Proverbs 3 1-10?"
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   I mean, the weight of blessing and promise is so heavy.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   So the question is, to what extent can we hope for earthly blessings and prosperity as we live faithfully?
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   Well, one extreme on the suffering side is someone might be like, "No."
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:21.980]   2 Timothy says, "Anybody who lives a godly life will be persecuted."
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:23.980]   Expect nothing but suffering.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   You're supposed to expect nothing.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   And basically, all your blessings are only in eternity when you die and leave this world.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   Is that what you believe?
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   Or do you lean kind of like, "Well, it does say you'll be blessed."
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:50.980]   Because we don't have time to go over everything, all I'm going to say is this.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   Obviously, I gave earlier the principle that the wisdom literature is not to be taken as a universal promise or laws of God,
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.980]   but that it's a way of God or pattern of life.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:06.980]   And I hope that when you're counseling somebody, don't say it like this.
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:12.980]   Don't be like, "Pastor Mark said that wisdom literature is not like that."
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   But rather, give the kind of hope that says, "You know, the scripture is always right and true.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:25.980]   The best, most glorious, the most blessed way is to trust God."
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.980]   I 100% believe it.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   The scripture tells us that our eyes might not see it that way.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.980]   Your body may not feel like that, correct?
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:44.980]   But 1,000% I believe when God says your inner peace, when God says your overall health, your inner bones,
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:51.980]   when God says your prosperity, all of that is in the sovereign hand of God and you need to trust him.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   That's true.
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:54.980]   It is.
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.980]   I believe it.
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:08.980]   But just one more thought though is in the immediate context in our paragraph, in the context of the rest of Proverbs,
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:15.980]   and in the context of the whole Bible, we know the prosperity gospel is just idolatry, right?
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:23.980]   Because here, just in looking at the text that we have, what is the emphatic responsibility for me?
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:29.980]   The emphatic responsibility for me is to just trust God.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:35.980]   Trust him to the degree where I know that he's going to be true and faithful and I need to just honor him.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:39.980]   The rest of that is just God's responsibility, right?
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.980]   That's the immediate context.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:51.980]   But also, in the context of the rest of Proverbs, scripture teaches us, "Do not weary yourself to gain wealth.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:54.980]   Cease from your consideration of it.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.980]   When you set your eyes on it, it is gone.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:03.980]   For wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that flies toward the heavens."
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.980]   Okay?
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:12.980]   So I hope that that's kind of--I know nobody in here believes like prosperity gospel is true.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:13.980]   Yeah, you know.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:19.980]   But will you run across some people who are kind of wondering like, "Man, I'm so stuck in life.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.980]   Where are the answers?"
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:24.980]   And they remember singing Proverbs chapter 3.
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:29.980]   They remember hearing Proverbs chapter 3 because it's one of the most famous passages in the book of Proverbs.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:30.980]   Yes?
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   And they say, "Where is this?
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   Where is this promise of God?
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:34.980]   What will you say?"
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   Right?
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.980]   "What will you say?"
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:45.980]   And my encouragement is I hope we can, just from the study, realize the admonition for us to meditate deeply,
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:54.980]   not on just simply the out-product of life, but rather meditating deeply on the call that's emphatic in the text.
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.980]   I skipped over the slide.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:03.980]   Right there in the middle where it tells us to trust in the Lord and to lean not on our own understanding.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   Yes?
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:12.980]   The whole segment that we're looking at, it actually points to it, that one line.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   You guys don't have to exactly know what a chiastic structure is, and you guys don't have to like, "Oh, is it here?
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:19.980]   Is it there?"
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   All that kind of stuff.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   Sometimes it pops out at you, and sometimes it doesn't, you know?
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:34.980]   But nevertheless, identifying these key literary devices helps us understand when it comes to our responsibility to live skillfully,
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   the passage is telling us we have to trust the Lord with everything we've got.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.980]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:54.980]   Again, we thank you because when we meditated this past week during Passion Week, Lord,
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:35:03.980]   we know, Father God, that above and beyond just food for the day, above and beyond overthrowing the government
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:09.980]   or having our life so secure, you gave us yourself.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.980]   You gave us, Father God, access to you, so thank you.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:17.980]   Here in Proverbs, we hear the same thing.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.980]   God, we may be in despair.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.980]   We may be poor.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:27.980]   We may be in need of daily bread, but you call us to trust you with everything we've got.
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.980]   And I pray, Father God, that we would heed this wisdom.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:39.980]   I pray, Father Lord, that we would also experience it, that we would experience the joys where we no longer trust our own might or our power,
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.980]   but that we trust you.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:41.980]   We thank you.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:42.980]   It's in Christ's name.
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.980]   Amen.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.980]   Okay.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:57.980]   So over here, next week is our last Lesson 10, and we're going to be studying Revelation Chapter 5, 1 through 14, okay?
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:04.980]   The handout is—you don't have to, like, read in detail everything because it's going to be just a resource for you.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.980]   I summarized.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:15.980]   Here are the general principles of biblical hermeneutics that follows our historical, literal, grammatical way of interpreting things,
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:22.980]   and then also genre-specific hermeneutic rules, okay?
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:23.980]   Oh, no.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:26.980]   What happened?
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:27.980]   Okay.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   You know what?
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   My discussion questions didn't update, so your small group leader should have them.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:42.980]   I'm going to try my best to put this up here and put it on, but you guys can go ahead and go into your discussion time to discuss application, okay?
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.980]   Thanks, everyone.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:45.980]   Thank you.
