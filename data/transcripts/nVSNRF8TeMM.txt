[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:08.540]   Okay. Also, as the Passion Week is approaching, it is a really opportune time to evangelize to
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:16.960]   our friends and family. We will be hosting a Cafe Gospel Night on April 12th. That's a Saturday at
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:24.340]   7 p.m. here in the Fellowship Hall. Okay. This evening will include both some musical presentations,
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:31.820]   refreshments, etc., but we will be presenting the gospel in proper form and at length. So please
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:38.240]   invite, you know, your non-believing co-workers or friends, and then please do sign up. If you want to

[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.580]   prayer, you can put your, you know, name in, who you hope to invite, and you can put some details down so
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:57.940]   that we can lift them up by name in prayer. Also, I want to highlight our Passover meal. Please make
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:05.160]   sure if you have not participated in that, sign up for it. For those of you guys who have participated,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:11.520]   you still can. It's not only exclusive to those, but we did mention that the space is limited because
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.320]   we're going to be hosting it in here, and we do have to make a special table arrangements. So please make
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.000]   sure to sign up for that early as possible. As the week approaches, we've been mentioning that we do
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   need volunteers. So actually, as the QR code is up there, if you're available and can lend a hand,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:35.560]   please go ahead and do that now. We do need volunteers to help with food prep on Saturday and Sunday. That's
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.140]   a kind of a highlight area because, you know, we really want to have that fellowship time together
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.740]   as a church, and it is quite the undertaking and big endeavor. So please make sure to volunteer for
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:52.500]   that if you have time. Another highlight is that kind of spring cleaning, cleaning and maintenance day
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.220]   is going to be coming up Saturday, April 26th. So just mark your calendars for that. You know,
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.640]   save the QR code and link for that to help serve and lend a hand in cleaning up the whole church facility.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.400]   The final thing is, for those of you guys who are newer to the church, we are going to be starting a new membership
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   class. This class is going to take place starting from April 27th at 9 30 a.m., and it will run for eight weeks.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.940]   So as you're here, and if you are thinking about committing to the church, you know, that class is a mandatory one
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:29.240]   for our membership process, and it'll cover all the core doctrines and also philosophy of ministry for the church.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:35.360]   So please make sure to sign up for that. Okay, then I would like to switch it over to some of the pre-discussion
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:42.520]   questions. As we hit, you know, some of the more, I guess you could say, difficult passages, whether it's the
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.980]   prophecies, then we're going to go into Psalms, and then we'll do Proverbs and Revelations. There's a few weeks
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:55.380]   left. Please know that all the normal inductive study methods you apply, it still is going to glean for you
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.020]   these various observations, and you can just share that and the questions you have. But specifically for
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:08.520]   this, I asked if you can discuss, because, you know, kind of the nature of the chapter we read was so
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.340]   intense, talk about the tone, talk about, you know, the repeated idea, and where is the emphasis in the
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:21.620]   chapter, etc. But also, number three, make observations and detailed questions about what's the difference
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:27.500]   as a comparison of the covenant of old and a new covenant of promise. Okay? So go ahead and take some
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.560]   time to discuss. At eight o'clock, we'll be back for teaching time. Thanks.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.440]   Thank you.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Thank you.

[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:26.260]   Thank you.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:56.240]   Thank you.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:26.220]   Thank you.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:56.200]   Thank you.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:26.180]   You're in the book.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:56.160]   of text of text.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:26.140]   And you're in the book,
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:56.120]   And you're in the book,
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:03.340]   chapter 29 to chapter 33, embedded into the heart of Jeremiah, is a beautiful segment on God's mercy
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:10.180]   and future plans for the nation of Israel, okay? However, how many of you guys have heard this one?
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:17.660]   It says, this whole land will be a desolation, a horror, and these nations will serve the kings of
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:25.080]   Babylon 70 years. My guess is none of you guys have that placard on the wall or memorized on the tip
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:35.200]   of your tongues because obviously the tone is so different, okay? So when we study the books of
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:41.180]   prophecy, part of the reason why I mentioned this idea of you have to know the tone is because the
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:50.840]   book has a movement that's typically incredibly forceful. Why? If you imagine, do you remember a
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:56.600]   couple sessions ago, I said, imagine you're at the pool and you're the lifeguard, and you see all
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.200]   these kids running around and jumping off where they shouldn't be jumping off and nose diving into
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.500]   stuff and crack their head, right? What would you do? And I talked about a meme where this young girl
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:14.320]   who's a lifeguard just starts screaming, walk, right? Well, I use that analogy again to say, if you imagine
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:20.980]   the nation of Israel just disobeying every rule there is around the pool, running amok and doing
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:27.860]   whatever they want, the book of prophecies are often actually interjections of God speaking to his
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:36.200]   people. Listen, you keep doing that, you're going to crack your head. So a lot of the tones of the
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.480]   prophets are something that we have to look out for, and specifically for our book in Jeremiah,
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.840]   Jeremiah, it is heavily confrontational, it's incredibly urgent, and it's pleading for repentance,
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:54.820]   it's deeply sorrowful and mournful, and what's more, the emotions are so intense that there is this
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:02.000]   poetic repetition that you guys have already seen in our chapter, but on almost every major movement of
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.900]   this whole book, there is intense emotion through it all. For example, look at what Jeremiah says in 9.1,
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:15.920]   Oh, that my head were waters, my eyes were fountains of tears, that I may weep day and night for the slain
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:25.840]   of the daughter of my people. My soul, my soul, I'm in anguish. This is the tone of the whole book, okay?
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:31.480]   The whole book is just repeat of this, and that's why a lot of people, I think, when they read prophecy,
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:38.860]   they kind of start moving away from reading it. I mean, who wants to read, like, you have to read 29
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.340]   chapters, an incredible rebuke to get to a beautiful passage like this, right? It can be difficult. But
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:54.140]   coming to just a quick hermeneutical rule again is this. When we read prophecy, you should interpret it
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:15:01.520]   as a literal proclamation with a very clear intended message. It's typically a rebuke, call to repentance,
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:09.460]   a warning, or a word of hope with elements of foretelling of future events. Let me take a moment
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:16.560]   to pause there. Why am I saying this rule? Because if I summarize that, it just says, read it literally.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:25.160]   That's it, okay? It's because the common kind of mistake, the common error in looking at prophetic
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:32.020]   books is you think that there are weird mystical sayings about the future, strange oracles and
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:38.860]   visions, and weird kind of drama. And yes, the book of Jeremiah has tons of them. I believe there are seven
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:44.820]   movements of different pictures. The reason why earlier I gave you the photo of this is because God made
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:51.260]   Jeremiah take these jars. And he said, take them. And in front of everybody, start crushing them on the
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:58.780]   floor. But is that like very difficult to understand? Is that so difficult to interpret? The answer is no.
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:05.660]   There is a clear message behind that. Whether it's you're not listening to me, I have to get your
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:13.620]   attention, that kind of stuff, okay? So my point in this is, please do not first and foremost look at
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:20.100]   prophets like difficult fortune telling or foretelling of the future that we'll never know because we're
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:27.220]   not supposed to know the times or specifically when. And that's true. If you keep asking, when is this?
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.580]   When is this? You're coming at it with an expectation where you're not going to get the answer. But if you're
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:41.520]   coming at it with what is God's word to these people in their moment, it's not only clear, it's so abundantly
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:47.680]   clear. There's drama presentations, reiterations and explanations for them to get the clear message.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:55.920]   Okay? All right. With that said, I'm still on this idea of what's the tone? Okay? What is the tone?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.240]   And for us, understanding the tone of the whole book makes us even appreciate more.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:10.820]   How in the world do we jump from, like, you people are not listening to me, like, judgment's coming for
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:16.740]   you, to this, where God says in Jeremiah 31, I asked you guys to read the whole chapter,
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.360]   where he begins by saying, "The Lord appeared to him from afar, saying, 'I have loved you with an everlasting
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.840]   love. Therefore, I have drawn you with loving kindness. Again, I will build you and you will be rebuilt,
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:35.360]   O virgin of Israel. Again, you will take up your tambourines and go forth to the dances of the merry
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:44.320]   merry-makers.'" Okay? So in this sense, if we had time, we'd camp out. And my exhortation to you is,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.680]   rather than looking at the book of prophets like, "Oh, those are really difficult books about the future,"
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:56.160]   rather look at them as incredibly, emotionally intense moments of proclamation.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:03.200]   And you're supposed to feel it. You're supposed to feel this emotion. Chapter 31 is very repetitive,
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:10.400]   isn't it? The terms of God's love, His kindness, His desire to rebuild, the way that He addresses
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:17.280]   Israel, and keep this in mind that He's referring to them as a virgin. Okay? It's actually so repetitive.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.720]   If you read the prophets and you come across repetitions of God's judgment and His wrath,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.920]   you're supposed to feel it. And if you hit moments like this, when we're talking about His word of hope
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.440]   for the people, you have to feel it. Okay? So that would be kind of like the first reading of the text.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:43.200]   And then you do a second reading, walking through, and I ask you guys to try and outline chapter 31 if
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:52.880]   possible, and for sure try to outline our paragraph, verse 27 through 37. Okay? Remember, I love outlines.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.880]   If you did an outline for today, did you really prepare for today? Did you really do a Bible study?
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:09.040]   The outline process makes you identify where are the thoughts leading to? Okay? What is God's point?
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:15.280]   It helps you break up this huge chunk in paragraph and say, "Where are the identifiable pieces?" So,
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:22.000]   let's do a walk through together. In the second reading, thinking through, "What are the promises of God?" If this whole
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:31.520]   tone is, like, essentially, everlasting love and restoration. If the whole tone is love and mercy,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.120]   what are the promises of God? Here, you will notice that he has this repeated little phrase where it
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:45.840]   says, "Days are coming. Behold the days." Right? And it already kind of tells you the outline. So, in our
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:52.960]   paragraph from verse 27 to 28, I notice here that he says, "I'm going to sow the house of Israel," and then he
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.680]   explains it. "Just as I watched them and I plucked them and broke them, then I'm going to bring, and to
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:06.800]   bring disaster. So, I'll watch over them to build and to plant." First promise, future replanting and
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:14.560]   rebuilding of Israel and Judah. Right? I'm sure you guys all got that. The next outline point would be,
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:21.440]   he says in verse 29, "In those days," and he describes how before the fathers ate the sour grapes and the
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:27.840]   children felt it. And then here he says, "But each man who eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will be set
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:36.240]   on edge." So, what we notice is, he says, "In the future days, it's not going to be where one man sins and
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:43.440]   everybody gets judged." Right? It says, "Individual responsibility and consequences." Then, verse 31 through 34,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:51.760]   here is the crux of our paragraph and such a beautiful promise of God. "Days are coming," he says, "I will make
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:58.720]   a new covenant." And here you should have all kinds of questions, right? Even though, yes, maybe immediately
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:04.560]   all your New Testament passages start coming in and all your theology about how did Jesus fulfill this for
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.240]   our sake. I'm going to leave that to you to discuss and to just think about, but we're just going to think
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:18.000]   about it here. It's like, how would the people here, like in this moment, hear this? They've been just
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.480]   told like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe how much of a sinner you are. You have any idea how upset God
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:29.440]   is with you?" Et cetera, et cetera, right? And then to hear, "God is going to make this new covenant with you."
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:38.320]   And then, in the second part of that, from verse 33 to 34, he gives the details, and then I'm going to
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   give you this portion as just kind of like my summary of what are the promises of this new covenant. And I'm
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:51.280]   sure you guys identify them as God saying that I'm going to internally transform you, that I will put
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:59.200]   my law in their heart. That there's going to be a personal, private knowledge of God. At that time,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.320]   they're going to know me. It's going to be so sweet. We don't have to do this like, "Do you understand? Do you
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.760]   understand?" and speak to each other like somebody doesn't know. And what's more, there's going to be
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:16.960]   forgiveness. A kind of forgiveness where God says, "I will not remember your sins." Amazing, right?
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:26.880]   My admonition to you is, if again, you thought that the book of prophecy was incredibly difficult,
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:34.240]   "Oh, I'm not a scholar. I can't study the prophets." If that's you, please know like this doesn't take like
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.720]   a degree to just identify. Let me just break it down. What is he promising us?
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.360]   And when we do that, we realize not only is it just simple, he's reiterating them in so many
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:52.960]   different ways. And then finally, in the last segment, okay, in Jeremiah 31:35-37, he starts
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:59.280]   speaking in such beautiful terms. So long as there is sun fixed order, so long as you're not able to
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.480]   measure the heavens or the foundations of the earth, so long as that's the case, I will never cut off Israel.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:15.920]   This is a promise that God is not going to be done with them, right? Such assurance, such security.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:21.920]   So, the reason why I say this is because again, in your reading through the prophets,
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:31.440]   there's a sentiment where it's easy, okay? There's a sentiment in which your identification of what his
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:38.800]   promises are should highlight those very things God wants to emphasize, okay? I'm going to give you guys
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:45.440]   kind of like a couple quick notes again, which is this. I want you guys, as good students of the
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.400]   scripture, to know that there is something kind of plain about studying the scriptures, and it's you
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:58.640]   being safe. What I mean by that is, what it literally says, allow it to just say, okay? If he starts
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:05.440]   talking about, I'm going to, you know, give the, this nation all these boundaries, go ahead and just
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.920]   think like, that's what he's going to do. If he says, I'm going to raise up this individual and cause
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.520]   him to resurrect, then obviously you're going to be like, that's the guy. If there's a forerunner for
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.320]   Jesus, then he's going to be there. Whatever the passage literally says, you can take as like,
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:24.400]   unless the scripture says otherwise, unless in the context it says otherwise, I'm just going to take
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.640]   it at face value. Okay. The reason why I say this is because, for example,
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:38.160]   part of the reason why I think sometimes people are fearful of prophecy
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:46.400]   is because there has been so much historically, even like, even though maybe we're, we're not like
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.440]   accustomed to it here, just across the board, there has been a kind of tendency to, to,
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:58.400]   to study the passage allegorically. What do I mean by this? In our passage in verse 27, to us, it says,
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.080]   when I will sow, oh, sorry, behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:11.840]   on the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beasts. Okay. The typical immediate
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.440]   question is, what does that mean for me? And so did you know that even individuals like John Calvin,
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.920]   if you guys go and use your, you know, BibleStudyTools.com, etc., there's a commentary by Matthew Henry.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:31.600]   These individuals made direct correlation from these passages, this text, to us. So if you look up this
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:38.160]   text in their commentary, they'll say, the sowing of Israel is like our modern-day evangelism. God has
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:45.680]   so desired the seed to go forth and to multiply, and that is the work of evangelism. Whoa. That's a huge
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.480]   jump, isn't it? But if you go to prophecy and you keep wondering, like, what does that mean for me? What
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.120]   does that mean for me? You get into error that way. What's more, the seed of beasts, they'll describe as
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.400]   this means the prosperity of the Christian nations. When the scripture is being used to develop, like,
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.200]   the political system, when the scripture is being used to develop the land, there's even going to be
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.160]   prosperity, and that's what he means by the seed of beasts being there as well and being replanted.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:21.120]   In some sense, that sounds nice, but is that what he's saying? No. He explains himself. Verse 27,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   verse 28, that as he's watched over the nation of Israel, he's going to watch over them and replant
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:38.160]   them. Right? Okay. So I want to just kind of highlight for you guys and do a quick pop quiz, right?
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.880]   Here, the way that we've been studying the biblical hermeneutics, we said that there is a literal
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:55.120]   HG hermeneutic. The H stands for historical. Thank you. And the G stands for
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:03.840]   grammatical. You all fail. Anyway, I'm kidding. Okay. It's a literal historical grammatical hermeneutic.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:10.160]   Okay? That's the way that we're trying to read the passage. Yes, there's a prophet speaking to the
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.600]   people, but what he's saying is actually literal. Now, what's interesting is people who practice
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.920]   allegorical, like, interpretation will accuse us and say, "Are you saying it's literal? Like,
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.600]   God is literally going to take the nation and plant them?" It's like, no. When we say literal,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.440]   we mean we take the figures of speech that God employs and uses, and then we take their meaning
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:41.040]   literally. What we don't do is make huge jumps to spiritualize those texts. Okay? So I know I kind
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.760]   of went long there, but I just want you to know, again, one of the primary kind of common errors of
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.960]   studying prophecy and making it difficult is to think, like, what does this mean for me? How does this apply
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:58.400]   now? Et cetera, et cetera. And that makes it tough. Moving forward, we said first reading, pay attention
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:05.600]   to the tone because it's such an intensely emotional text. Second reading, pay attention to the details of
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:13.520]   future promise. And don't just make huge jumps to, "That's me. That's me. That's me." Okay? Third reading,
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:21.200]   we want to talk about the historical context. And what is the covenant context? You guys looked at,
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.960]   he has reference to the previous covenant and the immediate covenant. And what I want to say is,
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.280]   okay, so if we see that, we have to give attention to the historical context.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:38.960]   Just a quick note is this: Jeremiah is speaking to a people who are already being taken captive.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:49.280]   Starting from 605 BC down to 586 BC, this is the time where God's judgment is being carried out by the
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:56.160]   nation of Babylon. Babylon's growing in their power. Assyria is already diminishing. And there's waves of
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:03.360]   people being deported and taken captive. Ultimately, coming down to 586, where Judah becomes destroyed
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.920]   utterly. Okay? This kind of information, it would be difficult just to pick up from reading the book.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.720]   But you can actually pick it up as you read it. My recommendation is, again, whenever you're
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.240]   studying the Bible, go ahead and take a look at your study Bible. Just do a quick search on context,
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:27.920]   historical context of the book, and you'll realize that this text that we're reading is given to people
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.440]   who are already suffering the consequences of their sin. Take a moment to think about that.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.120]   Take a moment to think about that and how you appreciate this text. Okay? Now,
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:46.720]   earlier I mentioned that you guys took a look at this and he said that God, or in this passage,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.280]   Jeremiah highlighted the difference between the old covenant and the new. Okay? But I want you guys to
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:59.440]   take a moment to appreciate this kind of talk because when we think about prophecy,
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:06.720]   prophecy actually, in some sense, is what I like to call enforcement of covenant.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:14.160]   What do I mean by that? Essentially, long ago, the nation of Israel looked at God and said, "God,
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:21.120]   we love you. Thank you for delivering us. We'll do everything you say." Right? So what did God do?
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:27.040]   Through Moses, God gave them a covenant, which is often called either the Sinai covenant or Mosaic
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.720]   covenant. Right? And God said, "Then this is how you're supposed to walk before me. Walk before me,
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:39.440]   holy and consecrated. Walk before me, devoted to me, have no other gods." And so the Ten Commandments and
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   all the commandments of the rituals were all for how the people were supposed to be faithful to him.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:52.240]   It was the rules of their relationship. It was the defining of their walk with God. Okay?
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.600]   When we come to prophecy, a lot of times it's so emotionally intense. It's because
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:06.480]   see how God feels when the people break that covenant. Jeremiah chapter 3, verse 1-3. Take a
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:13.200]   moment to follow along in this text with me. God says, "If a man divorces his wife and she goes
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:19.840]   from him and belongs to another man, will he still return to her? Will that land not be completely
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:26.960]   defiled but you? You're a prostitute with many lovers, yet you turn to me, declares the Lord. Raise
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   your eyes to the bare heights and see, where have you not been violated? You have sat for them by the
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.080]   roads like an Arab in the desert, and you have defiled the land with your prostitution and your wickedness.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:44.160]   Therefore, the showers have been withheld and there has been no spring rain. If you have a prostitute's
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:51.840]   forehead, you refuse to be ashamed." What he's saying there is that there is this brazenness about
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:57.040]   their sin. To say that you have a prostitute's forehead is actually just saying you have such
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:03.920]   brazenness, there's no guilt. You just keep doing it in such a rebellious fashion that you have no conviction
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:12.640]   that that's sin. You have no conviction that's hurting your husband. This is the way the word of prophecy
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:20.720]   comes. And so when we think about it, it's not just a harsh rebuke, it's God calling them and saying,
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:28.160]   do you understand what covenant relationship we had? Do you remember what as a people you committed to?
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:35.040]   And then, so now think back, do you remember when I highlighted for God to call them and said,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:42.880]   I'm going to rebuild you, O virgin Israel? How much they would have heard that and said, oh my gosh.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.280]   So, I have another passage, but I want to take time to just move forward and say,
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.200]   when we think about prophecy, just to wrap up the third reading, so to speak, and you read that portion,
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:03.200]   yes, like the prophecies has with it all these details about the future, but keep in mind the
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:10.080]   context of their relationship now, or now meaning in that text. But also keep in mind this idea that
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:16.320]   covenant was so important to the understanding of this. For God to have a relationship with them,
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.400]   it would be one thing to be like, you know, I'm going to give you common grace like I give everybody else.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:26.800]   Do you understand that God is a God who, in His love, desires to define that relationship?
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:35.360]   God is a God who binds Himself. He gives Himself so lavishly, so incredibly fully and thoroughly,
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:43.040]   that He uses the covenant, that He uses these parameters of a relationship, so that we would
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:49.600]   know exactly what we can expect from Him. Okay, in thinking about that, the fourth reading you should
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:54.400]   do whenever you read prophecy is you should be thinking about the character of God, the character
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.160]   of man, and the relationship. What do I mean by this is, yes, I mean, again, are these points that I'm
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.160]   giving you so unique to prophecy that you don't do it with other texts? No, this is not like so unique,
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:14.880]   but precisely because when God speaks in the word of prophetic language, He regularly starts to say,
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.000]   this is my perspective on what you're doing, right? That's the kind of picture that I'm trying to
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.120]   highlight for you over and over again, is prophecy is God's introduction of this is how I see
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:33.360]   you right now. And so whenever He says that, it tells us about Him, right? Typically how holy He is,
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.000]   typically how, you know, methodical He is, how intentionally He is, and all that kind of stuff.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.680]   And I'm going to leave it to you to discuss, especially in the passage that we learned today,
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:51.040]   what does it tell us about God? Well, I want to highlight for you something that just jumped out from
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:59.760]   the greater context in chapter 31, verse 20. He says, "Is Ephraim my dear son?" And Ephraim,
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.440]   this part, you know, you can just, most of your Bibles will have like a number, and it'll kind of
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:11.760]   define, it'll say like, oh, northern Israel, okay? It's because the people were already scattered and divided,
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:19.760]   he has different names for, you know, kind of different sect of the people. But he says, "Is Ephraim my dear
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:29.360]   son? Is he a delightful child?" Indeed. "As often I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him."
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:41.440]   Like, you gotta just camp out and meditate on that, right? To ask like, okay, so clearly God is looking
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:48.720]   at such a wicked and sinful people. He said, "I'm going to pluck you and destroy you." But then,
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:56.240]   now he's talking to his prophet, and he's like engaging with him, right? And Jeremiah better be careful,
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:02.240]   because if Jeremiah goes way too far and be like, "Yeah, you guys are a bunch of losers, you punks,
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.280]   you know? God's done with you." Because I started thinking about if I was Jeremiah and hearing all this
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:20.000]   stuff, I would be tempted to be like, "And you guys are trash. Utter trash." But then God says, "But is Ephraim my son?"
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:28.800]   He's asking Jeremiah, "Do you understand how I see Ephraim?" And he says, "It's my delightful son. I'm going to
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:36.400]   remember him." Wow. What does that tell us about our God? When God says that he is the heavenly father,
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:43.280]   he truly is the heavenly father, right? He is going to personally be the one to discipline them,
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:51.040]   and he's going to personally be the one to restore them. So beautiful. And what's amazing about this text is,
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.240]   even though this portion of it's like, "Oh, I have all these plans for you." Remember what I said is,
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.680]   in context, they're experiencing the deportation, and then they're going to experience the destruction,
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:09.600]   but God says there's going to be a very specific period of time, and no more. And just in the same
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:18.080]   way that my word of judgment against you is going to come exactly, my word of restoration for you will also
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:27.600]   come perfectly. That's our God. So I want to kind of conclude with that note. If you guys, again,
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.680]   have avoided the books of prophecy because you thought that there would be way too many confusing
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:40.880]   things, my word to you today is actually it's very, very clear. If we ask the right questions about what
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.480]   what is he promising? What are the covenants? And what is his character we're going to glean so much?
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:57.120]   Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for giving such a word of hope to us.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:05.760]   God, we know that your word is sure. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to believe. We also know,
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:12.960]   Father God, that just like the nation, we see our own sins, we see how frequently we fail,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:19.920]   and we understand, Lord God, how frustrating it can be. But thank you, God, that you give us hope of
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.640]   change. You grant to us hope of redemption and transformation. We know you will do a work in us
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.600]   in the same way that you have always done a work in your people. We thank you, God. It's in Christ's
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:39.840]   name. Amen. Okay, so next week, we are studying the book of Psalm chapter 27, as we will be hitting the
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:48.000]   poetry section of the Psalms. Also, as a short article, I wrote covenants of the Bible. Okay, so
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:58.160]   the scriptures has really important milestones of how God used his covenants to give a people the
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.480]   revelation of himself, his promises, or the stipulations of how he wants to relate to the people. I just kind
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.760]   of list for you those biblical references. It's not like you have to memorize them and all that kind
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.640]   of stuff, but just know those key milestones because those biblical covenants should dictate how we see
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:23.600]   God's redemptive history. Okay, I mentioned in there a little bit about how over time, theologians have
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:30.640]   identified other more theological covenants, but we don't like to use those because those are more like
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.320]   man's summary of the workings of history. Rather, we would just like to work off of biblical covenants,
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.280]   okay? All right, here are the discussion questions for you guys. Since they're a little long, I'll
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.000]   explain them a little bit. I do want you to imagine yourself as an Israelite, okay? Hearing Jeremiah just
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.560]   go off, you know? What would be your response? But more specifically, if you were the Israelite hearing
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.520]   these words of future promise, but you're looking at your friends and your people getting deported,
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:07.440]   what do you think your response would be, okay? Number two, uh, we discussed a lot about how the
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.520]   passage today in chapter 31 reveals God's character. If you have more observations to share, please share
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.440]   them. But I do also want you guys to think about indirectly, he doesn't say a whole lot about us or the
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.240]   people, but indirectly, what are the things that we can deduce and conclude about the needs of the people and the
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:32.240]   character of the people. Thirdly, meditate and appreciate God's God for the new covenant. We
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.920]   know that the new covenant is supremely better, but continue the discussion on how is it better?
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:44.400]   Why is it better? And again, just think about like, why is covenant even necessary between God and people?
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:51.680]   Okay? And then just for fun, do you think God will give Israel a future land? Okay? Why or why not?
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:41:06.960]   All right. Have a good time and discussion.
