[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.560]   We will now begin our service.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.800]   Welcome to Byrne Community Church.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.360]   I wanna begin by thanking all the people
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   who participated in the, what's wrong with me?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.720]   Auction, okay?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.480]   And again, the people who sponsored it
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.560]   and helped through all of that.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.960]   Again, I wanna thank all of you.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.040]   I was told that last year they raised 29,000,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.520]   this year they raised 37,000.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.680]   And so all of that is going to be going to good use
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.000]   as we are opening more and more doors to do mission work
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.040]   and all of that will be helpful to do all of that.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.500]   So again, thank you.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.920]   And the benefit from all of this obviously
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.120]   is that the whole church is interacting with each other.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.800]   You're gonna be visiting people's homes, babysitting.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.040]   There's gonna be some teenagers coming over to my house
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.400]   to do some yard work afterwards.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.560]   So thank you for participating in all of that.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.160]   Next week, Family Ministry Picnic is happening
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.200]   on 11 through 3 p.m. at Bill Barber Park in Irvine.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.240]   So this is open to anyone who desires to come,
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.580]   part of the family ministry.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.280]   You'll be able to meet your fellow believers,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.540]   brothers and sisters, just to kinda grab your own lunch
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.940]   and just show up at the park
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.940]   and you'll be able to meet some new people there
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.280]   and just, they're gonna be there from 11 to 3, okay?
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.120]   I'm gonna give a little plug on the fourfold disciplines
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.640]   of Christian life that I'll be leading
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.320]   and starting on May 28th, 7 p.m.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.980]   The reason why I'm doing that is because next Sunday,
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.280]   this is the only class that has a deadline
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.320]   and the reason why is because for the purpose
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.040]   of spiritual disciplines and as practice,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.840]   we have to put people in small groups.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.540]   And so we will need to know that
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.520]   by no later than next Sunday.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   So if you haven't signed up and you're planning to come,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.080]   please sign up as soon as possible
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.520]   'cause we're gonna start putting people into small groups.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   So this is, again, a great opportunity
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.120]   to use during the summer.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.760]   It's a four-week Wednesday night in the cafe area
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.880]   and it's gonna be more on the practice of discipline
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.720]   and not just theory.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.840]   So if this is something that will benefit you,
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.760]   please sign up for that
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.200]   and next Sunday will be the last time to sign up.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   All church retreat, that's happening on August 1st
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   through August 3rd.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.520]   That weekend, there will be worship here.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.280]   One service, but the rest of the church
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   will be up at the retreat site.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.960]   Typically, we have anywhere from 80 to 90%
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.280]   of the church that goes.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   And the guest speaker is Pastor Ray Cosley.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.840]   In particular, he's special to us
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.880]   'cause he was our first speaker.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.540]   He's come to our church about five times,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.640]   but he's probably one of our favorites.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.560]   And he said that he's going to come.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.920]   He's gonna be speaking on the subject of God's glory
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.960]   and how it affects everything that we do
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.880]   in the church in our lives.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.160]   And so please come to that.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.140]   It's a great opportunity,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.440]   not only to be fed by the word of God,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.920]   but opportunity to meet other believers, other members,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.360]   and even myself.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.120]   When I'm at retreats, I get to meet people
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.000]   that I don't normally run into.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   We have three services,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.380]   and so there's people who've been at our church for months
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.100]   and sometimes years and have very little interaction with.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.880]   So the retreat's an opportunity to speed up the process
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.480]   of rubbing shoulders with each other.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.720]   So I'm mentioning this because May 31st
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   is the last day to sign up pre-early registration.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.980]   So after that, the cost is going to go up.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.760]   So if you are planning to come, please do that.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.400]   And it'll help us to organize a small group, the rooms,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.600]   the various things that we need to prepare for.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.720]   So please try to register before the 31st.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.480]   And after that, again, the cost will be going up.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.560]   And then lastly, Mother's Day.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.000]   Today, obviously, today is Mother's Day.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.500]   After service, if you go outside,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.860]   you'll see a station out there with a Bundt cake, okay?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.380]   That's for all the moms.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.420]   Or maybe you wanna make an announcement today,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.100]   you can go grab it, and then we'll know why you grabbed it.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.100]   Okay, and then there's also flowers like this.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.740]   I brought a sample up here.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.940]   So again, make sure you grab that before you go.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.340]   Again, we wanna congratulate all the mothers
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.140]   and hopefully you feel loved and appreciated today.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.340]   Okay, so let me pray for the offering.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.960]   And then after the offering and our praise time,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.580]   our sister Mary is going to come up
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.480]   and give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.580]   All right, let's pray.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:55.220]   Father, we praise you and thank you for your goodness.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.440]   We thank you, Father God,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.260]   for the many things that we already know.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.540]   We thank you for the things that you're orchestrating now.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.260]   Ultimately, Lord God, for your glory and for our own good.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.100]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes, to see who you are,
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.540]   to understand your mind, your heart,
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.260]   that our will may be surrendered to you.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.660]   I pray that you would help us to use this time
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.280]   to come draw near to your throne.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.260]   And I pray, Father God, especially for our mothers,
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.340]   that in the midst of just their hard labor and sacrifice,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.740]   that they would feel loved and appreciated.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.040]   Just asking for your grace.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.220]   We pray, Father God, that the offering that we give
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.980]   would be an act of worship, devotion,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.900]   an overwhelming gratitude toward who you are,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.660]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.820]   for the sake of your kingdom.

[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.680]   (bell ringing)
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:23:01.780]   - Before coming to know Christ,
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.620]   I was a really headstrong person
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.020]   who focused on getting good grades,
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.340]   getting a decent job,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.260]   and getting recognition from those around me.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.500]   As the child of a single mom
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.820]   who immigrated when I was nine years old from China,
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   I focused on a lot of material success
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.700]   in order to help out my family,
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.500]   while not really knowing the need
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.020]   to depend on this all-powerful and all-knowing God.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.340]   My mind was always bogged down by worldly frustrations,
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.820]   and I felt like a lonely misfit at times,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.260]   not quite American like my friends who were born here,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.060]   but a little whitewashed compared to classmates
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.760]   who were born and raised in China.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.980]   Things began to change suddenly
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.380]   when my family got an invitation card in the mail
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.660]   and we started going out to church.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.220]   God's teachings first touched my heart
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.100]   when I was paralyzed by anxiety
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.340]   during this family conflict.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.580]   Proverbs 3:5-6 says,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.180]   "Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.240]   "and lean not on your own understanding.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.660]   "In all your ways acknowledge him
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.780]   "and he will make your path straight."
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.940]   With this verse in mind,
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.740]   I tackled the challenges of my adolescence
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.060]   with more confidence and ease.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.780]   There is a heavenly father above
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.100]   who knows me from inside out even better than myself,
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.700]   and he wants me to do well in life,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.700]   and he will grant me the riches of his kingdom
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.020]   according to his timing.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.100]   So my faith journey
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.940]   hasn't really been without difficulties though,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.440]   and I was constantly falling out
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.360]   of my relationship with Christ
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.640]   when I saw church as this glorified extracurricular
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.200]   and God as this genie in a bottle
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.000]   who would just grant me all of my wishes.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.400]   I was opportunistic in my engagement with the church,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.680]   fervently worshiping,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.080]   but coming back to this lukewarm state
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   after I got what I wanted.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.040]   After graduating from college though,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   I was repeatedly struck with the repercussion of sin,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.680]   and I realized how much my nominal Christianity
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.100]   clashed with God's intention
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.420]   to fill my heart with the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.100]   The most humbling instance
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.780]   was actually this time last year
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.260]   when I was desperately trying to change jobs.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.780]   Even though I attended church
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.740]   and seemed like a Christian on the surface level,
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.060]   my heart was void of any conviction,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.420]   and when I'm home by myself,
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.380]   I was still doomscroll on my phone
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.860]   watching one episode after another of my favorite TV shows.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.580]   The minutes would roll into hours,
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.680]   and that led me into a lot of anxiety,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.080]   eye strain, headaches, and eventually panic attacks.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.760]   In the depths of physical and mental struggle,
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.060]   I repented to God,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.520]   and I cried out, admitting that I was wrong.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.760]   I was building my life on shaky foundations all along,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.640]   and I sought forgiveness.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.080]   Gradually, I opened up my heart to God,
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.560]   not grabbing and taking what I needed from him,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.260]   but letting him reorder my life.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.220]   First Peter 5:7-8 says,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.500]   "Humble yourself, therefore, under God's almighty name,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.940]   "that he may lift you up in due time.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.840]   "Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you."
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.740]   I was eventually able to cast my anxiety on him
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.580]   when I meditated on his word,
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.080]   truly letting him speak to me in silence,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.300]   rather than just opening, reading, and closing the Bible.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.940]   And I attended volunteering activities at church,
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.560]   not with the goal of getting credit for myself,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.100]   but just giving thanks for the opportunity
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.840]   to build his kingdom on this earth.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.860]   Out of the many transformations that God has done in me,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.640]   the most profound one has really just been
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.700]   the heartfelt joy of knowing God himself.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.160]   And eventually, in his due timing,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.680]   God planted me here in Orange County
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.120]   with a new job that offered
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.300]   a brand new learning opportunity,
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.260]   but moreover, he planted me at Berean,
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.880]   a loving, Christ-centered community
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.680]   that really is allowing me to become a better Christian.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.200]   Although I'm still a sinner at heart
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.800]   who is always drawn to making mistakes,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.920]   I'm also compelled to constantly seek forgiveness from him,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.360]   to turn away from sin and towards Christ.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.920]   Harking back to Pastor Peter's message from last Sunday,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.700]   I don't want to be a pig who happens to have lipstick on.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.760]   I want to really live my Christian life
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.480]   from the inside out and have God take over control
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.500]   of all aspects of my life.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.340]   Because there is a heavenly father above
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.640]   who cares about me, who loves me,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.520]   and everything, everything that I am here is because of him,
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.920]   so I'm nothing without him.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.600]   And I live today very reassured by that.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.800]   Thank you.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:16.800]   (man speaking indistinctly)
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.460]   (man speaking indistinctly)
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:33.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:41.000]   - All right, thank you, Mary,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.400]   for that encouraging testimony.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.120]   to 1 Timothy 2, and I'm gonna be reading
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.360]   just from 12 down to 15, okay.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:29:02.240]   1 Timothy 2, verses 12 through 15,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.920]   and I know some of you guys are nervous.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.640]   Why did he choose this text for Mother's Day?
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.560]   Okay, hopefully you'll know at the end of the message, okay?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.440]   1 Timothy chapter two, 12 through 15.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.920]   But I do not allow a woman to teach
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.440]   or exercise authority over a man,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.560]   but to remain quiet, for it was Adam
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.840]   who was first created, and then Eve.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.320]   And it was not Adam who was deceived,
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.400]   but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.840]   But women will be preserved through the bearing of children
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.520]   if they continue in faith and love
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.680]   and sanctity with self-restraint.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.520]   Let's pray.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.920]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.400]   Thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.280]   to be able to come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.800]   Lord, we are in need of your help.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.400]   We're in need, Father God, of your Holy Spirit
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.080]   to soften our hearts, that we may be the good soil
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.680]   that receives your word, and by perseverance,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.080]   that we may bear fruit 30, 60, 100 fold.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.240]   So we pray, Father God, that your power,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.000]   your Holy Spirit, that your word would speak to us
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.160]   and would not return until it has accomplished your purpose.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:19.600]   The definition of feminism, according to Oxford Dictionary,
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.920]   says the advocacy of women's rights
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.720]   on the basis of equality of the sexes.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.040]   So by definition, it's for the purpose of equality for women.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.760]   But in the name of equality in our generation,
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   feminism was used as an excuse
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.200]   to fight for abortion rights for women.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.520]   Feminism was used as an excuse to fight for transgenderism,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.560]   that if a man says he's a woman,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.000]   that we need to respect that in the name of feminism.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.160]   In the name of feminism and equality,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   traditional family structure is looked at as oppressive,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.920]   that we need to do away with that
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.120]   and we need to restructure it
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   so that women can have equality.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   In the name of feminism, masculinity has become toxic.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.160]   Men are not allowed to be men.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.000]   But I think of all the things,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.920]   the damage that feminism has done in the name of equality
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.000]   has made motherhood something to be tolerated
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.360]   rather than to be honored and to be pursued.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.960]   And that's the reason why I want to take this text.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.460]   And I know that reading this text,
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.340]   just by reading it, some of you are nervous.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.580]   Somebody told me after the first service,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.940]   they said they got nervous as soon as they saw the text.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.580]   What is he going to say?
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   I would say that in the years that I've been at this church,
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.220]   the single subject that I get the most pushback
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.180]   is this subject, right?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.180]   Not politics, not homosexuality,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.400]   not liberal teaching,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.160]   not when I preach against seeker-friendly movement,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.920]   but it's this subject more than any other subject.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.040]   I've had people, as soon as I mentioned men's role,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.000]   that we don't have male elders in this church,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.920]   just get up and leave.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   You guys didn't see it
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.240]   'cause you guys are sitting up front.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.000]   They're usually sitting in the back and they would leave.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.080]   And then people in the back would tell me,
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.200]   did you see that person leave?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.600]   I've had people walk out of Bible studies
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.640]   as a result of teaching this text.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.160]   The text that we're looking at
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.140]   is actually written to combat feminism,
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.520]   to combat feminism.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.680]   You have to understand the context
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.320]   where this is being written.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.240]   In the early church, in the first century,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.200]   women had no rights.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.840]   Men could divorce their wives
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.320]   just because they felt like it, just by,
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.160]   so why are you giving your wife a certificate of a divorce?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.520]   They said, well, she burned the rice
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.880]   and I don't wanna eat burned rice.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.140]   That's how flippant it was.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.540]   Women had no rights.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.620]   Women could not testify in court by law.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.920]   They said women's testimony is not credible.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.600]   You should be offended by that.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.380]   Women were not counted in the Roman census.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.680]   So when you look at the early church
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.600]   and then they have numbers,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.360]   that's why when they say 5,000 people were fed,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.680]   there was a tradition of that time.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.080]   Women and children were not numbered, legally.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.680]   And the only way that they were numbered
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.300]   is when they say this man has this many wives
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.160]   and this many children.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.500]   That's the only way that they were able to count
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.040]   if the woman, so imagine if a woman were not married.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.560]   They didn't have any connection to a man.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.080]   They don't exist.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.040]   That's why many of the women, when they were divorced,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.660]   were forced to sell their bodies just to feed themselves.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.720]   That's the culture that they existed in.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.600]   Daily morning prayer of a Jewish man.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.800]   This is the daily morning prayer of a Jewish man said this.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   who has not made me a Gentile, who has not made me a slave,
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.260]   who has not made me a woman.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.320]   And you could see why they would pray that
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.160]   considering how the women were treated
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.480]   in the ancient culture.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   So it is in that context that Paul says in Galatians 3.28,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.840]   there is neither Jew nor Greek,
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.600]   there is neither slave nor free man,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.480]   there is neither male nor female,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.420]   for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.080]   We read this today and say, of course,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.480]   why is that even in there?
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.440]   Of course we're all equal.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.240]   Of course God loves all of us.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.920]   Of course we're God's children.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.120]   But you have to understand this in the culture of that time.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.880]   For Paul to say this, how offensive this must have been
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.440]   for Jews to say, to hear, there's no difference.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.000]   You're no more righteous than a Gentile.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.840]   For a slave owner to say,
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.160]   you have no more value than the slave that you own.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.760]   And for every male to say,
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.140]   you are no better in the kingdom of God than the females.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.080]   We are all one in Christ.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.680]   So it's something that we just don't even think twice about.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.080]   You have to understand in the first century,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.880]   what was controversial is not the text
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.240]   that we're looking at.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.780]   What was controversial is Galatians 3.28.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:20.920]   So why is 1 Timothy 2, 9 through 15 in here?
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.600]   Because in the name of equality,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.960]   because Christ came and he was trying to fix
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.640]   what went wrong because of sin.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.320]   Sin came in and ruined relationships,
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.920]   ruined God's creation order, his purpose.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.040]   And so God, in the restoration of the gospel
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.020]   in his new kingdom, he's trying to teach people
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.200]   that they have all equal value.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.040]   They're all children of God, men and women.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.200]   But in the context of restoring what went wrong,
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.080]   the concern was that they would take this too far,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.160]   just like feminism.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.120]   In the name of equality, they were fighting
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.760]   for all these things that were actually
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.300]   going to ruin society.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.680]   And so Paul is writing, 1 Timothy,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   in the role of man and woman,
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.340]   that this was God's intent.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   And so when we read, I do not permit a woman
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.600]   to teach or exercise authority over a man,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.840]   the first reaction that we get is what?
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.640]   Especially on Mother's Day, you know what I mean?
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.440]   Preach about motherhood and how great mothers are
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.360]   and how sacrificial you are, which I have in the past.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.720]   And I haven't given a special Mother's Day sermon in years,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.480]   and part of the reason why I didn't is because
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.800]   it's the Lord's Day, it's not the Mother's Day.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.300]   It's the Lord's Day first.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.040]   We don't put aside Jesus for one day
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.160]   so that we can honor you and worship you.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.160]   Which we're not doing today, right?
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.200]   Mothers deserve more than one day,
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.800]   and I think we all agree on that.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.240]   They sacrifice all year, and we have one day,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.920]   we cook them one meal, and then we say,
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.760]   get back to work.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.000]   So one day is not enough.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.160]   We all agree on that, right?
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.440]   But this knee-jerk reaction, I understand.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.880]   If you're sitting here and you read this text,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.360]   and it's like, I can't believe he's preaching on this
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.280]   on Mother's Day, I understand.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.320]   Because this was the first thing that I stumbled with
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.400]   after I became a Christian.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.840]   And I was at Biola studying, and they gave us,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.280]   and you could choose any subject,
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.600]   anything that you're wrestling with,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.560]   you can devote your time studying and come up with a paper,
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.320]   and I chose this subject.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.600]   And the reason why I chose this subject
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.160]   is because it didn't make any sense to me.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.700]   'Cause I had a female pastor that I really loved.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.320]   And when she would preach in the valley,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.160]   I would drive all the way down to the valley just to hear her.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.880]   If you asked me when I was 19 years old
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.360]   who my favorite pastor was, it was her.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.640]   And then I'd come and read it and say,
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.400]   well, we don't have female pastors.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.280]   It's like, what?
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.600]   And so I did a paper.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.360]   I spent the whole semester just doing a paper
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.880]   on this particular subject,
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.020]   and my conclusion that I came to was it bothered me,
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.460]   but clearly this is what the Bible teaches.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.720]   And since then, not only have I been convinced
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.840]   that the Word of God says this,
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.080]   I have been convinced over and over again
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.400]   the wisdom behind why this is here.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.580]   Why this is so necessary.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.840]   Why it is detrimental, not only to the church,
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.520]   but to the family when this is not being practiced.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   In 1 Corinthians 12, 31, Paul says to the Corinthians church,
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.800]   it was divided over who's better.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.640]   Is Apollos better?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.460]   Is Peter better?
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.280]   Is Paul better?
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.920]   So they're all competing with one another,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.320]   just like everybody else in society.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.740]   So everything that we do, we work out,
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.540]   we eat healthy, we run, we get jobs,
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.620]   and we go to school, all so that we can have a better life,
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.440]   so we can elevate ourselves.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:57.620]   And we do that even spiritually, even spiritually.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.020]   Like, who has a better theology?
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.140]   Who has a larger church?
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.220]   Who has more influence?
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.240]   Who is smarter?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.500]   And so that creeps into the church,
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.980]   and that's what happened to the Corinthians church.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.320]   They're all competing with one another,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.080]   and as a result of competing, the church went into chaos.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.260]   So he spends 12 chapters basically dissecting
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.140]   what went wrong, and then at the end of chapter 12,
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.180]   he says, "Earnestly desire the greater gift."
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.820]   Your desire to one-up one another,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.940]   to be better than the other person, is not from God.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:37.860]   Did you forget that very few of you had any honor,
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.160]   very few of you were educated,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.660]   very few of you had anything to brag about.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.600]   He said, "God chose you because you were nothing.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.440]   "You were base in society."
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.660]   So that the person who's gonna be preaching the gospel,
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.140]   the first generation Christians,
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.400]   would magnify him and not themselves.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   So in 12 chapters of dissecting,
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.300]   like a surgeon going in to find out where it went wrong,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.740]   and it was their desire to one-up each other.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.740]   And he says, "Desire the greater gift."
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.300]   And the greater gift, obviously he's referring to, is love.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.220]   And he spends a whole chapter in chapter 13
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.820]   describing about what this love looks like.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.320]   If you're gonna pursue anything,
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.620]   if you're gonna outdo anybody of anything,
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.860]   he said, "Do it for love."
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.720]   The greatest of the gift is love.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:30.260]   This knee-jerk reaction that we have toward this text,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:35.980]   is it coming from a desire to be holy or righteous
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.020]   because God has called me for this,
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.140]   and I have this, and I don't wanna disobey God?
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.700]   How much of the knee-jerk reaction
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.280]   is because our sense of fairness
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.480]   is coming from a broken world?
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.280]   That if you're in the front, you're better
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.720]   than the person who's not in the front.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.500]   If you're teaching, somehow you have more value
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.460]   than somebody who's not teaching.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.860]   When we know that Jesus says,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.660]   "The greatest in the kingdom of God is the one who serves."
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.520]   Not the one who has a position of honor,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.940]   but the one who serves.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.500]   The reason why we value what we value,
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.420]   and why there's a knee-jerk reaction toward this subject,
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.700]   is because the whole world system functions
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.980]   under this system.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.760]   That if you work hard, you make more money,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.820]   you read more books, you have better influence,
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.940]   you have better positions, you have better jobs,
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.700]   you went to a better school,
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.340]   you walk around with a little bit of pride
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.740]   and your neck gets a little bit stiff,
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.940]   that's the value of the whole world system.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.500]   Jesus comes in and he throws a wrench in all of that,
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.340]   flips the table upside down.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.780]   He has tax collectors who are leading.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.900]   Former prostitutes.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.340]   The very first apostle were just mere fishermen.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.420]   He didn't just tweak something,
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.600]   he flipped the whole world order upside down.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.460]   Satan's reason why he fell was because he saw
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.020]   what God had and he coveted it.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.820]   That's a temptation that he placed on Adam and Eve.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.740]   In fact, this restriction about teaching
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.140]   is not just for women.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.580]   It tells us in 1 Timothy 3.4, it said,
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.380]   "Don't let a new convert teach."
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.220]   Because he's gonna fall into the same temptation
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.220]   because he's vulnerable.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.320]   As soon as he begins to teach,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.340]   he's gonna get ruined, just like Satan.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.100]   So this restriction is not just for women,
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.040]   it's for new converts.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.100]   So if you're gonna be offended,
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.300]   new converts should be offended.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.020]   It also says in James chapter 3.1,
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.580]   "Not many of you should presume to be teachers
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.100]   "because you're gonna be under stricter judgment."
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.540]   How many of us desiring to teach
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.420]   consider the high calling of that position
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.680]   when it says you must be above reproach?
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.280]   How much of this coveting is we're coveting
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   the position of leadership, position of teaching,
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.660]   rather than realizing that if you get into that position,
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.060]   you're gonna be scrutinized.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.120]   The way you spend your money,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.460]   the way you spend your time, your pride,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.540]   your wife, your children, how you act under pressure,
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.180]   how you act when you're leisure,
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.880]   all of that's gonna be tested.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.720]   He said, "Therefore, don't let just anybody teach
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.700]   "'cause you're gonna be coming under stricter judgment."
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.220]   How much of this desire to teach
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.260]   is just simply because we consider being up in front
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.020]   better than not being up in front?
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:24.400]   So right off the bat, Jesus is, Paul is challenging.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.300]   Our way of thinking, our knee-jerk reaction could be
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.180]   is because so much of the world value system
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.560]   has seeped into us.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.660]   And why this is so important in order,
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.620]   as we celebrate Mother's Day, why what God had intended
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.460]   in creation for mothers and husbands and church
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.500]   that we need to recognize what it is.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.820]   He gives three reasons on this prohibition.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.900]   The role of men and women, in the family and in the home.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.740]   You have to understand that this is not a call
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.100]   for every woman to every man, okay?
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.900]   This is what, Timothy is a pastoral epistle,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.680]   meaning Paul's giving instructions to Timothy
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.380]   of how to order the church.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.700]   And the family is a reflection of the church,
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.680]   but this is not a commandment for all women to all men.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.240]   Just put that out there, okay?
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.660]   So the three reasons why he gives,
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.460]   why this needs to be practiced.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.300]   Number one, he says, "For it was Adam
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.540]   "who was first created, and then Eve."
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.580]   He goes back to the creation order.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.740]   You know, oftentimes people negate this passage
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.100]   and say, "Oh, it's cultural."
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.260]   But the reasoning behind it goes all the way from creation,
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.700]   God's intent.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.540]   If you look at Genesis chapter two, 15 to 23,
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.420]   it says, "Then the Lord God took the man,"
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.740]   okay, listen carefully,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.700]   because we have a lot of people who want to change
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.780]   the word man into mankind, right,
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.380]   because they're afraid to offend the feminists,
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.980]   but the wording is clear, and this is not mankind,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.940]   this is man, and I'll give you the reason why
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.700]   as we look at the text.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.040]   "The Lord God took the man and put him into the garden
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.620]   "of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.840]   "The Lord God commanded the man, saying,
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.240]   "'From any tree of the garden you may eat freely,
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.920]   "'but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.900]   "'you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it,
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.580]   "'you will surely die.'"
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.940]   The reason why we say that, I say that this is not mankind,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.560]   but man, because in the next text, he says,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.660]   "It is the Lord God, it is not good for the man to be alone."
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.960]   So after giving this command,
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.820]   why is it not good for him to be alone?
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.140]   In fact, previously, when God created man,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.820]   he said he ended all the creation by saying, "It is good."
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.040]   So when he said it's not good for man to be alone,
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.320]   it's because of the creation mandate that he gave.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.560]   And so, "Therefore, I will make him a helper
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.740]   "suitable for him," a helper.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.740]   He's been given the mandate,
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.740]   and the woman was created to help him.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.160]   "Out of the ground, the Lord God formed
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.220]   "every beast of the field and every bird of the sky
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.400]   "and brought them to the man to see what he would call them,
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.500]   "and whatever the man called the living creature,
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.940]   "that was its name," the man.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.840]   "The man gave names to all the cattle
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.740]   "and the birds of the sky and every beast of the field,
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.480]   "but for Adam, there was not found
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.980]   "a helper suitable for him."
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.460]   So, all of this was happening without Eve.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.780]   And he looks at that and he says, "It's not good."
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.940]   He creates a helper.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.300]   "So the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.980]   "to fall upon the man, and he slept.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.400]   "Then he took one of his ribs
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.100]   "and closed up the flesh at the place
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.160]   "the Lord God fashioned into a woman,
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.740]   "the rib which he had taken from the man
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.440]   "and brought her to the man, and the man said,
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.680]   "'This is now bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.420]   "'She shall be called woman
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   "'because she was taken out of man.'"
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.700]   So again, I hope you're following me up to this point.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.260]   The creation mandate was given to the man.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.020]   And over and over again, repeated,
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.140]   the man was given the, the man was commanded,
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.460]   the man was calling them.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.780]   And he said, "It's not good for him to be alone,
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.860]   "so he created a suitable helper from her,
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.940]   "and the name that he gives this woman is Isha."
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.580]   The Hebrew word for man is ish.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.560]   And so Isha basically means out of woman.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.700]   So even the title that he gives the woman
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.360]   is to come alongside, to support, and to help the woman.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:24.500]   So the reason why he says that there is order
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.740]   and God has placed this order in the family
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.700]   and in the church is because this was God's intent
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.720]   from creation, from creation.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.000]   When we pray the Lord's Prayer, we say,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.840]   "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.120]   "Thy kingdom come, your will be done
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.380]   "on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.520]   And we all know that, right?
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.960]   If you've been a Christian for any number of years,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.520]   you know that that is the Lord's Prayer.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.180]   He taught us how to pray, "Lord, your will be done."
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.680]   But the very first commandment that he gave
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.080]   was in creation right after he created Adam and Eve,
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.320]   that you are to be fruitful and to multiply,
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.020]   and the woman was created for the helper, to help him.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   So you can't pray that prayer.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.780]   If the very first thing that God has done
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.520]   and placed into mankind, we rebel against that.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   You can't go and say, "I wanna obey all these other things
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.400]   "that I think are important to me,
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.900]   "but the very order of creation, I refuse to obey."
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:32.820]   So he gives the creation as the first place.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.780]   Now, I know if you've been raised in this culture,
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   including myself, this is, yeah, that's what it says.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.540]   That's what it says.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.200]   And it's like, but you don't feel comfortable.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.980]   Is that right?
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.120]   There must be another way.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.180]   I heard other people interpret it another way.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.980]   I'm pretty sure the scripture's pretty clear.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.520]   There's a reason why the scripture says,
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.720]   "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.400]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.500]   Why does our mind need to be renewed?
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.280]   Because our mind has been filled
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.060]   with the values of our culture that has gone wrong.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.940]   Even our sense of what is right and what is wrong,
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.980]   what is good, what is bad,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.120]   has been tainted because of sin.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.740]   Our desire to be better, our desire to be taller,
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.500]   prettier, stronger, smarter,
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   it perverts the way we look at what is good and what is bad.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.620]   So even the way we look at the role of a man
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.340]   and the role of a woman has been tainted
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.900]   because of sin, of the desire to be somebody.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.320]   But he says, first and foremost,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.940]   this was God's intent in creation.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.780]   That's number one.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.540]   Number two, he says,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.020]   it was not Adam who was deceived,
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.940]   but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.220]   In Genesis three, one through nine,
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.740]   it describes this fall,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.220]   and I want you to pay attention to what this says.
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.720]   Now the serpent was more crafted than any beast of the field
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.820]   which the Lord God made, and he said to the woman,
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.040]   "Indeed, as God said,
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.980]   "you shall not eat from any tree of the garden."
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.180]   Let me stop right there.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:11.340]   If you look at creation and creation mandate,
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.740]   who is God speaking to?
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.180]   To the man.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.500]   If you get to chapter three, where the fall happens,
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.060]   who is the serpent speaking to?
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.740]   The woman, right?
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.500]   And this is not a small issue.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.820]   I want you to pay attention to that.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.680]   God gives the command to the man.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.840]   Serpent targets the woman, okay?
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.320]   Serpent said to the woman,
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   "Indeed, as God said,
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   "you shall not eat from any tree of the garden."
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.800]   The woman said to the serpent,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.480]   she shouldn't have been engaging him to begin with,
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.120]   "From the fruit of the trees of garden we may eat,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.420]   "but from the fruit of the tree,
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.620]   "which is in the middle of the garden,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.680]   "God has said you shall not eat from it,
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.520]   "or touch it, or you will die."
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.860]   The serpent said to the woman,
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.880]   "You surely will not die."
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.680]   Okay, this is a straight up lie.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.600]   "For God knows that in the day you eat from it,
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.120]   "your eyes will be opened and you will be like God,
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.560]   "knowing good and evil."
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.960]   In other words, the temptation was to covet what God has.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.360]   You shouldn't be okay.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.840]   He's just gonna be a helper.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.320]   The temptation was maybe,
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.500]   it's like, "Why can't I?
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.640]   "Why can't I have what he has?
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.060]   "And if I'm like God,
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.080]   "maybe I'll be elevated above Adam."
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.440]   No, I'm putting words in her mouth,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.760]   but maybe that was the temptation.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.840]   But the coveting was, she wanted to elevate herself.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.920]   "When the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.500]   "and that it was a delight to the eyes,
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.340]   "and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.440]   "she took from its fruit and ate,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.400]   "and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.260]   So one, in the creation order, God creates man,
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.960]   gives him the mandate to subdue, to take care of the land,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.760]   and he says it's not good for him to be alone,
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.640]   creates a wife out of a man to be a suitable helper.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.800]   Satan comes and tempts her, and then she gives in.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.680]   But the part that I want you to notice
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.580]   is at the end it says, "Where was Adam
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.880]   "when this was happening?"
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.000]   Where was Adam?
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.080]   Don't look at me, the answer's not here.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.720]   Answer's up there, where's Adam?
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.480]   She gave also to her husband who was with her,
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.320]   and he ate.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.040]   Adam didn't take a trip.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.480]   He didn't take a trip, and they come back,
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.280]   he's like, "What did you do?
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.520]   "God told us not to touch that, what are you doing?"
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.800]   Text tells us he was with her the whole time.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.600]   And you know what's interesting is after the fall,
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.760]   when God confronts their sin, who does God talk to?
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   Adam, says, "Adam, what did you do?"
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.840]   And Adam doesn't take any responsibility.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.560]   The responsibility was on his shoulder.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.160]   She was a suitable helper, you were the leader,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.720]   and then you hear what he says?
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.840]   "The woman, the woman you put here, that's why I fell."
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.480]   Adam was not able to shirk his responsibility.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.120]   In fact, in Romans chapter five, verse 12 and on,
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.640]   it tells us through the one man,
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.860]   doesn't say through the one woman,
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.080]   through that one man, sin had entered the world.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.560]   So God placed that burden on his shoulder
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.260]   because he was given the creation mandate.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:45.660]   He was given the creation mandate, she came to help,
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.920]   and then she falls into sin,
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.600]   and he stood there and watched it,
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.240]   and then he blamed her for it.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.980]   Scripture goes even further than that.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.400]   First Peter 3.7, it says, "Your husband, in the same way,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   "live with your wives as understanding way,
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.480]   "as with someone weaker," right?
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:08.100]   I mean, first text is hard, but this one, weaker.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.520]   This goes against everything that feminists teach.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.080]   Weaker, are you kidding?
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.200]   Especially in our culture.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.560]   When you say men are stronger, it's like, what?
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.240]   Well, how can you say that?
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.760]   Common sense, yeah, common sense, yeah.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.280]   'Cause I got eyes, I got eyes.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.720]   It's so ridiculous what has happened in our culture, right?
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.120]   Weaker in what sense?
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.860]   Weaker, first of all, physically.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.840]   If that offends you, something has seriously gone wrong.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.760]   You are physically weaker.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.180]   Does that make you any less?
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.260]   Are the guys in this room who are stronger,
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.740]   more valuable in the kingdom of God, right?
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.480]   Because they wear larger-sized shirts.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.880]   It's so ridiculous, right?
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.100]   So it's not offensive to say you're weaker,
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.860]   God created you that way, but you're also weaker
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.900]   because God has made you more delicate.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:16.300]   I brought the flowers in here because when we say
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.340]   to a guy, you're a pansy, right?
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.860]   Obviously, it's not a compliment.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.120]   It means you're delicate, you fold easily,
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.660]   you wither too quick, that's what we mean
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.580]   when we say, oh, you're a snowflake, right?
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:33.100]   Man up, right, suck it up, right?
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.140]   That's what we mean when we say be a man.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:41.340]   But to a woman, to say she's a pansy is not an offense
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.480]   'cause God has made you delicate.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.600]   And I remember the first time learning about that
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.100]   after I got married, 'cause Esther was my first
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.820]   real girlfriend, I grew up with boys, you know what I mean?
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.540]   We say whatever's on our mind, and if we don't like it,
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.460]   we punch each other, get on the floor, right,
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.300]   and we fight, and the next morning, we wake up,
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.940]   have breakfast, and then we go out, that's it,
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.860]   that's how we grew up.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.220]   So I remember the first time being married,
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.760]   like all our fights started with me saying,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.660]   it's just a joke. (audience laughing)
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:27.860]   I was just kidding, why is that such a big deal?
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.760]   It took me years, years to figure out, right?
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.020]   'Cause initially, it was unacceptable.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.480]   My brothers are okay with it.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.400]   Philip never responds this way.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   God made you more delicate, but that's a good thing.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.500]   That's a good thing.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.260]   God made you like flowers.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:01.760]   So when we say pansy, yeah, it requires more nurturing
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.480]   because God made you a nurturer.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:10.280]   God made us men like hammers, you know what I mean?
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.320]   We get things done, so even the way we communicate,
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.240]   we just get it done.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.120]   You say, what's the problem?
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.200]   It's like, well, here's the problem,
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.800]   let's hammer it and fix it.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.440]   That's usually the way we communicate.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.840]   Women will tell us about the color of the flower
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.800]   and the sun and the beauty and the smell.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.660]   It's like, no, but how do you fix it?
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:33.200]   'Cause God created us for the purpose of leading.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.360]   God created women for the purpose of supporting,
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.360]   and when they accept and embrace the creation mandate,
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:48.480]   not only does it bring joy to you, it glorifies God.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.260]   And so when the scripture tells us the reason why,
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:56.640]   it says you need to hold on to these roles,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.320]   it's because when these roles are reversed
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.120]   and when the women leads, this is what has happened.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.440]   You are not safe.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.880]   Men have been called to lead and to care
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.160]   and to shoulder the burden of leadership.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.120]   And when we shirk our responsibility
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.980]   and place that upon the women,
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.800]   our families fall apart, our church falls apart.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.960]   Adam should have been there to protect her.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.440]   Adam should have been there to tell Satan to get out.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.800]   Instead, he stood by there and then followed her
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.080]   and then blamed her.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:42.320]   God made women delicate.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   Can you imagine what this world would be like without women?
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.580]   I can.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.960]   Go to the gym, walk into the locker room.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.560]   That's what your house is gonna smell like without women.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.920]   It's nasty, right?
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.000]   Some of you guys live in all houses with just men.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.320]   Don't invite us.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.960]   I know what it smells like.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.800]   I know what it's like.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.240]   I'm not saying all of it is like that,
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.280]   but that's what the world would.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.360]   Can you imagine the whole world smelling like a locker room?
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   God has created men to be men and women to be women.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.920]   When men act like men and women act like women,
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   God's creation order is restored and God is glorified.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.220]   When you ask a man when he's frustrated with his wife,
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.920]   you know what typically they say?
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.340]   I don't feel respected.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:32.880]   If you ask a woman when she's frustrated
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.020]   with her marriage, you know what she says?
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.160]   I don't feel loved.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.480]   They weren't taught that.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.800]   You didn't have years of training
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:45.320]   that when you say you're frustrated, say it this way.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.140]   Why do you say that?
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.260]   Because at the core of who you are,
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.520]   that's how God created you.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.160]   So you feel happy and at peace when you feel loved
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.520]   because God has created you as a weaker vessel.
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.940]   Not weak as in value,
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.060]   but weak in the sense that God has created beauty in you
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.240]   for the purpose of supporting the man to do his work.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.700]   In Jude 6, it describes the fall of the satanic world
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.100]   and this is how it's described.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.340]   And angels who did not keep their own domain
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.500]   but abandoned their proper abode,
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.460]   he has kept in eternal bonds under darkness
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.300]   for the judgment of the great day.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.780]   There's a debate as to what this fall looked like.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.020]   What was their abode that they came out of?
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.580]   But the point of what he's trying to say
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.580]   is they didn't follow what they were created for.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.820]   And as a result of that,
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.420]   they're in rebellion and under the judgment of God.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:48.140]   So if we're going to be a church or a family
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.540]   that's going to restore what has gone wrong,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.900]   first and foremost, we need to revisit
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.840]   what God intended man to be.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.620]   There's a reason why Satan in our generation
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.500]   is erasing the line between male and female
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.620]   because that was the very first mandate.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.260]   So Satan is going back to the very beginning.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.860]   'Cause if you want to taint something,
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.060]   taint the beginning.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.780]   The beginning of God's creation was male and female
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.980]   and what God had intended for men to be and women to be.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.620]   If we're going to be a church
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.520]   that allows the gospel to restore us,
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.820]   we need to take this command seriously.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.580]   Third one, if you're squirming at your seat now,
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.880]   this one's going to be just as hard, okay?
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.720]   The third reason,
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.700]   but a woman will be saved through bearing children
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.540]   if they continue in faith and love
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.380]   and sanctity with self-restraint.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:49.500]   Now, is he saying that men are saved by grace
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.300]   but women are saved by childbearing?
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.200]   Right, how many of you believe that?
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.460]   We want to know the heretics in this room, right?
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.940]   Of course, of course that's not what it's saying, right?
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.580]   The word saved here in the NASB, it says to preserve.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.460]   The literal word is the same word as save,
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.500]   but obviously if I said, I saved my cat,
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.740]   doesn't mean that when they die,
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.860]   they're going to have eternal life, right?
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.940]   If the chair was broken and we took it
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.340]   and then we hammered it back in,
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.080]   we say, hey, that chair, we saved it.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.440]   Doesn't mean it has eternal life.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.800]   So we use the term save to restore,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.240]   to preserve in all kinds of ways.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.180]   So it's not just talking about justification.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.180]   Clearly, that's not what he's talking about here.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.840]   Then what does he mean then?
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.420]   In order to understand what he means by that,
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:41.320]   in Genesis 3:16, we need to understand the curse of the fall
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.700]   because this is related to the restoration of what was lost.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.060]   In Genesis 3:16, it said, "To the woman," he said,
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.160]   "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth,
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.200]   "in pain you will bring forth children,
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.960]   "yet your desire will be for your husband
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.120]   "and he will rule over you."
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.560]   The woman was created for this.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.360]   The woman was created so that the union with man
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.720]   would create children and together,
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.800]   they will be able to multiply.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.920]   But he said, you're going to bear children,
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.080]   but it's going to be done with pain.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.440]   In fact, the word pain is highlighted twice
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.280]   because the two words, your pain in childbirth,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.800]   in pain you will bring forth,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.260]   are two separate Hebrew words.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.120]   The first word for pain, isabon,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.200]   is in reference to anxiety, hardship.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.840]   The second word for pain, heseb,
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.760]   is referring to physical pain.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.320]   So when the curse comes in,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.520]   every aspect of what God intended in creation
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.480]   because of sin and this desire to one-up each other,
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.560]   this pride to elevate yourself,
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.000]   has taken what God has ordained
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.660]   and he said it's going to be very painful.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.860]   And when it says your desire is going to be for your husband
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.660]   the word for desire is to challenge and to usurp.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.500]   Meaning that this sin
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.980]   of wanting to be better than somebody else,
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.900]   and in particular, your own husband,
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.340]   is the cause of tremendous pain,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.740]   anxiety, and even physical pain, it says.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.860]   And as a result of that, he says,
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.520]   instead of him nurturing you, caring for you,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.660]   he said he's going to rule over you.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.120]   He's going to use his muscles to dominate you.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.380]   That's how he describes the fall.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.460]   For the man, his creation mandate
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.300]   was to be fruitful and multiply, to subdue the land.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.940]   The Bible says that he's going to be laboring all his life
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.780]   and at the end of it,
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.460]   all he's going to produce is thorns and thistles.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.260]   And then at the end of it, instead of producing life,
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.220]   he's going to go back to dust.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.900]   He's going to die.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.680]   So his creation mandate remains,
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.280]   but it's going to produce pain and suffering.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.680]   Her creation mandate remains,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.000]   but it's going to produce pain and suffering.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.160]   So what he's saying here in this text
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.140]   is to restore what was lost at creation.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.260]   In what way is she saved through childbearing?
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.760]   Obviously, it's not justification,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.060]   but I think to better understand it,
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.960]   if you look at 1 Corinthians 3.15,
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.480]   I think understanding that text
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.180]   will help us understand this text.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.280]   That text in 1 Corinthians 3.15,
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.720]   Paul is addressing people who are saying,
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.660]   "Well, Paul is better.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.560]   "Is Peter better?
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.120]   "Is Apollos better?"
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.240]   And he's saying all of them have value in the kingdom,
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.680]   but at the end, they're going to be tested with fire.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.980]   And only the things that remain after they are tested
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.360]   will they be rewarded.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.440]   Okay, do you understand that?
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.260]   So this is what it says.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.980]   "If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss,
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.300]   "but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire."
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.900]   So is that passage saying that fire is going to save him?
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.260]   Okay, don't look at me 'cause the answer's not here.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.340]   It's over there, right?
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.940]   Is that text saying fire is going to save that man?
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.500]   Because the language is the same.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.940]   Of course not, that's not what it's saying.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.340]   He's going to be tested through the fire.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.420]   And whatever is preserved through the fire,
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.800]   he says it will remain, right?
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.280]   So the text that we're looking at,
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.060]   he's not saying bearing children is going to save him.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:28.340]   What he is saying is that the pain and suffering
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.340]   that came in, that is producing pain,
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.900]   that God is going to preserve her
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.940]   through the difficulty that comes.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.840]   In the value, when we restore what God had intended.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.800]   Let me summarize this, okay?
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.380]   The reason why I chose this sermon is because our churches
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.220]   and our families are being attacked.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:01.940]   And our young men and women are so confused
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.060]   because of what's happening in our society.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.100]   Like, what is a man?
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:07.940]   What is a woman?
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.300]   What is our role?
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.820]   And even the churches are beginning to cave in
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.460]   in order to appease what's happening in our society.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:20.260]   But this is at the beginning of God's creation.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.540]   If this goes wrong, everything else
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.140]   is going to unravel with it.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.940]   If we're going to be a light,
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.560]   we have to be a light of what God has intended.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.540]   If we're going to pray, let your will be done
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.920]   on earth as it is in heaven,
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.340]   this is the first and foremost thing
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.900]   that we need to wrestle with.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.020]   The problem with our generation is we have young women
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.860]   who dream about one day they're going to become
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.620]   this profession or that profession,
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.580]   and I'm going to do this,
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.420]   and I'm going to become somebody big.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.540]   But if that woman says, I'm going to grow up,
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.780]   and I'm going to be the best mother I can be,
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.660]   all of a sudden the reaction is,
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.920]   what's wrong with you?
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.080]   Have some ambition.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.980]   Why are you oppressed?
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.960]   Why do you think that way?
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.840]   Who taught you?
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.440]   What kind of church do you go to?
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.840]   Something has seriously gone wrong
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.680]   when the greatest, greatest assignment,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.000]   the creation order, is repeated,
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.340]   and even in the church the response is, that's it?
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.860]   On this Mother's Day.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.760]   On this Mother's Day we need to realize
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.080]   that we are in battle.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.400]   We are in battle.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.820]   Men tend to wake up when there's an emergency.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:49.840]   We tend to become boys in times of peace.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.360]   Let's just admit it, right?
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.120]   When we're bored we start playing games.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.960]   We get involved with trivial things.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.240]   When war comes men become men.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.120]   So you see men who've gone through war,
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.880]   went to the military, they come back different men,
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.840]   they grow up, they snap out of it, right?
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.000]   We're in war.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.580]   We're in war.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:17.400]   We can't ask the women to be women
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.960]   until the men become men.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.640]   That's our responsibility.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.800]   That mandate's been given to us.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.360]   Adam should have stood before the gap.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.880]   And said this is not God's command.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.760]   Instead of standing there watching.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.640]   Let me get really personal, okay?
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.700]   If you're struggling with your girlfriend physically,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.660]   stop blaming her.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.080]   That's your fault.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.000]   Because God has placed the responsibility on you.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.960]   Does she have a responsibility before God?
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.800]   Of course.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.760]   But you're the leader.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.800]   You're the leader.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.240]   You take the responsibility.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.360]   This is me.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.820]   And you say me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.080]   We are the leaders.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.000]   And the best thing that a man could do
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.480]   is to create an environment where my wife
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.800]   can be the best mother that she can be.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:25.340]   So men need to be men so that the women can be women.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.100]   I'm gonna give you three practical advice.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   One, evangelism has to first start at home.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.480]   Don't send your kids to church
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.600]   hoping that the church will do the evangelism.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.200]   That responsibility is on the mother.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.840]   And then the father to create an environment
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.620]   where the mother can do that.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.620]   Two, do not make your child the center of your world.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.400]   You are ruining them.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.740]   Because once they leave your protection,
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.740]   nobody but you is gonna make them the center of their world.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.380]   So when you create a child walking around
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.980]   to look for their mom and dad
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.840]   who treated them as the center of the world,
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.420]   you're ruining them.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.480]   It's gonna ruin their marriage.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.660]   It's gonna ruin their friendship.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.120]   It's gonna ruin their future.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.960]   Love them, care for them,
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.760]   but don't make them your priority.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.820]   Third and finally, do not inoculate your children.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.420]   When we get vaccines,
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.680]   there's a little bit of that disease in that vaccine
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.900]   in order for your body to build up an immune system.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.940]   And so when the disease comes,
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.860]   that your body can fight against it.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.540]   That's what I mean by inoculation.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.540]   Many parents in a Christian home
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.340]   inoculate their children with the gospel
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.520]   so that when they get to the next stage of life,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.880]   they build up a tolerance against the gospel.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.360]   And they're much harder to reach
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.860]   because they heard everything.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.800]   And so everything that they know about Christ is theory,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.620]   but they haven't lived it
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.380]   because the parents didn't live it.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.260]   If you're not careful,
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:14.300]   you're gonna end up inoculating your children
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.300]   and you're gonna one day wake up and say,
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.220]   I brought them to church.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.100]   They were at Sunday school.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.060]   They were at VBS.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:20.900]   We serve.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.300]   What happened?
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.800]   I'm not saying that everybody who does that
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.780]   is gonna have godly children when they grow up,
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.100]   but if we're not careful,
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.140]   if we are nominal,
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.760]   our children are gonna be even harder to reach
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.920]   in the next generation.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.300]   So I wanna end today's service with this.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:46.700]   We live in a generation where every fundamental value
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.620]   that we have as Judeo-Christian is being attacked.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.380]   And if the men do not wake up,
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.900]   and if we live childish lives,
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.940]   then our wives cannot play the role
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.900]   that God has called them to play.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.300]   And if men are not being men
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.680]   and women are not being women,
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.420]   it doesn't matter how many verses you've memorized.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.900]   It doesn't matter how many theology
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   or books that you've read.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.000]   We've lost the battle.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.100]   So on this Mother's Day,
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.340]   let's honor our mothers.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.500]   And the best way that you men,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.540]   whether you're married or not,
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.060]   the best way that you can honor your mother and father,
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.120]   be the man that God called you to be.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.100]   Getting them flowers is great.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.980]   Hopefully you're gonna get them some candy
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.540]   and make some good dinner and all of that.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:39.940]   But none of that is gonna help
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.900]   if on a day-to-day basis you don't live like a man.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.380]   So psych, you thought this was gonna be for women.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.380]   It's for men.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.460]   (congregation laughing)
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.300]   Let's pray.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:14:01.780]   Father, we thank you for your grace.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.380]   We thank you for your patience.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:08.620]   Lord, all of us, we are guilty in some sense
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.700]   that we fall short.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.540]   So we thank you, Father God,
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.700]   that you are patient with us,
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.860]   that you're merciful, that you forgive us.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.260]   But help us, Lord God.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:23.520]   Help us, Lord God, to fight, to struggle, to wrestle.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.240]   As Paul said, that we would buffet our bodies,
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.500]   make it our slaves.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.920]   Yet after we have preached to others
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.520]   that we may not be disqualified.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.160]   Help us to honor you.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.520]   Help us to honor our mothers
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.380]   as they labor all year sacrificing.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.940]   May they receive the reward for their sacrifices.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.960]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:53.800]   (gentle piano music)
