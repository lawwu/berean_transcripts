[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:04.920]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.940]   Welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.720]   Let me begin by welcoming those who are coming into town
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.080]   because of school starting.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.360]   I know this is a welcome week.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.060]   And so we have a welcome table stationed outside.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.680]   As you were coming in, you probably saw a canopy
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.640]   and a bunch of tables that are set up,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.120]   especially if you are coming in
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   and you want some information about our college department,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.040]   meet some of our staff here.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.580]   If you go to that table outside,
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.160]   they'll give you all the information that you need
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.240]   and give you the various schedules,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.160]   things that are going on.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.300]   There's a lot of stuff going on,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.320]   especially with the college ministry this week.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.400]   So please go to that table
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.500]   and they'll give you the information that you need.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.080]   Our membership class, our next round of membership class
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.680]   is starting on September 29th,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.080]   which is next Sunday at 9.30.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.360]   It's an eight-week course.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.880]   And if you desire to be a member of the church,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.180]   please sign up for that.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.040]   And they'll give you directions on what's gonna happen.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.720]   Again, this is happening during this service at 9.30
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.160]   across the courtyard in our youth group room, okay?
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.680]   So please sign up for that if you are planning to do that.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   And then our regional Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.720]   they have about 25 people who have already signed up.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.200]   They said they need another about 20 to 25 people
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.040]   to sign up.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.260]   If you are interested in hosting,
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.060]   then serving the church in that way,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.320]   there is a table outside.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.120]   And again, this is not for the regular sign up
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.760]   for just to participate.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.480]   But if you're willing to host
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.160]   and you can fit maybe about 20, 25 people in your house,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   that's happening again on November 24th at 5 p.m.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.720]   But if you're able to host and you're willing to do that,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.480]   that sign up is on the courtyard.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.200]   As you're going out, you'll meet the table
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   and you can sign up there, okay?
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.040]   If you are at the age of 50 or over,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.980]   okay, so part of the Jubilee Ministry,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.700]   on October 12th at 8.30, which is a Saturday in the cafe,
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.360]   we're gonna be having a prayer breakfast.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.800]   So all those who are 50 and over,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.280]   part of the Jubilee Ministry.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.920]   And a fee for that is gonna be $10 for breakfast.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.800]   So please sign up for that as well.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.760]   And then lastly, our Volunteers for Reformation Night,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.480]   which is happening on October 31st at 4.30 p.m.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.440]   So if you're willing to come and set up
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.560]   or even help clean up or run some of the games,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.400]   please sign up.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.000]   And I think that sign up for that
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.480]   is also at the table outside.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.380]   So if you go outside and just let them know
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.000]   that you wanna volunteer,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.680]   they'll give you directions and the meetings
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.260]   that are gonna come from that, okay?
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.340]   All right, I think that's all we have for this morning.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.160]   Let me pray for us
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.900]   and give you an opportunity to give online.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.240]   And again, if you brought a physical offering,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.180]   we have a box in the back on the way out.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.080]   You can visit that box on the way out, all right?
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.040]   Let me pray for us.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.720]   Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.880]   We pray, Father God,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   that we would never give into just a routine or a habit,
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.600]   but that the worship that we give you from our hearts
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.800]   will be an overflow of the great work
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.280]   that you are doing in us.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.040]   Help us to recognize what it is
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.280]   that we have been given in Christ,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.360]   that our worship truly would be genuine,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.840]   an overflow of gratitude.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.160]   I pray this morning that you would help us
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.880]   not to be entangled with the things of this world,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.300]   whatever we have brought into this room,
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.960]   that you would help us to focus our attention
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.840]   on Christ and his word.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   And I pray that even in this giving
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.240]   that we would give as an act of worship
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.280]   and maybe multiply 30, 60, a hundredfold
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.680]   for the sake of your name.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.760]   (gentle music)
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.880]   (pages flipping)

[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:20.860]   Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.760]   just to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.900]   (audience chattering)
