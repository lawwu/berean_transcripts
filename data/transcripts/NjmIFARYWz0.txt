[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:59.960]   Thank you.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:29.940]   Thank you.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:59.920]   Thank you.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:29.900]   Thank you.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:59.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:29.860]   Thank you.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:59.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:29.820]   Thank you.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:59.800]   Thank you.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:29.780]   Thank you.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:39.780]   Let no vice or sin remain that resist your holy woe.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:06:09.760]   Thank you.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:39.740]   Thank you.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:07:09.720]   Help me now.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:39.700]   Thank you.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:08:09.680]   Thank you.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:39.660]   Thank you.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:09:09.640]   Thank you.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:39.620]   Thank you.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:10:09.600]   Thank you.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:39.580]   Thank you.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:11:09.560]   Thank you.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:39.540]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:12:09.520]   Thank you.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:39.500]   Thank you.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:13:09.480]   Thank you.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:39.460]   Thank you.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:14:09.440]   Thank you.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:39.420]   Thank you.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:15:09.400]   Thank you.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:39.380]   Thank you.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:16:09.360]   Thank you.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:39.340]   Thank you.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:17:09.320]   Thank you.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:39.300]   Thank you.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:18:09.280]   When years of time.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:39.260]   Thank you.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:19:09.240]   Thank you.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:39.220]   Thank you.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:20:09.200]   Thank you.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:39.180]   Thank you.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:21:09.160]   Thank you.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:39.140]   Thank you.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:22:09.120]   Thank you.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:39.100]   Thank you.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:23:09.080]   Thank you.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:39.060]   Thank you.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:24:09.040]   Thank you.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:39.020]   Thank you.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:25:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:38.980]   Thank you.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:26:08.960]   Thank you.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:38.940]   Thank you.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:27:08.920]   Thank you.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:38.900]   Thank you.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:28:08.880]   Thank you.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:38.860]   Thank you.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:29:08.840]   Thank you.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:38.820]   Thank you.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:30:08.800]   Thank you.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:38.780]   Thank you.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:31:08.760]   Thank you.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:38.740]   Thank you.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:32:08.720]   Thank you.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:38.700]   Thank you.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:33:08.680]   Thank you.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:38.660]   Thank you.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:34:08.640]   Thank you.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:38.620]   Thank you.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:35:08.600]   Thank you.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:38.580]   Thank you.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:36:08.560]   Thank you.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:38.540]   Thank you.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:37:08.520]   Thank you.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:38.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:38:08.480]   Thank you.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:38.460]   Thank you.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:39:08.440]   Thank you.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:38.420]   Thank you.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:40:08.400]   Thank you.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:38.380]   Thank you.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:41:08.360]   Thank you.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:38.340]   Thank you.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:42:08.320]   Thank you.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:38.300]   Thank you.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:43:08.280]   Thank you.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:38.260]   Thank you.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:44:08.240]   Thank you.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:38.220]   Thank you.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:45:08.200]   Thank you.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:38.180]   Thank you.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:46:08.160]   Thank you.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:38.140]   Thank you.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:44.080]   alert and sober. For those who sleep, do their sleeping at night. Those who get drunk, get drunk
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.720]   at night. But since we are of the day, let us be sober. Having put on the breastplate of faith,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:56.000]   love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. It's not time to sleep.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:04.880]   People who want to sleep don't want the light on. They don't want strong messages. They don't want
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.300]   to be disturbed because they want to go to sleep. They're trying to rest. And when I come to church,
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:18.520]   I don't feel any rest. I feel stirred, and I don't want to be stirred because I want to go to sleep.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:25.220]   So if you have a peacetime mentality, if you have a bunker mentality, everything that you're going to
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:30.840]   hear and see is going to be, does this help me to rest? When he says, no, it's not time for you to go
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:36.520]   to sleep. He says to wake up. There will be a time when you will rest when he comes.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.900]   There will be a time when we're in heaven where we don't have to worry about enemies.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.160]   Where we don't have to shine our light because there's going to be a greater light that's going
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:53.540]   to be on constantly. But now we are to shine that light in this dark world. So as long as we are here,
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:00.020]   he says, keep your lamps lit. 1 Peter 5, 7 and 8, cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:05.820]   you. Be of sober spirit. Be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:13.140]   lion seeking someone to devour. When's the last time you thought that you have an enemy who's
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:19.180]   very sober? Very sober, very alert prowling around to get you. You know how he gets you?
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:26.600]   He's not dressed in horns waiting in the bathroom in dark corners or in bad neighborhoods.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:35.260]   The way he gets you is through your thoughts. How you feel, what you covet, what you listen to,
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:41.580]   what you see. That's how he gets you. So through your thoughts, through your desire, through your
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.720]   coveting, you begin to feel a certain way and those feelings begin to dictate what is right and wrong
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:53.060]   for you. And all of a sudden you're deceived and you don't even know it. That's why he says, stay sober.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:49:01.920]   Be alert. Keep your lamps lit. In Matthew 24, 37, 38, for the coming of the Son of Man will be just
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.720]   like the days of Noah. For as in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying,
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:12.840]   giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark. They didn't say, you know,
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   they were involved in debauchery, sinning, and they were getting drunk. They were, no. They were just
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.580]   living like everybody else, unaware of the judgment that was coming, eating and drinking and marrying.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:31.280]   Yeah, just like everybody else. Because they were unaware of what was happening. They were unaware of
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.880]   their sins. They were unaware of their rebellion. They were unaware of God's anger burning against
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:43.160]   them. So they were eating and drinking. I mean, it's interesting. It doesn't describe the debauchery.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:50.420]   It doesn't describe orgies that were happening and child, you know, murder or sacrifice. No,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.760]   it's just, they were just eating and drinking. Our greatest challenge is this.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:04.960]   What squashes our passion for Christ? What causes the Word of God to be, to be squashed
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:13.140]   in our lives is eating and drinking. It's daily concerns like everybody else. But I got to pay my bills.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:17.800]   I got to raise my children. I got to do this. And I got to, God didn't call everybody.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:23.980]   The next thing you know, whatever passion you had when you were young, you no longer have.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:29.260]   That's why you're passionate when you're in high school or in college. And then you graduate and
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.060]   you start working, paying bills, and then you get married. And next thing you know,
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:37.020]   it's just a distant memory of how you used to be when you were young.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:43.000]   And if you think about it, it's not because you chose to serve the devil. It's not because you
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:52.600]   chose not to love Jesus. You just love the world a bit more. Next thing you know, the words that
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.560]   we're singing has no effect on you. The Word of God just seems like information. Bible study just
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.480]   seems like homework. You're no longer passionately seeking Christ.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:13.500]   It says in Revelations, I'm sorry, Isaiah 40, 31, it says, we eagerly wait, right? Keep your lamps on
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:19.420]   because your master who's at a wedding, he's going to come back. And so that when he comes back that
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:26.600]   you can immediately open the door, right? He talks about a banquet that when he comes that he's going
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:33.120]   to throw a bank in. Isaiah 40, 31, it says, though yet those who wait for the Lord, they will mount up
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.820]   with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary. Those
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:44.660]   who are eagerly waiting for the Lord to come back, they're going to find strength, right? Your strength
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.700]   doesn't come from accountability. Your strength doesn't come from being at a good church.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:54.680]   Your strength doesn't come because you have a mentor in your life.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.760]   He said, your strength comes from eagerly waiting for the Lord.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:04.940]   Eagerly waiting for the Lord. Why are you eagerly waiting for the Lord? Because he's your
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:09.640]   general. He's your captain. If we're in the context of struggle,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.620]   you're going to hope that he will come because
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.120]   the final captain
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.180]   over all things.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.620]   He said, when he comes, and when you eagerly wait for him, he said, you will find strength.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.360]   Our conviction
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.740]   to live
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.800]   godly lives
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.600]   and risk everything
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.520]   comes from, comes directly
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.860]   knowing that our home is over there
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.600]   when he comes.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.940]   It's not here. We get so caught up,
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.760]   worried about our house, our budget,
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.720]   or how much money that we've saved.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.180]   God, our security comes from our job
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.440]   and the security of our job
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.060]   and friends that we have.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.720]   He said, no, that's where
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.960]   those are superficial things that come and go.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.780]   When you have it, you feel falsely secure.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.780]   And then when you don't have it, your world falls apart.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.260]   It's because we put our confidence in the wrong things.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.500]   He says, he who waits upon the Lord
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.880]   will gain strength.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.300]   Again, in 1 John 2, 3, 2 to 3,
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.080]   beloved, now we are children of God
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.760]   and it has not appeared yet
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.560]   what we will be.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.420]   We know that when he appears,
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.760]   we will be like him.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.920]   Because we will see him
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.740]   just as he is
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.040]   and everyone who has
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.540]   this hope fixed upon him
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.740]   purify himself
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.880]   just as he is pure.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.720]   Let me get to the nitty-gritty, okay?
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.440]   So many people struggle with porn.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.080]   Typically, we think like, you know,
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.380]   guys struggle with porn.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.820]   And we live in a generation
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.460]   where the access has become so easy.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.140]   Many of the ladies are struggling with this.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.980]   This is destroying the church.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:52.040]   And they're saying, well, how do I overcome it?
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.460]   Well, if we look back at the core of it
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.620]   and I can talk you out of it,
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.900]   maybe if we had enough accountability,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.860]   maybe if we shamed you enough,
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.500]   maybe if we read more books,
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.860]   maybe if there was more grace
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.640]   and people felt comfortable sharing.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.400]   And you can go all of that.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.160]   But he says,
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.360]   He who fixes his eyes upon the coming of Christ,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.720]   he purifies himself.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.020]   You know why I don't want to watch porn?
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.080]   Because I have to preach on Sunday.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.140]   You know why I don't want to watch porn?
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.520]   Because I want to share the gospel.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.420]   I don't want to watch porn
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.000]   because the next time I talk to somebody
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   about Jesus Christ,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.320]   I don't want
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.040]   my eyes to be filled with filth
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.280]   and prevents me
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.620]   to speak with confidence
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.360]   and conviction.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.040]   Because as soon as my eyes
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.640]   are filled with filthy things,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.520]   it prevents me to be bold.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.640]   And I don't want to be in a position
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.880]   where I'm compromised.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.640]   So the desire to be pure
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.840]   comes from this mission.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.220]   Because I want him to come.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.700]   And I want people to be saved.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.560]   But if you're not committed to the mission,
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.260]   and when you sin,
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.960]   the only thing that you're worried about
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.020]   is feeling bad.
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.880]   I feel bad.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.780]   I shouldn't do this.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.040]   But you don't realize
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.240]   the effect that it has.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.360]   Why you are not able to be bold.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.260]   Why convictions die.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.540]   Because we are compromised by sin.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.980]   He says,
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.220]   He who fixes his eyes upon him,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.280]   he purifies himself
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.320]   just as he is pure.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.080]   And he says,
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.920]   When he comes,
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.280]   be ready,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.640]   because he's knocking at the door.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.900]   Revelation 3.20,
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.360]   Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.540]   If anyone hears my voice
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.360]   and opens the door,
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.460]   I will come to him
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.080]   and will dine with him
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.420]   and he with me.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.680]   Not only has he gone
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.360]   to the wedding feast,
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.260]   when he comes back,
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.060]   he said,
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.500]   He's going to have
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.460]   a wedding feast with us.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.220]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.500]   That the master
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.420]   is going to come
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.480]   and serve the servants.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.000]   And that's how
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.540]   it's described
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.460]   all over scripture.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.100]   In Isaiah 25.6,
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.280]   The Lord of hosts
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:01.820]   will prepare
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.740]   a lavish banquet
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.560]   for all people
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.220]   on the mountains,
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.480]   a banquet of aged wine,
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.040]   choice piece and marrow,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.540]   and refined aged wine.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.900]   He said,
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.660]   When he comes,
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.260]   the host
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.260]   is going to throw
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:12.900]   a banquet.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.240]   And so we're eagerly
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.260]   waiting for this banquet
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:17.820]   to happen.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.760]   I've probably been
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.300]   to over 200 weddings,
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.040]   officiated over 150 weddings.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.360]   So I've been intimately involved
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.700]   with so many weddings.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.240]   And the most common question
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:28.860]   that people have
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.120]   is that,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.360]   Don't you get tired?
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.900]   We have a string of weddings
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.740]   like we're in the middle
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.280]   of right now.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.360]   Don't you get tired?
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.520]   Doesn't it get old?
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.440]   Never.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.100]   I mean,
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.540]   how can you get tired
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:43.320]   of a party?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:44.600]   Right?
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.860]   The two young people
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:47.860]   who are starting
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.860]   a new life together
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:49.380]   that they're going
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:49.920]   to remember
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.740]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:52.820]   It never gets old.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.580]   I never come back
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.140]   from a wedding and say,
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.180]   Ah, yeah, man,
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:56.740]   I don't want to go
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.420]   to any more weddings.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.720]   Never.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.780]   I mean,
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.860]   because everybody's there.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.840]   We're talking about Christ.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.300]   We're enjoying
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.020]   each other's company.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.860]   Everybody that loves
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.540]   each other are there.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:06.820]   I mean,
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.980]   it's never depressing.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:11.600]   He says he's going
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.360]   to come and throw
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:12.860]   a banquet.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.340]   He says,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:14.760]   but you need
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.640]   to open the door.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.620]   Psalm 23, 5,
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:19.500]   you prepare a table
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:19.980]   before me
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.520]   in the presence
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.420]   of my enemies.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.180]   He said,
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.260]   even as he is facing
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.220]   death,
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.060]   the valley of the shadow
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:27.440]   of death,
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:27.940]   he says,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.840]   but you're going
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.780]   to prepare a table
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.040]   before me.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.540]   You're going to prepare
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.040]   a banquet
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:31.700]   in the presence
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.500]   of my enemies.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.920]   Luke 13, 29,
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   and they will come
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.880]   from east and west
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.840]   and from north and south
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.420]   and reclined
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:38.960]   at the table
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.420]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.340]   so this,
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.520]   why are we
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.260]   taking the light
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.840]   into the darkness?
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.320]   So that they can
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.120]   also come
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.340]   to the banqueting table.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.660]   We're not simply
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.380]   going to the dark
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:54.660]   and say,
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:54.940]   hey,
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.080]   you need to suffer too.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.660]   You need to have
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:57.360]   a difficulty.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:57.640]   No,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.520]   we're inviting them
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.040]   to the banquet.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.120]   When you invite people
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:03.780]   to your banquet,
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:04.300]   you're inviting,
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.060]   who am I going
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:05.820]   to celebrate it?
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.600]   Who do you love?
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.340]   Who loves you?
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.360]   That's the criteria
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.640]   that you go through
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.600]   to see who's going
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.400]   to come to the banquet.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.240]   Who's going to rejoice
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:14.620]   with you?
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.780]   Who's going to celebrate
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.360]   with you?
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.420]   So we're going out
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:19.960]   to the world
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.020]   who does not know Christ
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:21.900]   so that they may be
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.660]   invited also
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:23.780]   to this banquet.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.740]   Revelation chapter 19,
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.040]   9,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:27.860]   then he said to me,
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.260]   write,
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.540]   blessed are those
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.180]   who are invited
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.020]   to the marriage supper
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.500]   of the Lamb.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.340]   and he said to me,
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.560]   these are the true
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.680]   words of God.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.920]   You don't know
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.620]   when he's going to come.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.740]   It might be the third
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:39.440]   or fourth hour,
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.520]   meaning anywhere
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.060]   from 9 to 3 a.m.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.140]   Depending on how
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.780]   you calculate
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.720]   the Jewish time,
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.580]   basically he's saying,
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.120]   you don't know.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.340]   Not just during the day,
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.760]   but when you least
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.280]   suspect it.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   When everybody else
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.020]   is sleeping,
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:54.740]   he says,
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:55.440]   stay awake.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.660]   And that's the struggle
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.640]   of being rich
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.280]   because our circumstances
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.860]   constantly lure us
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.180]   to think that we are
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:05.980]   at peace.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.840]   And because our circumstance
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.500]   makes us feel like
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.240]   we are at peace,
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.840]   we live like we're at peace,
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.080]   and then all of a sudden
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.480]   our greatest treasure
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.740]   is choked.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.040]   So you don't find
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:20.740]   joy in Christ.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.980]   You find the love
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.640]   of Christ,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.860]   the peace of Christ,
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.480]   answered prayers,
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.960]   good friends who remember
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.780]   you and your birthday.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.640]   but you're not
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.880]   weeping for the lost.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.820]   That's what Christ
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.220]   is doing.
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.100]   He's weeping for the,
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:38.900]   he forsook everything
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.700]   to come and seek
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:41.580]   and save the lost.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.700]   We can say we're
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:45.420]   following Christ,
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:45.980]   but if we're not
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.680]   actually following
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.260]   in his footsteps,
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.640]   you're not going to
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.480]   understand why
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.080]   he's doing what
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.520]   he's doing.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.740]   He's inviting us
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.160]   to the banqueting feast,
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:56.680]   and then he says,
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.280]   if you don't receive him
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.120]   and understand this banquet,
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.180]   and he said,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:01.900]   he's going to come
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.060]   like a thief in the night.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.920]   The coming of Christ
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.120]   is either going to be
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.140]   at the door open
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.240]   to the banqueting table
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.220]   of heaven,
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.160]   or people are going
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:11.800]   to receive him
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.400]   like a thief
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:12.900]   that's coming.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.020]   And that imagery
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.200]   is used over and over again
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.320]   in the New Testament.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.520]   his second coming
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.100]   is going to be
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:20.660]   like a thief
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.860]   for those who are asleep,
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.180]   for those who are not awake,
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.160]   for those who are
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.800]   constantly living in FOMO.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.720]   You know how many people
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.320]   tell me,
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.420]   like,
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.980]   are you waiting for Jesus?
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.280]   He's like,
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:31.740]   oh yeah,
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.080]   you know,
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.240]   but can I get married first?
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.800]   Right?
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.240]   Trust me.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.520]   At the banqueting table,
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.140]   you're not going to say,
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.760]   oh,
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.360]   you should have given me
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:42.800]   a couple more.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.220]   Right?
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:45.740]   Trust me,
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.580]   you're going to forget.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.220]   When he comes,
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:49.780]   you're not going to say,
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.320]   you know what,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.300]   my bucket list,
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.400]   I have seven down,
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.380]   I got three more to go.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.500]   You know,
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.880]   I really wanted to go to Banff
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.340]   and I couldn't,
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.560]   so can you come tomorrow?
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.080]   Give me a couple more days.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.820]   Right?
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:02.020]   You're going to forget
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.460]   all of this is going
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.240]   to look like trash
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.080]   when the new heavens
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.980]   and new earth comes.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.160]   Everything that we were
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:09.720]   tempted by,
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.440]   we're going to look back
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:10.840]   at it and say,
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.280]   I was tempted by that?
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.700]   Right?
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.900]   Do you remember
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:16.480]   some of the things
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.420]   that you were tempted by?
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.420]   Some of the clothes
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:18.980]   that you wore
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.100]   and how you had your hair
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   when you were 15 years old?
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.860]   Do you look at that
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.140]   and say,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.860]   I wish that would come back?
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.140]   Some of it was so ugly.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.860]   Let me just share one,
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.120]   okay?
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.260]   There was a period
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.940]   when a bunch of Asian guys
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.620]   had their hairs braided
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.740]   and down their face
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.180]   like this
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.320]   and then they wore a size,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.840]   50 waist
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.680]   when their actual size
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.460]   was 26.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.220]   Okay, anyway,
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:51.520]   let me,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.480]   I need to finish my message.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.980]   Do you look back at that
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.280]   and say,
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.900]   I wish that would come back?
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.440]   I wish.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.020]   Do you look at that
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.440]   with covet?
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.180]   Think about,
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.100]   you know,
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.940]   there might be some,
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.260]   somebody that you were
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.700]   very attracted to
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:10.540]   10 years ago
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.140]   and you look back
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.720]   at that and it's like,
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.520]   what was I thinking?
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.140]   When Christ comes,
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.860]   everything that you coveted
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.980]   is going to look like rubbish.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.600]   Don't be caught off
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.100]   like a thief
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.260]   because when the thief comes,
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.720]   he comes to take,
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.360]   to destroy,
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.120]   to disturb
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.060]   if you're not ready,
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.060]   if you're not alert
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:35.940]   and if you're not sober,
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.920]   if you're not engaged
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.820]   in the mission
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.780]   that he's called us to.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.340]   In Luke 12,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.160]   39 to 40,
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.300]   but be sure of this,
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.000]   that the head of the house
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.540]   had known
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.280]   at what hour
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.120]   the thief was coming,
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.180]   he would not have allowed
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.440]   his house to be broken into.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.200]   You too,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:52.960]   be ready
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.080]   for the Son of Man
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.220]   is coming at an hour
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.700]   that you do not expect.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.200]   I want to finish
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.440]   my sermon today.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.660]   Do you have that video?
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:12.860]   Are you guys,
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.420]   you ready?
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.200]   Okay.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.800]   Can I have the praise team
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.160]   come up
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.880]   and after we hear this song,
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.700]   Keith Green's song,
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.640]   and then we'll stand up
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.440]   for the closing praise.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.460]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:23.460]   Thank you.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:37.420]   Do you see,
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.960]   do you see,
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.040]   do you see,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:55.740]   all the people sinking down?
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.500]   Don't you care,
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.000]   don't you care,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.680]   are you gonna let them drown?
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   How can you be so numb
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   not to care if they come?
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.640]   You close your eyes
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.740]   and pretend
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.180]   the job's done.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.680]   Oh, bless me, Lord,
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.080]   bless me, Lord,
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.800]   you know,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.840]   it's all I ever hear.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.680]   No one aches,
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.120]   no one hurts,
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.840]   no one even sheds one tear.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.400]   But he cries,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:32.980]   he weeps,
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.060]   he bleeds,
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.900]   and he cares for your needs.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.680]   And you just lay back
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.140]   and keep soaking it in.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:46.700]   Oh, can't you see,
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.460]   it's such a sin.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.740]   Cause he brings people
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.800]   to your door
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.480]   and you turn them away
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.240]   as you smile and say,
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.000]   God bless you,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.220]   be in peace,
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:06.560]   and all heaven just weep.
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.520]   Cause Jesus came
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.500]   to your door
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.300]   You've left him out
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.720]   on the streets
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.860]   Open up,
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.320]   open up
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.940]   and give yourself away
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.720]   You see the need,
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   you hear the cries
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.860]   So how can you delay?
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.540]   God's calling
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.900]   and you're the one
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.280]   But like Johnny Rock
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.480]   He's told you to speak
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.280]   But you keep holding it in
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.880]   Oh, can't you see it's such sin?
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.760]   The world is sleeping in the dark
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.420]   That the church just can't fight
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.940]   Cause it's asleep in the light
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.960]   How can't you be so dead
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.340]   When you've been so well-famed
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:13.540]   When Jesus rose from the grave
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:18.960]   And you, you can't even get out of bed
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   Oh, Jesus rose from the dead
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.340]   Come on, get out of bed
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   Come on, get out of your bed
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:38.720]   All right, let's pray
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:47.920]   Father, we eagerly wait for revival
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.460]   Help us Lord God
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.160]   Help us to see the people around us
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.220]   Who are suffering because
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.900]   Of their sins
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.840]   Because of the enemy's deception
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.760]   Where their eyes have been blinded
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.260]   Lord God
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.720]   That they do not see the glory of the gospel
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.700]   Help us Lord God as a church
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.340]   To be intercessors for them
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.780]   Not to simply put band-aids
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.300]   Lord God
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.380]   On how they feel
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.260]   But I pray that the power of the cross
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.120]   Would deliver them
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.560]   Lord God
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.460]   From the bondage
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.180]   Knowing, Father
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.060]   True freedom can only come
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.820]   When we come to you
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.380]   So we pray, Father God
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.220]   That you would help us
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:29.820]   To be a church
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.140]   Who is not ashamed of the gospel
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.640]   For knowing, Father
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.520]   It is the power of God
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.200]   Unto salvation
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.660]   To everyone who believes
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.300]   In Jesus' name we pray
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:37.860]   Amen
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.920]   Let's all stand up
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.740]   For the closing praise
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:08:05.920]   God is faithful to His word
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.580]   Even when there seems no way
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.180]   Though time may pass
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.420]   His memory will not fade
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:25.560]   His promises will never fail
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.960]   Faithful He has been
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.280]   Faithful He will be
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   Time and time again
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.260]   Time and time again
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.540]   His word returns complete
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.940]   To His truth I cling
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.680]   When the night is deep
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.680]   Faithful He has been
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.620]   Faithful He will be
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:09:00.940]   God is gracious
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.960]   God is gracious
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.900]   God is gracious
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.280]   When I doubt
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.400]   He draws near
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.120]   Though I retreat
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.000]   Though I may wander
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Through the wilderness
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   Through the wilderness
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.940]   He goes with me
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.860]   And gives me peace
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.180]   Gracious He has been
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.540]   Gracious He will be
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.880]   What I don't deserve
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.980]   The Father gives to me
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.980]   Where He leads my feet
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.520]   Where He leads my feet
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   Where He leads my feet
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.980]   I shall not want or need
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.020]   Gracious He has been
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.980]   Gracious He will be
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:10:04.040]   God is worthy
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:04.640]   God is worthy
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.580]   God is worthy
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.160]   God is worthy
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.460]   God is worthy of my song
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:18.660]   Countless are His awesome deeds
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.660]   His mighty hand
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.660]   His mighty hand
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.860]   His mighty hand
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.660]   Has parter agencies
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.660]   For those He loves
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   He has redeemed
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.660]   Worthy He has been

[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.660]   Let's pray
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.660]   Now to Him who is able
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.660]   To keep you from stumbling

[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.660]   Through Jesus Christ our Lord
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.660]   Be glory, majesty, dominion
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.660]   And authority

[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   God sent His Son

[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:54.660]   Him He lived and died
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:59.660]   To buy my pardon
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:04.660]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:08.660]   My Savior lives
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:14.660]   Because He lives

[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.660]   And life is worth the living
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.660]   Just because He lives
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660]   Just because He lives
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.660]   Just because He lives
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.660]   Just because He lives
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660]   Just because He lives
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:15:13.720]   One church, one faith, one hymn raised, God and God alone.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:26.620]   One cross, one grace, one name that saves, all praise to you belongs.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:36.260]   All praise to you belongs, we lift you high.
