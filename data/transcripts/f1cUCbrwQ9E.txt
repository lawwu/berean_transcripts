[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.820]   Sorry.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.820]   Our second announcement is that we are announcing
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.820]   the opening day of submissions
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.820]   for our sixth annual service auctions.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.820]   So if you are unaware, this is a fundraising effort
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.820]   our entire church membership body can participate in,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.820]   whether you are submitting a service or you are bidding.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.820]   The proceeds from this year's service auction
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.820]   will fully go to the Berean Mission Fund.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.820]   As in past years, church members have submitted

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.820]   and then you would fill that out on the Google form.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.820]   Please note that only active Berean members
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.820]   are eligible to participate,
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.820]   so be sure that you are a part
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.820]   of the Berean members' Facebook group
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   because that's where all the services and items
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.820]   and auction details will go once it's live,
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.820]   as it all takes place online.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.820]   The deadline for these submissions will be April 19th,

[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.820]   God has blessed you with.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   Thank you.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.820]   [applause]
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.820]   Our church needs to learn how to clap.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.820]   It's so awkward when you guys clap.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.820]   All right.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.820]   [applause]
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.820]   All right.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.820]   All right.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.820]   Next three announcements is concerning our Easter service
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.820]   that's coming up on April 20th.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.820]   We're about, I guess, almost about four weeks,
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.820]   so maybe a little bit over four weeks away.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   If you look at--you should have gotten one of these
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.820]   when you were coming in.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   So starting from April 14th to 16th,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.820]   we have Passion Week devotions happening at 730.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.820]   We do annually.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   We're just kind of walking through each day
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   as he is headed toward the cross so that we can be prepared
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.820]   for the communion, Good Friday, that's coming up.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.820]   And then on Thursday, we have a Passover meal
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.820]   that's starting at 630.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   So if you've never participated in the Passover meal,
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.820]   I strongly encourage you to come because right before Jesus
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   goes to the cross, he tells his disciples to do this
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.820]   in remembrance of me.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.820]   And so he embedded the gospel in the culture
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.820]   of the Jewish ceremony.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.820]   And so if you sit and really understand what's going on,
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.820]   for you, for your children, it's a great opportunity
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   to kind of revisit when Jesus says to do this
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.820]   in remembrance of me.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   And so if you've never participated,
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   I strongly encourage you, and even if you did participate
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.820]   and you want to bring your children again
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.820]   to remind them and to instill that in them,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   Pastor Mark will be leading that at 630.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   There is a limited space, so if you want to participate,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.820]   please sign up.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.820]   And I forgot what the charge is.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.820]   There's a nominal fee for dinner that's happening at 630.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   And then on Friday night, we have Good Friday service.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   As you guys know, each Good Friday,
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.820]   we have all the three services, and sometimes even
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.820]   our outside guests come to that service.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.820]   Our sister Susan, miraculously, were able to get
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   more parking for us.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.820]   I don't know how she does it, but she found more parking,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.820]   so we're going to have plenty of parking.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   But we do need help because this room can max fit 600.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   We're expecting about 800, 850 for that Friday.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820]   And so they're asking for parking help,
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   for ushering help, and whatever else that they need.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   So if you're willing to help that Friday,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.820]   please let Justin know.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.820]   And then obviously on Sunday morning,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.820]   we have early rise service at 8 a.m.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   We will be having breakfast right after that.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.820]   And then starting from the regular service,
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   whether it's 8 o'clock, 9.30, and 11.30,
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   there will be lunch provided.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   And so our sister Laurel has volunteered to head that up,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.820]   but they do need help.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   They need quite a few people to come on Saturday to prep
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.820]   and then Sunday to help serve.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   So if you're willing to help with that,
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.820]   if you can't do it on Friday, or you can do all of it,
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   please let Justin know, and Justin will be able
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.820]   to guide you to that.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   I think that's it.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.820]   Yes, okay.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.820]   So if you're willing, you can copy the QR code,
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.820]   or you can just contact Justin directly.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.820]   All right, let me pray for our offering,
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   and then we'll give you a minute to give.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.820]   And then again, if you brought a physical offering,
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   we have an offering box in the back that you can visit
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.820]   on your way out.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.820]   All right, let's pray.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.820]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.820]   for your continued grace and love and patience.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.820]   No matter what it is that we have been wrestling with this week,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.820]   I pray that you would help us to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   that he would be our refuge, that he would be our glory,
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.820]   he would be our joy, that our worship that we give you
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   may be sincere in spirit and in truth.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.820]   Help us, Lord God, to break away from just regular habit,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.820]   but to give you our very hearts,
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   that even this giving would be a reflection, Lord God,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   of your grace in our lives.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.820]   May it be given as an act of worship,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.820]   and may it be handled in a manner, Lord God,
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.820]   that glorifies and honors you.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.900]   So, together the name means, "My God is my pure, radiant light."
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:08.500]   And so, her brother's name kind of has a similar mold as well.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.380]   For us, two things that we'd appreciate prayers about would be,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.140]   one, obviously, for her brother and herself to, you know,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.220]   get to know the Lord at a young age.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.580]   Not just head knowledge, but have a personal,

[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.560]   and especially for my wife and I,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.620]   just for wisdom, judgment, and discernment,
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.060]   to do what is right and just, you know, before his eyes.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.840]   You know, obviously, in raising our children as well.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.940]   Earthly speaking, of course, they're our children,
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.740]   but we understand ultimately that we're just merely stewards
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.040]   of them and the lives that we've been entrusted with.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.180]   So, we want to point them, you know, in the right way as much
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.480]   as possible to the best extent we can.

[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.660]   >> Hi. My name is Brian.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.540]   This is Priscilla.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.940]   This is my son, Hayden, and that's Mia Hana Choi.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.240]   Before Hayden -- before --
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.500]   when we were pregnant, before Hayden,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.080]   we found out that he was a boy.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.880]   We really liked the name Mia,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.240]   because Priscilla really likes Fast and the Furious.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.820]   And there's only Letty and Mia as the two names
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.240]   that we could choose from.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.720]   But Mia also means beloved, and her middle name, Hana,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.960]   is in honor of Priscilla's family member who passed away,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.620]   and Hana means grace and favor by God.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.160]   So, our prayer request is
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.060]   that they both have a relationship with God,
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.760]   and that we -- me and Priscilla will be good shepherds towards
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   that goal.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.560]   Thank you.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.600]   [ Applause ]
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.180]   >> Hi, everyone.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.100]   My name is Joseph.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.300]   This is my wife, Jessica,
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.680]   and this is our daughter, Eleanor, Charlotte Lee.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.780]   And the name Eleanor means God is light,
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.220]   and that is our prayer for her, that God will be her light,
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.320]   that she will come to know him,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.180]   and that she will be a light in this world.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.680]   Thank you.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.420]   [ Applause ]
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.300]   >> Hi. My name is Sam.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.100]   This is my wife, Grace, and this is Obi.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.560]   Full name is Tobias, which means God is good.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.060]   We went with Obi because our older two are Abby and Eli,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.960]   so we wanted to just keep the three-letter ending
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.060]   in an "I" name, so -- yeah, we didn't go with Toby.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.000]   Our prayer request is for love, patience, and wisdom for us
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.080]   as parents, for all our kids, and that all our children would
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.680]   walk in the way of the Lord and come
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.080]   to know Jesus and serve him.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.880]   [ Applause ]
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.580]   >> I want to read from -- before we let them go,
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.120]   Psalm 127, it says, "Unless the Lord builds a house,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   they labor in vain.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.020]   Who built it?
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.300]   Unless the Lord guards the city,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.500]   the watchman keeps awake in vain.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.860]   It is vain for you to rise up early, to retire late,
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.200]   to eat the bread of painful labors, for he gives
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.340]   to his beloved even his sleep.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.100]   Behold, children are a gift of the Lord.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.040]   The fruit of the womb is a reward.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.780]   Like arrows in a hand of warriors,
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.700]   so are the children of one's youth.
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.540]   How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.280]   They will not be ashamed when they speak
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.780]   with their enemies in the gate."
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.420]   Part of the reason why we present our children to you is,
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.660]   again, to think about our next generation.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.120]   That's something that the older I get, the more and more urgent
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   that seems to be, that what is our church generation,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.960]   what is our church culture going to look
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.100]   like once this generation passes?
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.300]   And so more and more we think about how, you know, you guys,
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.580]   and some of you guys are young parents,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.140]   and some of you guys younger than that,
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.180]   like when you are the leaders
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.080]   of the next generation, what will it be?
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.340]   And these children are going to inherit what we labor to build.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.220]   And so, you know, the text here says that children are
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.720]   like arrows, like quivers, and a family that has full of them.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.400]   And basically, quiver basically is all the arrows
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.960]   for the purpose of war.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.800]   And so our natural thinking in our culture is to protect them.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   So we have, if we're not careful,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.340]   our church becomes a bunker mentality where we're trying
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.840]   to protect them from evil,
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.100]   but we're not necessarily preparing them to battle
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.480]   because that's exactly what they're going to do.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.780]   We are increasingly living in a culture
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.040]   where they're hostile toward the faith of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.660]   And so if we train our children to be safe in bunkers,
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.360]   that's all they're going to know.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.060]   And so the text that we're looking at,
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.920]   and part of the reason what we're doing is all the teachers,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.200]   parents, the church, to prepare them not only to be protected
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.660]   from the evil, but to be able to fight against it.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.760]   When he says I will build my church and the gates
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   of Hades will not be able to fight against it,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.940]   is that they would be the next generation people who are going
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.380]   to stand up for the truth, the gospel, for what we believe.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.740]   And so everything that we work
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.540]   for this generation will not end with us.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.420]   That it will be inherited by these young children,
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.880]   and that for many years to come,
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.280]   that they will continue to do the work.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.560]   And so for that end, we're going to pray for the parents.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.920]   We're going to pray for you, so all the teachers
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.100]   who are laboring on behalf, watching the children,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.900]   that that would be the mindset of our church,
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.540]   that we prepare them, share the gospel with them,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.540]   we teach them so that they may be ready
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.040]   against the hostile culture that we live in, and to glorify God.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.080]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll dismiss them.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.180]   >> Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.580]   for allowing our young families, Lord God,
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.480]   to experience the joy of having children.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.260]   Lord, we live in a culture where there's more
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.520]   and more hostility, Lord, toward having children,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.700]   just generally, Lord God, and just attack on their mindset
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.340]   and what they are thinking.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.700]   Help us as parents, especially the parents who are here,
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.580]   as each one of them are praying, Lord God,
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.840]   that their children will come to faith.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.720]   Help them to disciple them, to set an example for them,
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.280]   what it means to love you,
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.580]   what it means to live out their faith truly,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.120]   and that their children would inherit the faith
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.220]   of the parents, Lord God, from an early age,
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.060]   that you would bless these homes, that these children,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.660]   even from a young age, Lord God, would be able to discern truth,
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.160]   to be able to confess their sins, to be forgiven,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.860]   and for many, many years to come,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.040]   that they would be the defender of the gospel and the truth.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.600]   They would proclaim who you are wherever they go,
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.640]   whatever arena that you send them.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.300]   So we pray for that purpose, that our church,
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.240]   not just these families, but our whole church, Lord God,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.940]   would endeavor together, would commit together
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.820]   to raise up children, Lord God,
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.080]   who will be your warriors in your kingdom.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.380]   So we thank you, Lord God.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.060]   We lift all these children, all these parents to you.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.420]   All right. Thank you.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:52.000]   All right. If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 10.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.960]   I'll be reading from verse 38 to 42.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.400]   Okay. Luke chapter 10, verse 38 to 42.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.840]   I'm reading out of the NASB.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.280]   "Now as they were traveling along, he entered a village,
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.940]   and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.680]   She had a sister called Mary who was seated at the Lord's feet,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.380]   listening to his word.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.880]   But Martha was distracted with all her preparations,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.920]   and she came to him and said, 'Lord, do you not care?
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   My sister has left me to do all the serving alone.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.720]   Then tell her to help me.'
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.760]   But the Lord answered and said to her, 'Martha, Martha,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.200]   you are worried and bothered about so many things,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.160]   but only one thing is necessary,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.200]   for Mary has chosen the good part,
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.300]   which shall not be taken away.'"
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.700]   Father, we pray for your guidance.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.340]   We pray for the truth of your word to hit our hearts,
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.820]   to guide us, lead us, and encourage us.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.420]   Help us to hear your voice and your voice alone.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.020]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:51.060]   You know, typically when we survey the church,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.200]   you know, the most common complaints
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.220]   that we hear in the church that I have,
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.860]   teeters back and forth depending on who we ask.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.960]   There's some of you who will say,
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.900]   you know, our church is a little bit too legalistic.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   You know, we had a dating seminar yesterday,
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.780]   and we gave, like, this is, you should take it seriously,
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.540]   you should prepare for marriage, you should seek counsel.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.880]   And I know that there are some of you,
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.920]   just because I know, I hear it through the grapevine,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.280]   our church is too legalistic.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.580]   We need to be more gracious.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.560]   Why do we have to get involved with other people's lives?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.880]   You know?
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.560]   And then there's some of you who are in this room
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.960]   and say, legalistic?
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.520]   You know, we're not strong enough.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.120]   You know, we're allowing too much.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.320]   We're too liberal in here.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.600]   We're just allowing people just to do whatever,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.040]   and we need stronger discipleship.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.860]   And depending on who we talk to,
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.040]   you're gonna have different opinions,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   and some very polarizing opinions.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.320]   You know what's interesting is,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.800]   years ago we were at Together for the Gospel,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.640]   and I think I mentioned the wrong name.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.960]   I said Albert Mohler in the first service,
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.800]   but I think he was, I'm pretty sure it was R.C. Sproul.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.680]   He basically outlined 2,000 years of church history,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.200]   of the pendulum shifting back and forth
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.480]   from holiness movement to grace movement.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.080]   And I forgot how many different eras that he mentioned,
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.920]   but there are maybe about 15 to 17 different swings
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.800]   that he kind of, you know, was telling us about.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   This is what happened.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.520]   And each stage, they see an issue,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.340]   and then they would combat that issue,
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.240]   and they would swing, you know,
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.960]   to correct an error that they see,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.000]   and then they would correct it all the way to the other side,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.840]   and then that would cause a problem,
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.520]   and then they would swing the other end back and forth.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.200]   Just in the short time that I've been a Christian,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.720]   the last 40 years, I've seen the pendulum shift
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.480]   probably about three or four times.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.880]   I've mentioned many times, I became a Christian in 1983,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.600]   and it was at the tail end of the Jesus movement.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   So all the people that was influential to me
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.120]   were saved in the '70s,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.520]   and they were part of the Jesus movement.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.720]   And so if you don't know about the Jesus movement,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.120]   is Calvary Chapel was at the center of this,
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.980]   and people came to faith,
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.960]   and so they got rid of the traditional worship.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.320]   You had hippies who were coming into church with barefoot,
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.240]   you know, long hair, doing drugs, just coming up.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.780]   So a lot of the Calvary Chapel pastors were teenagers,
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.240]   or in their 20s, coming out from the Vietnam War,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.680]   who got converted.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.600]   And so that was part of the Jesus movement.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   So when I became a Christian,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.560]   all I heard was Jesus loves us unconditionally,
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.060]   that, you know, Christians are not perfect, just forgiven.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.880]   And so that was kind of like the mantra.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.980]   And then the '80s hit, and they said, you know what?
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.480]   The church is getting a little bit too loose.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.800]   We need to have more discipleship.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.240]   So back in the '80s, if you became a Christian
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.080]   in the latter part of '80s,
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.800]   there was a strong holiness movement,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.520]   discipleship movement.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.680]   So the campus ministries were heavily influenced
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.280]   by the navigator movement,
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.020]   started having emphasis on discipleship,
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.100]   that we need to be disciplined.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.940]   This kind of free, cheap grace type of thing,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.000]   we need to combat this, and the pendulum started to shift.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.180]   And so if you became a Christian,
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.380]   or you experienced Christianity during the mid to late '80s,
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.440]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.720]   There was a very strong emphasis on discipleship
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.780]   during that period.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.280]   And after that, there was like, oh, you know what?
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.120]   This is too legalistic,
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.420]   and people are getting hurt from this.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.920]   And so the seeker-friendly movement,
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.120]   charismatic movement started shifting and coming in,
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.400]   saying that we need to focus on grace.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.800]   They're so concerned about the younger generation leaving,
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.480]   and they were, I'm reading articles left and right
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.000]   about the exodus of the young generation.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.120]   And then you hear stories about the seeker-friendly,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.040]   market-driven churches who are going out
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.520]   and redefining what the church's service is.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.960]   And so getting rid of all traditionalism,
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.760]   and just kind of breaking the church down into bare bones
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.640]   so that more and more people would be attracted
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.360]   to the church, and that was the seeker-friendly movement.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.080]   Well, tail end of the seeker-friendly movement,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.120]   people began to notice that, you know what?
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.080]   There's no depth in here.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.100]   The Bible's not being taught.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.560]   And so the young, restless and reform movement came,
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.080]   and that was happening in the early 2000s.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.480]   And so early 2000, the young, restless and reform movement,
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.920]   all of a sudden, the younger generation started to say,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.680]   you know, I'm a Calvinist, and I believe in election.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.640]   I want to study the Bible.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.400]   The church should practice church discipline.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.360]   And I was a pastor during that time,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.960]   and I was pretty amazed that just all of a sudden,
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.540]   there was this hunger for the Word of God.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.040]   And the young, restless and reform,
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.480]   we want deep teaching.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.400]   We want seriousness.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.440]   And then at the tail end of that, again,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.400]   to noticing that maybe we've gone a little bit too far,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.960]   and then the gospel-centered movement came in.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.360]   That it's all about the gospel.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.720]   It's not about moralism.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.000]   It's about what we do.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.200]   It's what he's done, and he had these cliches
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.280]   that had been thrown around.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.180]   And so maybe we're still kind of lingering in that part.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.240]   And so just even in the short time
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.080]   that I've been a Christian,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.280]   I've seen this pendulum shift back and forth
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.040]   to holiness, to grace, to holiness, to grace,
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.560]   to holiness, to grace.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.800]   Well, how do we recognize that we're balanced?
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.880]   Even in this church, if I ask a group of people,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.040]   we may have different opinion.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.000]   One very polarizing opinion,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.360]   we're too gracious and we're too loose
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.960]   to, you know, we're not strong enough.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.720]   All of this is an introduction to the text that we're at.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.800]   Because the previous passage,
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.400]   remember, the lawyer asked Jesus,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.160]   "How do you inherit eternal life?"
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   And Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.360]   "with all your soul, mind, and strength."
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.500]   And then he gives an example of the Good Samaritan.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.280]   It wasn't the priests, it wasn't the Levite,
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.760]   but the Good Samaritan that they thought
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.380]   was the worst of sinners.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.000]   That God was gonna judge them first,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.320]   even before the Romans.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.120]   And then he uses them as an example,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.080]   how that person was more obedient to Christ.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.280]   That he was the one who was practicing the Shema
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.200]   better than the Levites and the priests.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   And then he ends it by saying, "You go do the same."
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.080]   So stop talking about loving God.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.320]   Stop talking about loving others.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.640]   Go do the same.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   That's how it ends.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.120]   And then we come to this text,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.080]   very next passage, Martha is doing.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.220]   Martha is serving.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.960]   And you would think there would be
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.280]   commendation for Martha.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.540]   Instead it said, "Martha, Martha,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.560]   "you are distracted about so many things,
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.340]   "and Mary has chosen what's best.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.480]   "Calm down."
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.440]   If we saw these two texts separately,
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.900]   depending on, say, you may,
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.860]   if you think that we're a little bit too loose,
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.100]   you may have loved last week's passage.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.740]   Like, we need to work.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.220]   We need to just stop talking about love,
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.920]   and we need to actually apply it.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.460]   And then maybe some of you may gravitate
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.780]   toward this passage.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.540]   There's too many Marthas in this church.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.100]   You know, we need to be Marys.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.560]   We need to sit at Jesus' feet and listen.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.100]   Well, if we're not careful,
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.080]   and part of the reason why we try to study
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.220]   the whole counsel of God
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.180]   is because the same Bible that tells us
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.540]   if you love your father and mother more than me,
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.660]   you cannot be my disciple,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.260]   the same Bible tells us
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.280]   that if you do not honor your father and mother,
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.580]   you cannot live long and prosperous.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.620]   God's blessing comes from honoring your father and mother.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.120]   So which text is true?
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.960]   Obviously, both of them is.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.240]   But when we're in the flesh,
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.480]   we naturally gravitate toward whatever
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.680]   fits into what we want to hear.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.720]   And so we end up highlighting
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.880]   certain parts of the passage
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.160]   that fits our narrative,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.920]   and then we kind of minimize the things
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.900]   that may not fit.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.600]   And it's not safe for us
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.620]   to simply highlight certain things
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.300]   that make sense to us,
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.620]   that the whole counsel of God
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.180]   needs to be understood in its totality,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.460]   and not just bits and parts.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.180]   So I'm saying all of this
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.420]   to introduce the text to you
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.980]   because there's a reason why Luke
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.700]   ends the previous passage
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.580]   by saying, "Go do it,"
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.340]   and then in this passage he says,
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.740]   "Hey, you're worried about too many things," right?
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.960]   We are very familiar with the story
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.400]   about Mary and Martha, right?
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.600]   Mary has chosen what is good.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.280]   Some of your translations said what is best,
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.680]   and Martha, you're worried about too many things, right?
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.520]   Even before I say anything,
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.080]   if you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.960]   you've probably heard multiple sermons about this, right?
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.600]   This is for my own benefit, okay?
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.520]   I'm gonna ask you.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.440]   I asked you the first generation,
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.680]   I'm gonna ask you.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.560]   How many of you relate more with Martha?
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.400]   You're like the doer, right?
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   Honestly, raise your hand high.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.080]   I wanna see, this is,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.720]   I'm gonna keep a record of this, okay?
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.880]   Raise your hand if you're Martha, okay?
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.060]   Or you relate to Martha.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.740]   How many of you relate to Mary?
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.720]   Okay, a few of you.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.840]   And the rest of you are completely lost.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.440]   You have no idea who you are, okay?
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.600]   Let me do it again, okay?
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.580]   You have to choose one.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.080]   You have to choose one, okay?
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.400]   If you wanna be an A student,
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.200]   you have to choose one, okay?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.640]   Are you a Martha or are you a Mary?
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.480]   If you're more of a Martha,
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.240]   not completely a Martha, okay, raise your hand.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.960]   Raise your hand, okay?
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.240]   But if you're more of a Mary, raise your hand.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.600]   More of a Mary.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.560]   Okay, that's what I thought, okay?
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.400]   There's still some of you who are raising your hand,
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   but predominantly, more people relate with Martha.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.200]   Predominantly, you're right.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.240]   And this is what we see, right?
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.000]   Because Marthas are celebrated.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.960]   Some of you who said you're Mary,
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.800]   okay, and I'm not saying,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   'cause I'm not talking about anybody specific, right,
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.000]   but how many of you are really Marys?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.720]   How many of you are really like, you know what?
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.880]   I just love being at Jesus' feet.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.680]   You're not Mary just because you don't like to work.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.280]   That's not Mary.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.480]   That might be Lazarus.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.720]   That's not Mary, okay?
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.480]   Okay.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.880]   Mary is gravitating, okay,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.520]   and we're gonna be talking about that a little bit,
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:00.200]   but I would say, not just in the church,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.600]   just generally in society,
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.360]   I think more people will say I tend to be a Martha.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.760]   And the reason why is because you have to get things done.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.960]   If you want to get an A, you want to go to a good school,
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.800]   you want to get a good job.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.600]   And so if you are a functioning, good citizen,
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.240]   member of the church, any society, in a family,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.640]   and if you want to get praised,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.560]   the Marthas are the one who gets praised.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.680]   Marthas are the one who climb the ladder.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.840]   Marthas are the one who become leaders.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:32.280]   And so our natural inclination, including myself, is Martha.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.080]   So what Jesus says to Martha is something
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   that we really need to pay attention to.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.320]   There's three, I divide it into three Ds,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.400]   just for the sake of memorizing.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   Doing, distraction, and then disgruntled, right?
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.600]   That, basically this text described,
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.380]   Martha doing, distracted, and then disgruntled.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.520]   First it introduces Martha to us
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.760]   that she welcomed Jesus into the home.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.200]   Now, you have to understand that this Marian, Martha,
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.680]   is the brother of Lazarus, where John chapter 11,
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.260]   Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead, and they're in Bethany.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.640]   Bethany is about two miles away from Jerusalem.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   So we don't know exactly how many times
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.880]   he stops over at this house,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.480]   but we know that this was a base,
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.200]   that before he enters into Jerusalem,
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.080]   because he knows that hostility waits for him in Jerusalem.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.360]   He knows that the enemies,
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.880]   the people who want to crucify him and nullify him,
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.320]   are concentrated in Jerusalem.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.280]   So it seems like this home was a very prominent home
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.180]   that Jesus would visit.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.280]   Before he enters into battle, he preps,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.300]   and that's exactly what he does in John chapter 11,
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.040]   before he heads to Jerusalem,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.880]   that he has his last public miracle
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.360]   in raising Lazarus from the dead,
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.600]   and then he goes into Jerusalem
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.440]   and cleanses the temple on Monday.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.280]   So this is a very prominent home,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.040]   and you also have to understand
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:05.920]   that Jesus lived during a period of Asian-Americans.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.200]   Okay, so I know we're not all Asian-American,
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.760]   but predominantly we're Asian-American.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.940]   You have a leg up in understanding the Bible,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.240]   and I remember when this was revealed to me in seminary.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.600]   I said, "Wow, this is awesome,"
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.160]   because the Hebrew culture is generally an Asian culture,
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.440]   very hierarchical, honoring the leaders and the elders
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.680]   and family-oriented.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.600]   And then you have the Greek culture, who is Western.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.960]   So much of the Western world gets their culture,
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.440]   even the law system, philosophy, educational system
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.060]   comes from the Greeks.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.980]   So the Western world was influenced by the Greeks.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   So the early Jews were right in the middle.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.600]   So the older school generation spoke Hebrew.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.840]   The younger ones were speaking Greek.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.400]   Predominantly, the spoken language at that time was Aramaic.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.780]   Aramaic is, and this is oversimplification,
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.400]   but just so that we can remember,
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.280]   Aramaic is like Congolese or Chinglish.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.240]   It's a mixture of Hebrew and Greek.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.020]   And so that was a language that the disciples
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.720]   typically spoke.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.140]   If you wanted to engage the secular world,
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.460]   you'd have to speak Greek or Koine Greek,
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.660]   or if you wanted to engage the old generation
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.380]   or understand the Old Testament and stuff,
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.920]   you have to kind of have some Hebrew.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.940]   Now, I say all of this to kind of give you
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:39.020]   a cultural background of this time,
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.820]   that when Jesus came into town,
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.220]   that preparing for Jesus to come,
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.840]   again, this is not only of Asians.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.000]   This is true in every culture,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.760]   but in particular in an Asian culture.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.120]   You can't just have an honored guest like Jesus
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.020]   coming into your home without preparation.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.040]   If you knew that the possible Messiah
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.080]   is coming to your home and using it as a base,
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.680]   everything in your schedule is gonna be cleared out.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   You have to get this ready.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.000]   You have to cook the best food, right?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.240]   You have to clean the house.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.960]   You have to make sure that everything is prepared.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   And so Martha is doing what any guest should have been doing.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.200]   So the problem wasn't what she was doing.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.000]   It was why she was doing this.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.360]   She would have been prayed.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.200]   We heard nothing.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.440]   If Martha never said anything,
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.020]   Jesus came into town, and we just saw a picture
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.600]   of Martha preparing everything,
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   and Mary just sitting there.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.200]   Our natural conclusion is, oh, Mary's lazy.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.360]   She's so selfish, right?
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.720]   Martha's taking care of everything.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.920]   We would have said that.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.040]   Only because of the interaction between Jesus,
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   we're looking at this and say,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.120]   hey, this needs to be corrected.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.700]   So it wasn't necessarily what she was doing,
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.760]   but it was why she was doing it and what she says.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   So the second part of it, doing, to distract it,
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.920]   it says Mary was distracted in what she was doing.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.120]   The word distracted is translated to be pulled away,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.920]   to be anxious or preoccupied,
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.660]   or in some translations, dragged away.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.640]   She was dragged away.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.120]   She was worried and concerned.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.700]   She was so concerned about all these other things
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.440]   that she was missing the core.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.420]   I think any Martha would understand this.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.280]   You know the people who are the most guilty of this
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.620]   in the church are the church leaders, are the pastors,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.240]   'cause we're so busy taking care of the church
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.920]   and doing our job and preparing sermons.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.700]   We're in front of the Bible all the time
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.840]   that we are so focused on feeding other people
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.480]   that we forget to feed ourselves.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.200]   I don't know how many times I go to a church
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.120]   and I preach during a retreat or something
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.560]   and the pastor's not in the room.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.960]   He's so busy taking care of the food,
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.800]   making sure all the rides are taken care of,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.240]   all the rooms, especially in a smaller church,
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.120]   and he doesn't get to hear any of the sermon
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.680]   'cause he's always busy, he's always,
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.620]   and usually it's the pastor and oftentimes the wife.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.640]   And so at the end of the retreat,
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.280]   you sit down and they're exhausted and they're tired
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.360]   'cause they poured themselves out,
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.260]   but they themselves did not receive.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:28.600]   This is the typical scene of a Martha
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.320]   who is diligently serving,
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.280]   but they're distracted, they're anxious,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.380]   they're dragged away.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   The Bible warns us over and over again
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.120]   where if we are laboring and serving with our own energy,
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:43.960]   we get burned out.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.840]   And I talked about this many times before,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.720]   burnout basically means,
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.680]   it doesn't mean that you're overworked.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.120]   We typically think if we work too hard,
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.440]   we're gonna get burned out.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.920]   It's not the work that burns you out,
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.040]   it's the fuel that you work with that burns you out
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.520]   if you don't have enough.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.800]   There are people in this room
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.560]   who is preparing for the Rogner race.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.520]   If you guys know what that is.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.560]   Well, you run what?
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.480]   10,000 miles or you just,
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.200]   I don't know why you're doing that.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.640]   I don't understand you,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.600]   but you guys are excited, right?
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.120]   And you're preparing.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.320]   And you say, "Oh, how much are you running?"
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.680]   "I'm running 18 miles."
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.480]   Like, I'll get burned out running to my car from here.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.160]   But for whatever the reason,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.520]   so it's not like, why did you volunteer?
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.040]   Nobody, what do you get out of that?
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.680]   Other than the sense of accomplishment.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.160]   For whatever the reason, you find joy in running,
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.760]   which I don't get.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.440]   So it's like, well, you don't get burned out?
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.920]   It's like, no, they do it.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.240]   They're thinking about tomorrow and the next day, right?
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.840]   It's not the amount of work that burns us out.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.880]   It's why we're doing that.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.120]   What we're doing it with.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.720]   If we, the Bible constantly warns us
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.480]   that what God has called us to do
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.240]   is not something that we can do by our own strength.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.320]   Paul says in Philippians 2, 12 to 13,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.240]   "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed,
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.200]   "not only in my presence, but much more in my absence,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.520]   "work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.080]   Now, we all know that text, right?
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.760]   Now that God saved you and justified you,
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.320]   now work it out with fear and trembling.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.400]   But if you forget the second part,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.680]   this is where you get into trouble.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.240]   "For it is God who works in you,
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.280]   "both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.720]   He didn't just say work out your salvation
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.400]   with fear and trembling, he says to do that
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.880]   because God is working in you.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.760]   God is the one who's empowering you.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.480]   In Colossians 1, 29, Paul says,
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.200]   "For this purpose also I labor,
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.520]   "striving according to his power,
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.440]   "which mightily works within me."
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.840]   So if you're a Martha and you're running around
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.280]   because you feel like sense of duty
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.920]   and you need to do this, you need to do that,
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.200]   but his power is not what's motivating you.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.760]   There's no work and renewal and refreshment
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.280]   that's happening in you, but you're just doing it
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.160]   because you're a good student.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.680]   You learned how to climb up the social ladder,
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.240]   you're a good citizen, you're a good church member,
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.920]   and so you're used to getting A's as students,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.680]   so now you're trying to get A's in the church.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.280]   And so you know how to work hard,
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.120]   you know how to fix things, you know what the problem is,
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:26.120]   but his work in you is not refreshing you.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.040]   You know, in Acts chapter one, four,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.960]   after the disciples fail,
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.320]   and then Jesus restores them back,
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.880]   "Do you love me more than these?"
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.000]   He said, "Then feed my sheep,"
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.760]   and then Jesus is about to ascend,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.240]   and then Jesus tells them, "Wait."
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.600]   In verse four, gathering them together,
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.320]   he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.360]   but to wait for what the Father had promised,
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.520]   which he said, "You heard of from me."
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.480]   He said, "Wait."
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.120]   Don't go yet, you're not ready.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.320]   The disciples said, "Okay, we failed the first time,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.280]   "we're not gonna do this again."
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.400]   He's like, "By your own strength, you're gonna fail.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.240]   "You just wait."
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.640]   And then he says, in chapter one, verse eight,
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.240]   "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.120]   "you will receive power.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.440]   "Then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.440]   "Judea, Samaria, to the remotest part of the world."
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.120]   He wasn't depending on them.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.240]   He's going to use them,
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.420]   but he said, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.560]   "it's not your education, it's not your experience.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.160]   "Since you failed before, now you're ready."
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.040]   He said, "No, in the flesh, you're gonna fail
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.000]   "10 times, 100 times."
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   He said, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   "you will receive power."
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.400]   So the power is not in you.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.020]   The power is not in your education.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.600]   The power is not in your experience.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   He said, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,"
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.920]   and he doesn't say, "Try to be my witness."
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.480]   He says, "You will be my witness
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.040]   "when the Holy Spirit is upon you."
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.920]   That's why the Scripture is filled.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.320]   Walk in the Spirit, love in the Spirit.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.240]   To be in the Spirit in everything, he said,
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.640]   to be filled with the Spirit,
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.560]   because it's the Spirit that's going to carry you along.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.120]   In fact, in Mark chapter four, 18 to 19,
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.640]   when Jesus tells us about the different soil,
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.360]   the first one falls into the ground,
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.500]   the devil comes and snatches it away, it disappears.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.340]   The second one goes into rocky soil,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.440]   it bears fruit a little bit
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.840]   because it has no foundation, it also dies.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.560]   But the third soil, he says this,
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.040]   other than the one whose seed has sown among the thorns,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.680]   these are the ones who had heard the word,
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.320]   but the worries of the world, deceitfulness of riches,
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.440]   and the desires of other things enter in
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.360]   and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.960]   You notice here, he doesn't say they get caught in sin.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:43.000]   He doesn't say they got caught in to heresy.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.120]   The third soil just got distracted.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.800]   They became anxious.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.700]   And so he said that their anxiousness and their distraction
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.720]   that dragged them away from what is most important
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.960]   choked the word in their life, and then they die.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.260]   They don't bear fruit.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.520]   So you have to understand how important this is,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   because with good meaning, with good intentions,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:18.860]   our biggest fight oftentimes is distraction, distraction.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.360]   We're so busy wanting to do great things
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.720]   for the kingdom of God, that in the midst of that,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.300]   that we fall into the same trap as Martha.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.200]   Because we're busy, because we're working,
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   because we're laboring, because we're sacrificing,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.160]   but in the midst of that, what does it lead to?
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.400]   Because she was distracted, what does it say?
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.560]   She became disgruntled, because that's what it leads to.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.080]   If you're working hard with the wrong motive,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.680]   with the wrong fuel, eventually you become disgruntled,
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.880]   and that's exactly what Martha became.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.440]   In the midst of doing all that work,
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.720]   you would think if Jesus came into town,
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.980]   the Messiah is coming to your home.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.720]   You would think the natural inclination is like,
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.680]   Jesus is coming into town, thank you for visiting my house.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.460]   I get to serve my Messiah.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.840]   Instead, because she was disgruntled,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.200]   she's first disgruntled with Mary.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.600]   So she's doing all the work, and she's busy,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.240]   and bitterness is starting to rise in her.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.120]   I'm doing all the work, and she's looking over
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.960]   in the corner of her eye, and Mary's just sitting there.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.520]   And so she's bitter at Mary, and this is what happens
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.320]   with a lot of people who serve hard in the church.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.000]   They're laboring, and then all of a sudden,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.760]   their laboring turns into, why aren't they helping?
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.480]   Why aren't they doing that?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.080]   And so all the good work that you do
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.220]   turns into being disgruntled and grumbling.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.160]   And instead of serving to worship God,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.840]   it becomes a source of contention, bitterness,
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.720]   anxiousness, and division in the church,
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.440]   because your hard work leads to grumbling,
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.480]   because you get burned out in the context of serving.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.960]   That's what has happened to Martha.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.360]   But here's the kicker.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.760]   Not only was she disgruntled with Mary,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.200]   as soon as Jesus, the Messiah, comes into town,
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.640]   what does she say?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.560]   Do you not care?
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.240]   Do you not care?
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.880]   Think about the context of this.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.200]   Jesus forfeited glory.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.960]   The king of kings and lord of lords forfeited his glory,
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.600]   was born in humiliation.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.240]   For 33 years, he walked as a servant,
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.760]   and now he's headed to the cross.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.440]   He's about six to eight months to go to the cross
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.240]   to suffer for her,
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.440]   to take all her sins, past, present, and future,
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.000]   to take it upon himself, and this pain that he bore.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.240]   My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.440]   And he was gonna do this for her.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.160]   And then she says, don't you care?
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.480]   I mean, when you put it like that,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.980]   it's like what she said, do you not care,
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.160]   it sounds ridiculous.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.040]   I remember when my children were young,
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.160]   very young, we took 'em to Disneyland, okay, yes.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.520]   And we took 'em to Disneyland, right,
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.400]   against all our good sense.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.040]   'Cause our kids are young, they wanted to go,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.440]   and at that time, we didn't have much money,
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.600]   so going to Disneyland was a big, big deal.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.320]   So we sacrificed, and Esther loves Disneyland
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.200]   as much as I do, right?
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.840]   So neither of us are fans, but we did it for our children.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.440]   So we spent all day staying there.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.920]   We're gonna be here, we spent a lot of money,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.320]   so we're gonna milk it as long as possible.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.960]   Waited until the fireworks, and pew, pew, pew,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.340]   you know, all that was done.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.960]   We're coming home, and then we said, you know what,
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.200]   you guys want some jamba juice?
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.720]   Let's end this night with a treat.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.940]   So we stop by Jamba Juice, and the kids are too young,
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.560]   so they can't drink the whole thing by themselves,
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.120]   so we got a big, big one, and then we split it
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.800]   into three cups.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.260]   This is before Isaiah's born.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.080]   But we didn't split it perfectly, at least to them.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.520]   So an argument broke out.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.440]   This is on the way from Anaheim.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.000]   We stopped by, got jamba juice, we put it in three cups,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.960]   and all we are hearing in the backseat is, it's not fair!
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.880]   Zachary got too much.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.800]   Faith got a little bit more than me.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.340]   Jeremy has a little bit more than me.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.440]   Why does he get more than me?
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.600]   So they started arguing.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.400]   I'm driving, but I'm just dead tired,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.920]   and we just emptied our bank account.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.680]   We paid, what, $15 for churros.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.720]   You know, we're driving back home, and we're just tired.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.160]   It's like, oh, you know, we're good parents,
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.660]   and we took good care of them.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.640]   And the whole time, I was like, every ounce of energy
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   I had to hold myself back, to grace and love and mercy.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.940]   You know, it's like, are you kidding?
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.760]   After the whole day of that, and you're gonna go to bed
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.520]   saying it's unfair?
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.380]   It's unfair because you didn't get enough jamba juice?
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:15.200]   (congregation laughing)
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.640]   I'm still frustrated.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.560]   (congregation laughing)
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.100]   It was like 20 years ago.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.040]   (congregation laughing)
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.440]   If you look at the context of what Martha is saying,
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.480]   how ridiculous that sounds, Martha is saying that
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.680]   before the cross.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.200]   We say that post-cross.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.560]   We know exactly what he did.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.800]   We have his words.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.660]   We know exactly what he suffered.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.280]   That God demonstrates his own love toward us,
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.100]   and that while we were yet sinners,
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.680]   he deliberately, willfully walked to the cross
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.000]   to take our sins, and then on this side,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.200]   when we don't get what we want,
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.440]   when God doesn't answer our prayer,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.600]   if life doesn't turn out exactly the way we want it,
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.000]   and say, do you not care?
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.160]   Where are you?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.280]   Now, when you see it in that context,
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.700]   you can see what the danger is with Martha.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.860]   That she's working and laboring so hard,
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.520]   but it turns into grumbling and complaining
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.720]   to the very one who came to sacrifice everything for her.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.880]   And if we're not careful,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.000]   that's exactly what happens to us.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.760]   That the ones who are laboring and struggling
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.960]   and sacrificing the most,
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.120]   you will see them five, six, 10 years later,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.700]   they're the most bitter toward the church.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.160]   They're the most disgruntled.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.560]   The ones who are serving and leaders, at one point,
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.440]   are sitting in a large mega church,
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.900]   just kind of disgruntled.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.440]   Because they were laboring, and they got burnt out,
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.680]   and their burnout turned into disgruntlement,
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.880]   and disgruntlement turned into complaining.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.280]   And this is what Jesus was referring to.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.640]   On the other hand, Mary is sitting there, just quietly.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.380]   That's all, there's not a lot of explanation
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.160]   about what Mary was doing, she was just sitting.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   This was not an ordinary position for a woman at this time.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.040]   All it tells us, and Luke is just contrasting
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.160]   between Martha who was running around doing everything,
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.520]   and Mary was just planted,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.360]   and all she was doing was just listening.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.440]   She was just listening.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.720]   In fact, all throughout Scripture,
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.360]   when God wants to use somebody, he isolates them.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.580]   You know, you and I live in a generation
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.180]   where isolation is something that we dread.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.940]   I remember when Starbucks first came in,
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.020]   I couldn't understand, I think a lot of the Jubilee members
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.380]   may be able to relate, I just couldn't understand.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.760]   Coffee's been around for over 200 years.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.300]   They're gonna open up a coffee shop?
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.620]   There's a coffee shop everywhere.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.500]   And all of a sudden, it's just sort of blown up,
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.420]   and I realized it wasn't coffee that they're selling.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:04.700]   They were selling koinonia, a place for people to gather.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:10.000]   It wasn't like, oh, I drank this Starbucks coffee,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.080]   and it was the best coffee ever, changed my life.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.640]   No, I mean, it's good, and it's just coffee.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.000]   But they were selling koinonia, a place for people to gather.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.200]   There was a generation of people
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.480]   where community was beginning to break down,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.040]   and you don't know your neighbors,
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.240]   and you're working in your cubicles at home,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.840]   and so you don't have anywhere to experience community,
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.260]   and so Starbucks became a place
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.680]   where people began to gather.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.480]   So it was hard for me to understand.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.880]   When I was starting to work with the younger people
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.760]   in our church, and they would say, you know what?
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.760]   I get so distracted in the empty office,
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.280]   so I need to go to the coffee shop.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.380]   I couldn't understand.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.920]   The office is empty.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.360]   There's nobody there, there's no noise.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.320]   I mean, if you wanna work, that's where you would go, right?
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320]   No, they have to go where there's K-pop music
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.200]   happening in the background, and people are in line talking,
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.160]   other people sitting there, and even now, right?
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.800]   There's a culture where it's like, oh, I got so much to do,
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.320]   so I gotta go to the coffee shop, right,
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.840]   where there's all this noise and distraction happening.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.880]   But for whatever the reason, we live in a generation
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.280]   where being isolated and being by yourself
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   is like to be avoided like a plague.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.960]   If you look at Scripture constantly,
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.000]   God isolates his people to get their attention
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.320]   so that they would listen.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.920]   Abraham was called from Ur of the Chaldeans
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.040]   in order to prepare him for what he had planned
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.560]   for the nation of Israel.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.120]   Moses was taken from the palace of the Pharaoh
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.800]   for 40 years in isolation,
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.480]   just spending time with the sheep in isolation.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.840]   He physically meets God in the burning bush later on
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.520]   after the 40 years, but for 40 years, he lived in isolation.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.400]   Israel wandered in the desert for 40 years.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.200]   And anybody who studied Israel history said,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.520]   when was the highlight of Israel's history?
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.800]   It was the 40 years wandering in the desert
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.960]   where God was speaking to them.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.880]   He was revealing himself to them to get up, to sit down.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.200]   Elijah was isolated in Mount Horeb,
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.120]   and God began to minister to him and speak to him.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.280]   John the Baptist was taken out into the wilderness
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.040]   in order for him to do ministry.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.760]   Jesus, to begin his ministry,
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.800]   was isolated for 40 years praying and fasting.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.000]   Apostle Paul, after he converts,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.880]   is taken out to Arabia for three years
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.040]   before he went out ever preaching anywhere.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.720]   In fact, part of the biggest problem
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.800]   that we have in church is we have people,
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.720]   and some of you have told me this.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.400]   Some of you have attended church for 10, 20, 30 years,
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.480]   and you've never understood the scripture.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.080]   It wasn't taught, or it just wasn't priority.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.640]   And so now you're learning the scripture for the first time.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.960]   Our churches are filled with people
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.080]   who are busy working, laboring,
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.000]   and sacrificing for other people,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.320]   but they have no idea what they believe.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.080]   They don't know what the scripture says.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.280]   They're not exactly sure what the church is.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.120]   They're not exactly sure and explain
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.840]   what happened at the cross.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.680]   But they're busy.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.560]   They've been busy for so long.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.240]   Because we celebrate Martha's in the church
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.760]   'cause it gets done.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.120]   The church gets claimed.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.920]   Things get done.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.480]   The church is always in need,
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.240]   so the Marthas are always welcome.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.560]   But the danger of that is
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.880]   when we're not paying attention to Christ,
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.240]   we can miss the whole point.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.880]   That's exactly what it says in Mark 8:31-33.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.440]   For the sake of time, I'm not gonna read the whole thing.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.320]   It says that Jesus was telling them
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.640]   that he's gonna go to Jerusalem,
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.000]   and then he's going to be killed
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.360]   by the priests and the scribes.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.080]   And it says in verse 32,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.040]   and he was stating the matter very plainly.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.360]   And he says this.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.400]   In the Gospel of Mark, he says this three separate times,
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.640]   and each time he says it, the disciples are,
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.600]   well, who's gonna sit on your left to the right?
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.760]   Because they were so fixated and distracted
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.840]   and dragged away by their own vision
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.200]   of what they're gonna get out of this,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.200]   but they didn't hear him.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.400]   He told them he was gonna resurrect in the third day.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.080]   But when he resurrected, they were not the ones there.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.440]   They were listening, but they weren't paying attention.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.600]   But I believe Mary was.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.480]   It doesn't tell us that,
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.200]   but in John chapter 12 verse three,
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.160]   after the resurrection of Lazarus,
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.480]   Mary, it says, took a pound of very costly perfume
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.840]   of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus,
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.400]   and wiped his feet with her hair,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.040]   and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.920]   At the minimum, we know that Mary loved Jesus.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.480]   Martha was busy taking care of all these things.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.800]   It's like, tell Mary to do, do you not care?
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.480]   This is not fair!
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.360]   Mary was there just sitting quietly, listening to Jesus.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.680]   Then as he's headed toward the cross,
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.960]   she's the one who breaks the perfume,
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   declaring her love, this very expensive perfume,
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.960]   and humbling herself, using her own hair,
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.920]   which would have been humiliating for a woman at that time,
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.840]   to wipe Jesus' feet, kissing him, adoring him.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.360]   It was really interesting
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.960]   because we saw that very scene in India.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.920]   This woman who was so thankful,
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.960]   and she got on her feet, and she was kissing the feet.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.520]   I forgot which one of our members experienced that,
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.600]   because that was their culture,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.080]   is to show that we're so thankful.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:34.000]   So we know at the minimum, she loved Jesus.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.360]   She loved Jesus.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.880]   But even more than that,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.200]   I think Judah's complaint is like,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.120]   that money could have been used to feed the homeless,
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.000]   and ultimately, it wasn't even about the homeless.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.080]   It's because he was handling the money,
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.720]   and he was kind of robbing the money back.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.720]   But this is how Jesus describes what she did.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.280]   "Therefore," Jesus said, "let her alone,
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.720]   "so that she may keep it for the day of my burial."
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.040]   Now the word keep is to watch, to guard,
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.600]   or oftentimes, obey.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.040]   It doesn't tell us that Mary fully understood.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.520]   But what Jesus says hints to the fact
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.720]   that maybe Mary knew.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.720]   What was it that Mary was listening to?
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.400]   Probably what Jesus was saying to all the disciples,
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.360]   especially knowing that this is Bethany,
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.440]   that this is where they're setting up
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.720]   to get into Jerusalem,
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.880]   and we don't know how many times he visited there,
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.880]   but this was the center that they established
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.120]   to prepare to get into Jerusalem.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.160]   So my guess is that what he was talking about
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.080]   was what he was gonna do at the cross.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.240]   She sat there, listening carefully,
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.520]   loved Jesus, and then was preparing
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.400]   for his death and burial.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.200]   Everybody was so busy taking care of stuff
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.280]   and doing stuff, and what am I gonna get out of this?
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.960]   And they're so enamored with the crowd
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.400]   that was coming on.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.880]   But Mary was sitting there quietly, listening.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.160]   Jesus says to her, Martha, Martha,
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.280]   you are worried about and bothered about so many things,
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.000]   but only one thing is necessary,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.240]   for Mary has chosen the good part
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.200]   which shall not be taken away from her.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.640]   The word good, in some of your translation,
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.800]   is translated best, superlative.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:32.680]   Oftentimes, the biggest problem in the church
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.280]   with good-intentioned people,
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.400]   working hard for the Lord,
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.880]   so distracted by what is good
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.600]   and neglecting what is best.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.640]   Distracted by what is good,
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.280]   but neglecting what is best.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.720]   And eventually, we get burned out.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.880]   Like I said, burnout is not because you worked hard,
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.000]   it's because you're working with energy
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.560]   that's not being replenished.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.480]   Only one thing is necessary,
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.400]   and Mary has chosen what is best,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.720]   and I'm not gonna take this away from her.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   I wanna conclude with this and hope it really sinks in.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.960]   God does not need us.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.080]   He wants us.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.600]   Let that sink in.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.600]   God does not need us.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.480]   He can do a better job without us.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.880]   He can get his word out better without us.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.080]   He can establish his church better without us.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.840]   He doesn't need us.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.040]   He wants us.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:42.880]   Us.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.680]   That whatever we do, he wants us, not the work.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.120]   That whatever we do, we do it as an act of worship.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.080]   We do it as an act of adoration.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.640]   We serve others because he served,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.280]   compelled by the love of Christ.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.240]   Because we love Jesus, I'm going to love these people.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.600]   He doesn't need us.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.360]   He wants us.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.000]   Let's pray.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.840]   Amen.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:15.640]   Heavenly Father,
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.520]   help us, Lord God,
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.520]   to learn what you are teaching through this text,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.760]   through Martha, through Mary,
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:31.360]   that in the midst of so many things that we do,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.480]   so many things that we're distracted by,
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.320]   so many things, Lord God, that constantly carry us away
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   from what is best.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.560]   Help us to first learn to abide in you,
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.440]   to listen to you, to adore you, to love you,
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.880]   that we may proclaim you wherever you send.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.360]   For your glory and your glory alone,
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.920]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.020]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
