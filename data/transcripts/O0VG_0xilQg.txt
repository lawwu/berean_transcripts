[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.820]   Let me get to a few announcements.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.420]   First of all, next Sunday is the all church members meeting
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.260]   that we have quarterly,
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.220]   so if you cannot make it for whatever reason,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.260]   please let us know ahead of time.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260]   And there is a fundraiser lunch
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.820]   that's happening right before the meeting
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.540]   from the Korea Mission Team,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.940]   so please stick around for that.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.180]   Family ministry picnic,
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.460]   if you're a part of the family ministry
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.860]   at all age level on May 18th from 11 to 3 p.m.,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.140]   so 11 to 3 p.m. on Sunday,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.260]   there will be a casual gathering
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.700]   at Bill Barber Park in Irvine.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.320]   So if you wish to come to that,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   you just bring your own lunch, it's a casual time.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.860]   Obviously, it's starting at 11,
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.060]   and then there's gonna be people there
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.980]   that you'll be able to meet
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.500]   and hang out and fellowship with.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.140]   So that's happening on May 18th.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.540]   Spiritual development classes.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.900]   So as you know, our weekday Bible study
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.060]   is ending this week, right?
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.220]   This is our last session.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.580]   And then we have a break in the month of,
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.180]   most of month of May,
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.700]   and then we have,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.020]   part of the reason why we're doing that
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.380]   is because we wanna address
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.220]   certain specific topics in the church.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.820]   And so during the summertime,
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.660]   there's gonna be anywhere from four to six weeks,
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.840]   depending on which class that we're gonna be offering.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.020]   Again, this is not mandatory,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.620]   but we are offering,
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.780]   hoping that many of you will take advantage of that.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.400]   And there's three courses that are gonna be given.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.940]   The dates and time are different for each class.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.300]   So you're gonna have to look it up.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.800]   It's not all at the same time.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.780]   Foundations of Marriage class,
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.680]   that's gonna be starting, I forget when,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.360]   I think it's the last week of May or third week of May.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.680]   Anyway, you could look that up.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.000]   So please sign up for that, Foundations of Marriage.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.920]   Explanations of it is gonna be more,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.820]   more detailed explanation of when you try to sign up.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.400]   And then Fourfold Disciplines of Christian Life,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.200]   where these are spiritual disciplines.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.900]   It's gonna be more of a practice than just teaching.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.400]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.360]   And then lastly, Parenting class.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.820]   I think that's happening in July, right?
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.840]   So that's happening in July.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.520]   So those are the three classes
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.240]   that are gonna be offered during the summertime.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.200]   So please look it up
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.320]   and to see which one you can take advantage of.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.680]   The Parenting class and Marriage class,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.040]   there is childcare for that.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.440]   So regular small group and regular home group
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.360]   will not be happening during the summertime.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.440]   It was gonna be happening through these classes.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.940]   So please keep that in mind, okay?
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.920]   Also, Summer Seeker group.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.520]   So this is for those of you
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.480]   who have family and friends and coworkers
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.480]   that you want to invite to take the Seeker class,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.880]   where they'll be going over the gospel,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.520]   going over answering questions.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.160]   So Pastor Mark is gonna be leading this
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.360]   on starting from May 28th to four Wednesdays consecutively
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   at 7 p.m. in the Sprouts Room.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.560]   So if you're interested in that
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.600]   and you know somebody that would benefit
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   from this Seeker class, please sign up for that as well.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.680]   And then lastly, are Men's,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   well, it's Men and Co-ed kinda softball tournament
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.200]   for mission fundraising is happening on May 24th.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.400]   So I don't know when the practice supposedly start today.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   So if you did sign up, you should have gotten an email.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.680]   There is a possibility of one co-ed team.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.720]   We're not 100% sure yet, depending on the other churches.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.800]   So if your skill level is up to it for the sisters,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.240]   for the brothers, it doesn't matter, okay?
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.520]   So whatever skill level you are,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.080]   there will be a team that is appropriate for you.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.020]   So you can sign up for that.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.520]   And that's taking place on May 24th
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.640]   at the Whittier Narrows, all day Saturday.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.480]   And then for Women, again, this is for all skill level.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.920]   Just like last year, there's going to be
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.040]   a Women's Softball Fellowship on June 8th.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.640]   So please sign up for that.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.320]   And then, so if you participated last year,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.680]   you kinda know what that looks like, okay?
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.480]   And I think that's everything for this morning.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.560]   Let me pray for the offering.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.160]   Again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.940]   we have a box in the back on the way out.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.040]   All right, let's pray.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.540]   Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:55.160]   Thank you for your guidance, your love.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.640]   Thank you for your sacrifice, Lord God, toward us,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.760]   sustaining us, orchestrating all things, Lord God,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.320]   ultimately for our benefit.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   Help us to have our eyes open, sharpened,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.840]   that we may see a greater glimpse of your glory,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.560]   that as a result, that we may change and be sanctified
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.960]   according to your purpose and will.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.440]   Help us, Lord God, to give joyfully,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.520]   that it may be multiplied, that it may be used wisely,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.120]   Father, for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.780]   (gentle music)
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.200]   (gentle music continues)

[00:28:50.920 --> 00:29:01.360]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 23,
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.440]   sorry, Luke chapter 11,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.180]   and I'll be reading from verse 14
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.780]   all the way to verse 23.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.280]   Okay.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.340]   Luke chapter 11, verse 14 through 23.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.820]   Again, reading out of the NASB.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.180]   And he was casting out a demon and it was mute.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.340]   When the demon had gone out,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.300]   the mute man spoke and the crowds were amazed.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.940]   But some of them said he casts out demons by Beelzebul,
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.180]   the ruler of demons.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.180]   Others to test him were demanding of him a sign from heaven.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.820]   But he knew their thoughts and said to them,
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.980]   "Any kingdom divided against itself, laid waste.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.660]   "And a house divided against itself, false.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.560]   "If Satan also is divided against himself,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.000]   "how will his kingdom stand?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.540]   "For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.700]   "And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.160]   "by whom do your sons cast them out?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.900]   "So they will be your judges.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.100]   "But if I cast out demons by the finger of God,
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.460]   "then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.720]   "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.240]   "his possessions are undisturbed.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.460]   "But when someone stronger than he attacks him
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.300]   "and overpowers him,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   "he takes away from him all his armor
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.940]   "on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.640]   "He who is not with me is against me.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.820]   "And he who does not gather with me scatters."
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.660]   Let's pray.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.560]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.300]   We pray for the power that you have ordained
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.440]   through these words, Lord God.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.540]   Would guide us, lead us, and open our eyes
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.460]   that we may have a deeper understanding of you.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.120]   If I can ask to put up the first,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.580]   where is it?
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.400]   Oh, there it is, okay.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.900]   So you guys know what this is.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.740]   What is it?
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:56.320]   This is your, this is a UCI mascot, right?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.020]   So I don't know about you,
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.220]   but it's one of the weirdest mascots I've ever seen.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.620]   I remember when I first heard about it,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.220]   it's like, of all the things that you could have chosen,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.020]   you chose an anteater.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.020]   And so I did some research on this
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.900]   and why anteater was chosen.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.420]   Maybe some of you guys may know this already.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.860]   But this was, it actually even has a name.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.060]   It's Peter the Anteater.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.880]   I never knew that.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.020]   All these years that I've been in Irvine,
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.900]   it actually, it has a name, Peter.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.380]   It was voted for in 1965.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.700]   The other contestants for that was an eagle,
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.780]   a unicorn, a sea hawk, and road runner.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.180]   And so of all the things that they could have chosen,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.300]   they chose anteater.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.900]   And they said they won barely by 51%.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.740]   It was a comic strip, based on a comic strip
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.660]   from BC Comics that was very popular at that time.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.260]   And that's where they got it.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.080]   So the actual, the natural question is why?
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.400]   Why is this chosen?
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.900]   What is, how many of you know the why behind this?
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.680]   Really?
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.740]   Okay, let me see if this is correct,
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   'cause I found a bunch of 'em,
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.700]   but I think this makes the most sense.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.620]   They said the reason why they voted for this
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.500]   is because back then in the 1960s,
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.400]   they said that UCI was boonies.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.020]   I visited UCI in 1985 to see some of my friends here,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.380]   and even back then, it was the boonies.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.860]   It was like, you get off the freeway,
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.820]   and there's nothing there,
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.380]   and you have to go through cow land
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.020]   and a bunch of trees to get there.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.420]   And I was thinking, who lives out here?
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.300]   And this is 1985, so I can imagine
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.740]   what it was like in 1960s.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.940]   So UCI was kind of, you say,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.140]   "Oh, I go to University of Irvine."
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.340]   And they say, "Irvine, where is that?"
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.020]   Right, and that was the typical response.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.520]   And so they were a pretty unknown school.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.980]   It was kind of out in the boonies.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.180]   It was a place where people went.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.740]   It was probably their fourth or fifth choice
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.960]   before they choose to land here.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.000]   But the reason why they went over the anteater
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.960]   is because typically anteaters are very, right,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.000]   very innocuous, harmless.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.080]   It seems like.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.000]   But they say that anteaters are very ferocious
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.620]   when they're cornered.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.660]   So if you notice that on the bottom,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.600]   this one doesn't have it,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.620]   but they have pretty sharp claws.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.640]   And then those sharp claws are very dangerous.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.920]   And typically, they're very mild,
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.380]   except when they feel cornered.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.460]   When they feel cornered, he said,
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.260]   they could be very deadly.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.820]   And the reason why they wanted to choose that
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.660]   is because UCI was kind of known as a farmland.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.720]   Nobody thinks much of it.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.860]   But if you mess with us, we're gonna get you.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.540]   And that's where the thing is zot, zot, zot, zot, right?
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   You know, you do that at the sports arena.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.540]   Zot, zot, zot is because that's the noise
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.900]   that they make when they attack, right?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.740]   I don't know if you knew that or not.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:45.500]   Still a weird choice, but that's the story behind it.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.820]   And the reason why I share that with you
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.700]   is because some of the most dangerous things
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.380]   that have happened in church history
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.880]   are from false prophets.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.740]   It's not from what's going on outside the church,
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.840]   but is within the church, right?
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   False prophets are described to us in the scripture
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.780]   as angels of light.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.860]   They come, oftentimes, representing God,
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.180]   and they are part of the church,
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.180]   sometimes, many times, leaders in the church,
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.900]   where they begin to introduce heresy into the church.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.180]   And what has harmed the witness of Christ in the church,
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.420]   oftentimes, are the false prophets.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.700]   And when they are cornered, they become very ferocious.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.040]   The text that we're looking at in the narrative,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   I know we haven't been here for a while,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.280]   but in the narrative, Jesus is heading toward the cross.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.500]   And as we can see, that as he gets closer and closer
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.420]   to the cross, he makes his intentions more and more clear.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.080]   His message has never changed,
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.280]   but he's coming out stronger
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.480]   because he's headed toward the cross.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.540]   So the opposition is also growing.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.860]   And so you can see that Jesus' rhetoric
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.900]   is becoming stronger.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.820]   He doesn't simply say,
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.940]   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.640]   He begins to say, "Woe to you, Pharisees.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.660]   "Woe to you, scribes, you hypocrites."
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:12.260]   In John 16, two to three, Jesus warns us.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.100]   "They will make you outcasts from the synagogue,
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.700]   "but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.620]   "think that he is offering service to God.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.600]   "These things they will do
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.180]   "because they have not known the Father or me."
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.540]   So today's encounter is,
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.140]   as Jesus is heading toward the cross,
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   he performs another very spectacular miracle
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.300]   and the response that Jesus gets.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   And what it is that we are to glean from this.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.420]   So the first thing that we wanna see,
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.080]   the miracle itself, right?
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.980]   The man who was mute,
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.660]   as a result of being demon-possessed,
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.420]   probably had, just like we talked about
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.820]   the other demon possessions,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.980]   they didn't know what to do with him.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.940]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.020]   Jesus comes and casts out the demon
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.060]   and he begins to talk.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.980]   And it says, basically just,
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.300]   there's not a lot of explanation.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.820]   It just tells us that it happened.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.980]   The power encounter with the demonic world
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.340]   was very common in Jesus' ministry.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.420]   There's over nine different instances
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.460]   where Jesus casts out demons.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.120]   Probably of all the miracles that he performed,
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.900]   the most common miracle was the casting out of demons.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.260]   Nine, possibly up to 12,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.440]   depending on how you count it.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.060]   If you send the disciples out
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.900]   and they cast out demons and they come out,
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.980]   if you record all of that,
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.180]   there's almost 12 of them.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.220]   Again, it is the most tangible evidence
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.620]   of what Jesus was doing.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.340]   Because the whole thing that Jesus said
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.140]   was he came to set the captives free.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.380]   Colossians 1.3, he rescued us from the power of darkness
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.340]   and brought us into the kingdom of his beloved son.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.600]   So the most tangible evidence of that
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.460]   is when he cast out demons.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.100]   Because it was a direct encounter with them.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.660]   The demonic world basically had monopoly over the sinners.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.820]   Jesus comes into the scene
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.460]   and they have no power over him
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.100]   and there's no struggle.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.880]   He just says, "Get out," and they get out.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.700]   Now that's the miracle, simple.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.860]   Not much written about that.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.500]   It just, that's what happens.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.140]   It's the response.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.580]   That's highlighted here.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.900]   Not simply the miracle.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.740]   The first response that we look at,
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.140]   it says they were amazed, just like we would be.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:33.460]   The early church is described to us in Acts 2.43
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.580]   that everyone was feeling a sense of awe
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.580]   and many wonders and signs were taking place
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.780]   through the apostles.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.780]   And so, as much as we always look at the early church
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.540]   and say, "Hey, we need to be like the early church.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.500]   "We need to be like the early church."
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.180]   Well, the early church was early church
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.100]   because they had a sense of awe.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.060]   You don't just create that from activity.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.340]   You don't just create that, that if we just study harder
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.000]   and if we organize better,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.740]   that somehow we're gonna be like the early church.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.260]   Early church was early church
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.340]   is because they were constantly encountering God.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.060]   And it was their encounter with God that caused the awe
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.580]   and it was the awe that caused them to be discipled
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.980]   and to be generous and to be bold.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:20.040]   We cannot manufacture worship.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.460]   Worship doesn't happen
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.140]   just 'cause you showed up to church early.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.140]   Worship doesn't happen
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.060]   just because you put more effort into it.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.640]   Worship is a response.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.600]   And the Bible constantly records this in the Scripture.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.340]   When people are encountered, encountering God,
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.980]   they just break out into worship.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.860]   We see it in Moses after the deliverance from Pharaoh.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.900]   There's a record of, in Exodus 15,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.140]   just him breaking out in worship.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.180]   We see it with Deborah.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.380]   When a nation of Israel, during the time of Judges,
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.460]   God delivers, she just breaks out into worship.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.940]   Hannah, when God answers her prayer and she gets pregnant
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.940]   and was able to deliver a healthy child,
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.980]   breaks out in worship.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.420]   When David is delivered from his enemies,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.660]   breaks out in worship.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   Ezra, he comes back to restore Israel,
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.100]   breaks out into worship.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.780]   Mary, when she finds out that she's pregnant
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.700]   with the Son of God, breaks out into worship.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.660]   Zechariah, when he realizes his prayers are answered,
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.580]   breaks out into worship, over and over and over again.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.580]   The Bible records people breaking out into worship
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.600]   because they're encountering God.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.740]   Worship is not something that happens
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.180]   because we get organized and we study it.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.500]   And if we disciple people better,
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.740]   that there will be greater worship.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.380]   Worship is something that happens when you encounter God.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.980]   It tells us that the first response that people gave
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.500]   was they were amazed.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.460]   Everywhere Jesus went, when they found him,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.660]   when they heard him speak, it says they were amazed
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.020]   and they were constantly in a sense of awe.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:00.180]   C.S. Lewis says in his book, The Weight of Glory,
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.580]   it would seem that our Lord finds our desires
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.900]   not too strong, but too weak.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.780]   We are half-hearted creatures,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.020]   fooling about with drink and sex and ambition.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.780]   When infinite joy is offered to us,
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.160]   we are far too easily pleased.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.700]   I think the reason why worship is weak
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.040]   is because we are so easily satisfied
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.660]   and tempted and distracted with the things of this world.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.660]   And then so, we don't have a hungering to encounter God.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.140]   Now, we want God, we desire God,
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.300]   but the passion is not there.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.260]   It's just something that happened.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.140]   This is my responsibility.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.700]   But when you lose a sense of awe
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.840]   and amazement for who God is,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.660]   it affects everything that we do.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.140]   Worship becomes just singing.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.860]   Bible study just becomes a study.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.260]   Fellowship becomes a burden.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.520]   Evangelism is just awkward.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.760]   In the early church, it was the encountering with God
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.380]   that caused the church to be the church.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.220]   So how do we, 2,000 years later,
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.980]   when we don't have miracles taking place
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.480]   every single Sunday, how do we have a sense of awe?
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.420]   How are we to come if awe and amazement
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.860]   is what produces genuine worship?
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.100]   How do we get that?
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.020]   Oftentimes, it comes in answer prayers.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.460]   If you had something that you've been praying for,
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.660]   very specifically, diligently, persevering,
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.660]   and God answers prayer, the sense of awe,
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.620]   like, wow, God answered my prayer.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.900]   Or you may, God may have used you
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.520]   to bring somebody to Christ.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.900]   And seeing somebody radically change.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.740]   You know, the Bible says,
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.460]   like, can a leper change his skin or his spots?
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.100]   Or can a sinner just change himself?
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.080]   Of course not.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.900]   So the miracle of God is when you were able
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.700]   to share the gospel when somebody comes to Christ.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.340]   Or even if you weren't you,
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.180]   you hear somebody sharing their testimony,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.220]   as we will see people being baptized.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.060]   And there's a sense of awe.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.600]   Wow, God can really change.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.780]   But the power of God, it demonstrated
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.380]   through the power of the gospel.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.100]   But the primary place where we encounter God
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.500]   is His Word.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.180]   It's His Word, right?
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.720]   Because the Bible says that He has put His breath, right?
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:39.320]   It is His very breath that's in the Word of God.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   In other words, His Spirit itself,
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.560]   these aren't just empty words,
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.160]   this is not just a record of history.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.960]   His very breath has been put into the Word of God.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.080]   So you cannot regularly encounter God
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.180]   outside of the scripture.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.560]   You may answer prayer,
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.360]   you may hear other people's testimony,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.800]   but our daily encountering with God
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.700]   is done in the Word of God.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.920]   Now, I'm not saying
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.940]   because you find something so spectacular,
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.420]   because God has invested Himself in His Word.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.980]   You remember in the Old Testament,
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   when God created Eve, Adam and Eve, what did He do?
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.520]   He says He put His very breath in them.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.960]   It was His breath that gave them life.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:25.420]   And it is that breath that died because we sinned.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.940]   We come to the New Testament,
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.640]   and God wants to put His breath back into us
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.180]   to give us life, right?
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.720]   That's why He came.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.480]   How did He say He was going to give us this life?
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.560]   He who hears my words and believes Him who sent me
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   has eternal life.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.260]   So the way that we encounter God,
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.280]   where we see a sense of awe and amazement,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.400]   is the more you understand who He is,
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.160]   the more you encounter God through the Word of God,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.040]   it creates a man and woman of worship.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.320]   All does not come to say,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.680]   oh, I never saw a demon-possessed man,
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.780]   and I didn't see somebody come back from the dead.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.400]   But when you encounter God through the Word of God,
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.320]   you really begin to see, like,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.760]   man, who else could have written this but God?
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.240]   You begin to see different aspects of who God is
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.080]   and His love and His grace and His mercy and His power,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   and that is what produces the awe.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.320]   But without that, we're trying to imitate.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.000]   We're trying to worship by singing beautifully.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.800]   We try to worship by singing loud.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.640]   We try to be sanctified by just by studying
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.760]   and knowing the Bible.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.720]   But it doesn't produce genuine worship.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.000]   Now, I'm kind of sidetracking here
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.560]   because that's the first response,
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.140]   and there's not much recorded about that
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.280]   other than the fact that they were amazed.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.020]   But it's the next two response
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.840]   that I want to spend most of the time this morning.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.200]   It's the accusation and the skeptics.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.420]   The accusation.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.040]   I mean, think about how mind-blowing this is.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.720]   This is the Son of God
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.400]   who's emptied Himself, who's walking among us
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.920]   in order to save sinners
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.800]   while we are still blaspheming His name,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.560]   and they accuse Him of being a demon.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.320]   Think about how offensive that is.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.940]   The text doesn't tell us,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.600]   at least not in Luke, who they are,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.120]   but in the parallel passage in Matthew 12, 20 to 24,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.920]   tells us it was the Pharisees.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.440]   As you guys know, the Pharisees
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.920]   were the spiritual leaders of that time.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.200]   If you asked any Jew at that time
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   who is the closest to God,
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.820]   they would have automatically said it's the Pharisees.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.500]   The Sadducees were the liberals.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.320]   They didn't believe in miracles.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.920]   They were the ones who were trying to get ahead
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.000]   by making money and connecting with the Roman government.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.620]   But the Pharisees, even the word Pharisee,
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.520]   basically means to be set apart.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.840]   They want to take the law serious.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.880]   They want to honor God.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.920]   So Pharisees were the ones that everybody thought,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.860]   if anybody knows God, it must be the Pharisees.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.960]   But the Pharisees had already gone astray.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.500]   They no longer represented God in the Scripture.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.560]   And we're going to see what leads to this.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.740]   He says, you see, some people are amazed,
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.160]   and then these Pharisees look at what Jesus is doing
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.560]   and say, you are casting out demons by the power of Beelzebub.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.800]   Beelzebub, in the Old Testament,
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.600]   literally just means Lord of the Flies.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   And by the time of Christ,
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.400]   it was just another word for Satan.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.240]   So you're casting out demons by the power of Satan.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.160]   And this was not, it's not only in the book of Luke.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   It's recorded multiple times in the book of John.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.920]   John 7.20, 8.48, 10.20.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.760]   Every time that they see something to be amazed by,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.600]   they say, well, it can't be from God.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.200]   Clearly there, he has some kind of power.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.340]   Since it is not from God, it must be from Satan.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:02.460]   Why did they say this about Jesus?
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.960]   I mean, that's the question we should naturally ask.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.400]   Like, what caused them to be this blind?
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.280]   Why is this question so important?
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.400]   Because we're not exempt.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.920]   We're not exempt.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.200]   The Pharisees were not a special group of evil people
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.640]   that existed on earth.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.080]   You know, as much as, in our society,
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.280]   if somebody is very, very evil and powerful,
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.440]   who do we say they are?
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.600]   They're Nazis, right?
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.480]   Oh, that's a Nazi, or he's a Hitler,
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.720]   because in our generation, that's the epitome.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.840]   And when we say that, we're basically saying,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.760]   oh, nothing like us.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.160]   It's like them, those people.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   We have to answer this question.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.000]   Why did the Pharisees, why were they so blind?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.720]   What caused the spiritual leaders of Israel
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.600]   standing in front of the God that created them,
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.480]   and not only did they not see them, see him,
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   as he is, but he's from Satan.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.560]   I mean, that's as far as you can go.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:24.000]   That's like saying of Michael Jordan,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.480]   he's not just a goat.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.000]   He's the worst player that basketball has ever seen.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.920]   It's one thing to say he's not a goat,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.760]   but the worst basketball player you have ever seen.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.120]   He ruined basketball.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.200]   That's how far the distinction is of who Jesus is
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.680]   and what they're saying he is.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.880]   Why, why did it get that far?
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.320]   Well, we don't have to guess,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.400]   because their own words are recorded for us.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   In John chapter 11, 47 to 50, it says,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.080]   "Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.960]   "convened the council, and were saying,
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.520]   "What are we doing?
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.480]   "For this man is performing many signs,"
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.280]   referring to Jesus.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.600]   If we listen to this, okay?
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.280]   And this is where I hope that you will be able
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.920]   to recognize how dangerous this is.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.800]   If we let him go on like this, all men will believe in him.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.200]   So their concern is that he's getting too popular.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.920]   And the Romans will come and take away
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   both our place and our nation.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.680]   But one of them, Caiaphas, who was a high priest
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.960]   at this year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.880]   "nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.400]   "that one man die for the people
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.680]   "and that the whole nation not perish."
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.800]   They're concerned that his popularity is growing,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.720]   and his growth of popularity is going to ruin them.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.360]   It's very personal.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.240]   His popularity means that they're gonna lose
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   their place in society.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.040]   And they tied that to the well-being of the nation,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.720]   because they convinced themselves
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.080]   that what's best for the nation is them rising
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.120]   and staying in power.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.960]   It sounds a lot like politics today.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.920]   Sounds a lot like what's going on today.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.720]   But the reason why they were so blind
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   wasn't because they studied the doctrine
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.440]   and they didn't fit.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.960]   It was much more personal than that.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.880]   If Jesus is who he says he is,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.520]   and he says, "Repent,
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.760]   "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.120]   You whitewash tombs.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.480]   You constantly decorate your outside,
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   but your inner person is still filled with dead men's bones.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.320]   And he kept on calling them out.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.400]   He says, "The tax collectors and prostitutes
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.080]   "are gonna get into the kingdom before you."
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.480]   So if Jesus becomes popular,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.280]   either they will have to repent and acknowledge that
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.080]   and come under his teaching and accept what he is saying,
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.600]   or they have to get rid of him.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.280]   Now, does that happen today?
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.240]   Of course.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.600]   Of course it happens today.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.560]   You know, it's interesting, in all the years
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.040]   that I've been out witnessing to people
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   in UC Irvine and different campuses,
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.840]   you know the greatest opposition to public evangelism
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.120]   was not from atheists.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.400]   It's not from other religions.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.760]   It's from nominal Christians.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.000]   Nominal Christians.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.760]   'Cause they don't want to be represented that way.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   I went to speak at a joint evangelism or gospel night
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.080]   with all the different campus ministry at UCI.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   This is years ago.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.920]   It might have even been before we started this church.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.200]   So they asked me to preach the gospel,
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.040]   and I preached the gospel.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.840]   And at that time, I was on campus at least two,
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.520]   sometimes even three times a week.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.320]   And so I shared that,
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.000]   because this was an evangelistic night,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.360]   and they brought non-Christians.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.280]   So I shared the gospel, and I shared what I was doing.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.920]   And one of the campus leaders came to me,
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.200]   and he said, "You go out on the street,
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.320]   "and you talk to strangers?"
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.800]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.080]   He said, "Don't people get offended by that?"
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.440]   I said, "Yeah, some people."
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.400]   He said, "You shouldn't be doing that."
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.160]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.760]   He said, "We shouldn't be offending people like that.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.440]   "That's not a good way to share the gospel.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.840]   "They're gonna think we're weird."
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.160]   And I said, "Who are you again?"
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.160]   And he was one of the campus leaders.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:56.000]   And I was so dumbfounded that they asked me to come
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.120]   and speak and preach the gospel to the non-Christians,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.720]   and one of the campus leaders were offended
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.200]   that I was out street evangelizing.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.080]   Now, as ridiculous as that sounds,
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.240]   the greatest opposition to the gospel
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.520]   and truth preaching are nominal Christians,
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.160]   who have created a bubble
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.560]   that they don't want the extremists to pop.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:27.240]   The Pharisees, in fact, were so hardened
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.080]   in their own heart for self-preservation.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.480]   In John 12, 10, it says this,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   "But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death."
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.320]   Lazarus to death also, because on account of him,
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.880]   many of the Jews were going away
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.640]   and were believing in Jesus.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.000]   They couldn't refute Lazarus' resurrection.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.520]   But they were so hardened in their position
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.120]   that they have to survive.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.560]   And they convinced themselves
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.520]   that this is what's best for the nation,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.000]   that even Lazarus, who came back from the dead,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.120]   that they decided they must kill him to survive.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.960]   Our desire for self-preservation
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.240]   is what causes us to be blind.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   Our desire for our reputation,
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.240]   our desire to be seen a certain way,
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.120]   our desire for our own glory blinds us.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.680]   Even in the context of preaching the gospel,
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.440]   even in the context of doing mission work,
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.360]   it is our desire to be seen that blinds us.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.080]   And when you're blind, you don't know you're blind.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.600]   Everybody else sees you're blind,
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.200]   but you don't know you're blind.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.280]   If you're not constantly buffeting your body,
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   making your slave and recognizing,
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:47.080]   there's a part of me that wants to be seen.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.920]   There's a part of me that wants the glory,
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.360]   that wants to touch that glory.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.920]   Our desire for self-preservation is what blinds us.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.000]   And that's why Jesus says,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.400]   if you want to follow me, what does it say?
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.480]   Deny yourself, pick up your cross, and come after me.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.680]   That is the first step.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.800]   Because without that, even as we follow Christ,
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.080]   we're like the disciples.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.720]   If I keep following you, what benefit do I get?
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.200]   Do I get to sit on your left or to the right?
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.840]   Who's the greatest among us?
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.520]   The whole time they were following Jesus,
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.920]   they were in their mind, they were thinking
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.640]   that somehow, some of this glory is gonna fall to me.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.560]   And because of that,
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.880]   they were completely blind to the cross.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:33.240]   These Pharisees were so committed to their self-preservation
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.120]   that they realized, as Jesus was coming closer and closer
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   to the epicenter in Jerusalem,
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.600]   that they needed to get rid of him.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.360]   And so, calling him,
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:46.480]   calling him a servant of Beelzebub
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.640]   was basically setting the theological foundation
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.240]   to get rid of him.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.040]   Or else they can't kill him.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.280]   How are they gonna kill him?
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.920]   But by the time they crucify him,
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.360]   they didn't crucify a savior,
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.560]   they didn't crucify a messiah,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.640]   they crucified a crazy man who was demon-possessed.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.200]   In their mind.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   In Psalm 1:1, it says,
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.080]   "How blessed is the man who does not walk
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.000]   "in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.880]   "nor stand in the path of sinners,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.560]   "nor sit in the seat of scoffers."
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.400]   You see the progression there?
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.800]   A man who's living by the pattern of this world,
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.400]   eventually will be counted among the sinners,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.240]   and then eventually,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.640]   you will be sitting in the seat of scoffers.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.040]   There are people in the church,
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.800]   participating in the church,
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.400]   giving in the church,
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.360]   committed to the church,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.120]   who is not committed to Christ.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:50.360]   Christ is their savior, at least by tongue,
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.800]   but he's not their Lord.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   Jesus does not have a final say in our lives.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.320]   We look for him for counsel to see if we agree.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.640]   But if we don't like it,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.320]   just sweep it under the rug.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.480]   That's a man and a woman
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.360]   who is walking in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.200]   and then eventually,
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.000]   he stands with the sinners.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.760]   He becomes counted with the sinners.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.800]   His life doesn't look any different than a sinner.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.440]   And it is that person, eventually,
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.440]   will find fault in the church.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.720]   Oh, they didn't reach out to me,
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.560]   they didn't do this,
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.400]   and the church was like this,
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.220]   the church was like that,
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.120]   and they leave the church to never come back,
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.120]   and then if you ask them 10, 15, 20 years later,
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.020]   they say the church is not real,
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.700]   it's a bunch of hypocrites,
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:40.320]   and so they become the greatest antagonists to the church,
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.000]   people at one point who said that they were committed,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.480]   all because of self-preservation.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.920]   You know the irony of all of this is?
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.160]   Here's a nation of Israel,
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.280]   and their leaders are calling him demonic,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.720]   and demons themselves recognize Jesus.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.360]   Luke 4.41, demons also were coming out of many shouting,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.080]   "You are the Son of God."
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.440]   But rebuking them, he would not allow them to speak,
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.800]   because they knew him to be the Christ.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.560]   They knew him to be the Christ.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.360]   The demons recognize this.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.820]   Luke 8.28, "Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before him,
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.220]   "and said to the loud voice,
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.580]   "What business do we have with each other, Jesus,
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.880]   "Son of the Most High God?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.960]   "I beg you, do not torment me."
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.000]   Because they knew who he was.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.680]   They were trembling in fear,
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   the demons were trembling in fear,
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.520]   but here's the leaders of Israel.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.560]   Leaders of Israel.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.280]   He is demonic.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:52.600]   Just how far that Israel had fallen from their Lord.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.620]   Just how blind they had become.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.280]   The next group almost seems innocent
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.040]   if you don't pay attention carefully, the skeptics.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.960]   The skeptics didn't outright deny him.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.040]   They wanted proof.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.920]   Now, was it wrong to ask for proof?
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.680]   I mean, we see examples of that
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.340]   in the Old Testament with Gideon.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.240]   Even Thomas, after Jesus resurrected, had a hard time.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.740]   He's like, "Let me, let me see, let me see your scars."
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.920]   And the Bible tells us, "Seek, ask, knock."
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.160]   And he said he will answer.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.360]   So on the surface, it may look like they're asking,
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.840]   so why not give it to them?
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.280]   But the text tells us that they weren't simply asking,
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.800]   they were demanding, they were questioning.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.420]   There's a big difference between somebody
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:45.080]   who is asking questions and somebody who's questioning.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.960]   Questioning is, I've determined in my mind,
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.480]   I'm kind of in agreement with the Pharisees
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.080]   that maybe you're demonic.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.280]   And they're using their skepticism
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.740]   as justification for their unbelief, for their rejection.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:06.660]   Jesus says in Luke 11, 29, "As the crowds were increasing,
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.720]   "he began to say, 'This generation is a wicked generation.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.560]   "'It seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.760]   "'but the sign of Jonah.'"
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.840]   They were seeking signs, not because Jesus didn't give signs
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.460]   and the whole gospel is filled with signs.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.920]   The whole gospel is filled with signs,
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.980]   and yet they say, "We need signs."
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:34.360]   They were using their skepticism as an excuse
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.720]   for not following him.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.800]   Now again, do we have this in the church?
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.640]   Yes.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.760]   We have people who have determined
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   that a casual walk with God is what they're committed to.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.480]   And if they study too hard, if they dig too much,
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.840]   if they ask too many questions,
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.940]   and they come convicted that this must be the truth,
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.020]   they don't want to move from where they are
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.680]   to the next place.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.120]   Because a normal, reasonable response
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.260]   to somebody who is convicted that this is true,
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.840]   that everything that we are doing is temporary,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.680]   it's gonna lead to damnation.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.200]   So a reasonable response was Apostle Paul.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.720]   A reasonable response are the apostles
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.160]   who gave their life,
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.000]   knowing that there's an eternity waiting for them
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.320]   with reward.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   So there was a reasonable,
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.400]   the early church was a reasonable, logical response
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.640]   to the teachings of Scripture.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.960]   If Jesus is who he says, really says he is,
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.720]   and the whole world is under the judgment of God,
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.040]   and death reigns over mankind,
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.600]   all these things, this bucket list that we have
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.280]   that I want to experience, I want to taste it,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.640]   all of it is under the judgment of God.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.520]   So natural, reasonable response is we give our lives,
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.120]   pick up our cross, we spend the rest of our lives
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.100]   trying to tell as many people as possible before we die,
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.360]   so that when we die, we have a clear conscience before God
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.220]   that my life was poured out,
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.520]   and I followed you.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.160]   But we're afraid of that.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.200]   So how much of our ignorance is willful?
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.640]   He said he was going to leave behind evidence
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.680]   of his resurrection.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.160]   Is there proof of the resurrection?
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.680]   If you can be absolutely convinced
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.180]   that the resurrection happened,
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   is a career that important?
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.820]   Is whether you get married or not
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.500]   have eternal consequences?
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.700]   I'm not saying these things are not things
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.860]   that every human being desires,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.820]   but in the light of what it is that we worship,
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.460]   it becomes trivial.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.540]   Everything becomes trivial.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.260]   Everything becomes rubbish, like Paul says,
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.860]   There's a man named Simon Greenlee, professor of law,
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.140]   and he was one of the founders of Harvard Law School.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.780]   He was challenged by one of his students,
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.500]   say, can you disprove the resurrection?
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.260]   He spent many years trying to gather up enough evidence
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.900]   to disprove the resurrection,
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.780]   and then he ended up becoming a Christian.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.940]   Not only a Christian, he becomes an evangelist,
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.300]   and he writes a book called
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.660]   The Testimony of an Evangelist.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.060]   And in that book, this is what he says.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.260]   If any unbiased jury in the world
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.100]   could examine carefully the evidence
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.180]   upon which the claims of Christianity rest,
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.500]   the result would be an undoubting conviction of their truth.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:04:00.040]   How many Christians have made this their life journey?
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.640]   I need to know this is true.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.160]   I need to know if this is actually true,
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   because if it is, I can no longer live this pattern of life.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.260]   I need to give all that I have,
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.520]   not just some, not just the weekends,
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.880]   not when it's convenient, but my life.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:30.040]   So how much of our weak Christian life is willful ignorance?
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.640]   Are we guilty of this?
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.640]   I think many of us have to confess
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.000]   that our lukewarm life is willful,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.700]   that I'm afraid if I'm truly convicted
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.140]   without a shadow of doubt
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.460]   that what he's going to demand of me.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.900]   That word is skeptics.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:09.900]   Jesus' answer, he says, "Satan is not going to attack Satan."
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.700]   That just makes no sense, Luke 11, 17, 19.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.200]   But he knew their thoughts and said to them,
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.780]   "Any kingdom divided against itself,
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.840]   "laid waste, and a house divided against itself, falls.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.960]   "If Satan also is divided against himself,
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.720]   "how will his kingdom stand?
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.540]   "For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.320]   "If I, by Beelzebul, cast out demons,
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   "by whom do your son cast them out?
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.240]   "So they will be your judges."
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.480]   Basically, in other words, it's saying,
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.440]   does it make any sense that Satan would cast out Satan?
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.400]   Most common question that we get in the Western church
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.120]   is that how come we don't see persecution?
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.160]   How come we don't see demonic activity?
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   What is the purpose of demonic activity?
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.800]   What is the purpose of demonic activity?
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.680]   It's to devour us.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.040]   That's what the Bible says.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.000]   But what if the church is already devoured?
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   What if the church is exactly where Satan wants it to be?
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:11.080]   How do you get a professing Christian
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.520]   to be exactly where Satan wants it?
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.800]   He's not gonna curse God.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.760]   He's not gonna shake his fist at God.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.680]   He's not gonna cling to idols and demonic world.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.480]   He's just gonna be lukewarm.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.340]   He's gonna have just enough Jesus to feel like he's okay,
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.320]   and he's gonna stay right there, and no more than that.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.920]   So why does Satan wanna disturb that?
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.440]   Why would he wanna disturb a church
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.720]   that's not evangelizing?
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.200]   Why does he wanna disturb a church
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.960]   that you can't even tell the difference
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.600]   between the world and the church?
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.520]   Why do you wanna disturb a church
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.500]   that's actually helping his cause?
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.100]   How many people have you met saying,
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.240]   "I'm never gonna go to church
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.740]   "because of these hypocrites in the church."
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:08.060]   Now, I'm not saying that all of that is valid.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.700]   You know, we go out to Korea,
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.060]   and I mean, it's a given fact.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.420]   Everybody acknowledges this.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.340]   The reason why that country went from 33%
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.660]   to less than 2% in one generation
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.380]   is because the church
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.220]   is not because of Shincheonji.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.980]   It wasn't because of the cults.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:33.660]   It's not because of North Korea.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.100]   It's the church.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.260]   You talk to people out on the street,
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.300]   that's the first thing they say.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.140]   "I don't wanna hear it.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.100]   "I don't like the hypocrite.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.300]   "I don't wanna be like them."
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.340]   So why would Satan disturb them?
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.580]   Isn't that what Jesus is saying?
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.300]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.420]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.380]   Why would Satan cast out Satan?
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:04.820]   He said, "But what's really happening
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.980]   "is that God is casting out demons.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.180]   "God is casting out demons by the finger of God."
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.220]   Luke 11, 20 to 23.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.060]   "If I cast out demons by the finger of God,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.340]   "then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.660]   You've been spending all these years
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.140]   talking about the kingdom of God,
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.700]   kingdom of God, kingdom of God.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.540]   "But I stand before you and by the finger of God,"
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.380]   finger of God, not the arm of God,
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.820]   not the power of God, finger of God,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.180]   "is nothing for him.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:39.580]   "What you struggle with, this demonic power,
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.980]   "by the finger of God, he's casting out demons.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.580]   "If that's true, the kingdom of God has come upon you,
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.380]   "and you're calling him a demon.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.700]   "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house,
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.420]   "his possessions are undisturbed,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.580]   "but when someone stronger than he attacks him
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.820]   "and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.460]   "on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.860]   "He who is not with me is against me,
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.780]   "and he who does not gather with me scatters."
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.700]   Imagine the restraint of Jesus.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.860]   If he can cast out demons,
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:21.540]   which a natural human being has no power over,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.180]   just by saying, "Get out."
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.780]   And then you see a Pharisee and these people saying,
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.220]   "Prove yourself!"
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.820]   Just the arrogance of that.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.740]   How much restraint it must have taken him
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.140]   not to flick them.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.580]   I mean, can you imagine that?
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.620]   Have you ever done something good for somebody
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.500]   and then they accuse you of evil?
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.500]   I mean, just being accused of evil is bad enough,
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   but when you're sacrificing and giving,
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:00.060]   and then they, the people that you love, is accusing you.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:07.300]   I mean, I could spend all morning this morning
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.460]   telling you about experiences.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.540]   I won't do that for the sake of time.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.500]   But yeah, that's why I say when anybody says
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.100]   they wanna go into ministry, I tell them, "Are you sure?"
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.700]   I say, "Oh, you know, I have a heart for people."
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:24.220]   He's like, "Oh, you know, a heart for people fades quick.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.900]   "As soon as they turn on you,
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.780]   "they don't look that lovable."
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.140]   And even the orphans, he's like, "Oh, orphans,
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:30.980]   "they're so cute."
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.540]   You go there and they cuss you out
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.740]   because you didn't bring enough candy.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.900]   You know what I mean?
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.460]   See how benevolent you feel next time you go.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.580]   They're sinners too.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.620]   That's why I said if you're gonna come into ministry,
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.180]   you must first be so convicted by this truth
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:54.420]   that despite the people that you wanna obey God,
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.880]   that God is worthy.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.100]   And if you're not doing it for God,
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.060]   if you're doing it because you have heart for people,
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.100]   you won't last.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.740]   Can you imagine the restraint
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.940]   that despite what he was about to do,
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.580]   just by the finger of God, he flicks them.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.620]   And he, let me conclude with this.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.780]   He says, "He who is not with me is against me,
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.620]   "and he who does not gather with me scatters."
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.580]   You notice here, there is no third category.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.180]   There is no third category.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.580]   Either you are with him, and because of you,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.060]   the light of Christ is burning brightly,
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.180]   and other people are coming to Christ
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.740]   as a result of you following Christ,
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:46.740]   or because of your lukewarm, nonchalant, worldly attitude,
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:52.860]   people think the church is like you,
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.900]   and as a result of that,
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.020]   they don't wanna go to church either.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.300]   But there is no third category.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.500]   Either we commit to follow Christ,
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.340]   or whether we like it or not,
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.200]   people are leaving because of us.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.100]   We have to be careful that we're not so concerned
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.060]   of offending the world,
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:20.420]   and then not realizing how offensive
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.940]   our behavior is before God.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.260]   He says, "Either you are with me, or you are against me."
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.420]   Let's take this morning's story to heart,
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:38.500]   that the accusers and the skeptics are not that far from us.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.060]   They're not that far from us.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.580]   We're one selfish decision,
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.160]   living each day for my satisfaction,
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.900]   for my glory, for my life,
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:56.980]   and all our prayers is, "Lord, help me
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.040]   "so that I can have a better life."
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.540]   And then that causes us to be blind,
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.460]   and then our blindness causes us to see God,
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.060]   as an antagonist to our life.
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.780]   Let's pray.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:22.540]   Father, open our eyes that we may see
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.940]   the truth of your word.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.160]   Lord, bring revival in our generation.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.380]   Help us, Lord God, search us and know us,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.900]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.740]   Help us to recognize that our life
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.580]   is in Christ, in Christ alone,
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.260]   that we would not covet the praise of men,
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.500]   that we would not covet recognition during this life,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.260]   that we would covet your love,
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.360]   that we would covet your presence in our life
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.700]   more than anything else,
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.540]   that we may be able to honestly confess,
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.660]   as Apostle Paul, that in light of knowing,
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.060]   surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ,
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:00.540]   that all things, all things have become rubbish,
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.460]   that we may be genuine followers of Christ.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.800]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
