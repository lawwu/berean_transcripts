[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.180]   If you did bring a physical check, there is the offering box right at the door.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.200]   Otherwise, you can go ahead and give it digitally.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.980]   Let's pray together.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.720]   Our God, we want to thank you and praise you, Lord.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.980]   Lord, you are so kind and patient to us.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.820]   And what's more, you continue to lead us every single day through your fatherly love.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:20.420]   We pray, Lord, that our response to you would be one of utter trust, great submissiveness, and, Lord, a kind of life that's bearing the fruit of obedience.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:33.260]   And so every time we come together, I pray that this would not just simply be a weekly activity for us, but rather a sweet, sweet time of worship, of learning, of connecting with you spiritually.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:43.420]   So, Father God, we pray for the time of service we have, but also, God, we pray for the offering that we give in worship and in finances.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:50.380]   I ask, Lord, that this, too, would be a reflection, expression, Lord God, of the fruit that we bear.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.280]   Of a fruit of thankfulness, of a fruit of worship.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.500]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:54.800]   Amen.
