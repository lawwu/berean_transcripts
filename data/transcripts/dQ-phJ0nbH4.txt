[00:08:47.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   - Okay, good morning everybody.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   Some announcements for today.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   We'll be having our Family Ministry Picnic today.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   It's going to be between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   You're to bring your own lunch,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   any picnic blankets or chairs, games that you'd like to.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   And it's for members and non-members.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   So we hope that if you're part of Family Ministry
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   you can join us for that.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   We also have our Summertime Seekers Group on Wednesdays
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   for four weeks, 7 p.m. upstairs in our Sprouts Room.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   So if you know anybody who would benefit
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   by coming to a Seekers Group
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   and learning about Christianity,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   interacting with people about where they are in their faith,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   please sign up for that.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   And then if you're a part of the BAM,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   the Koinonia groups are going to be closing today.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   If you are a senior in college,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   you are welcome to sign up for this.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   It's going to be members only
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   and a little bit of a higher commitment
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   because of the nature of accountability
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.520]   for about six weeks, June through August,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   every other week or so.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   And you'll schedule those times within those groups.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   And then lastly, our India Pastor Support,
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   we're going to be opening that up again in June
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   as we do every year.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   The India Pastor Support
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   is going to be $60 per month
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   if you would like to do that.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   As you know, we have missionaries over in India
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   that we support every month.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   And as we do that,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   we're contributing to their monthly needs
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   and whatever else that they,
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520]   as we kind of work with them,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   we're going to be receiving prayer updates
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   and other prayer requests
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.520]   that Pastor Peter's going to be putting up.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   So if you want to be a part of that,
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   we're going to be opening up that in June.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   So take the next couple weeks to think about that.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   Okay, today,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   after our worship set,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   we're going to be having Cat Chung come up
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   and be baptized.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   And if you want to give offering, you can give electronically.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   There's also a physical box in the back.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   I'll pray for us.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   Heavenly Father,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.520]   I pray, Lord, that
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   as we sing about giving an offering
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   to you,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   Lord, that as we give our lives,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   as we give all that we have to you,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   Lord, that it wouldn't be so different
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   how we treat our finances.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   I pray, God, that our offering would truly be
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   from our hearts.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   God, that it would be given joyfully and cheerfully,
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   used for your kingdom. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:36.520]   ♪♪
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.760]   Today we will be introducing an older hymn
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.260]   called "Hallelujah, What a Savior."
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   And to introduce it, I'd like to read a few verses for us.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.960]   Verse 1, it goes, "Man of sorrows, what a name!
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.600]   For the Son of God who came, ruined sinners to reclaim.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.640]   Hallelujah, what a Savior!"
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.040]   Verse 2, "Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.240]   in my place condemned, He stood.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   Sealed my pardon with His blood.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.240]   Hallelujah, what a Savior!"
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.880]   And verse 4, it goes, "Lifted up was He to die.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.020]   It is finished was His cry.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.720]   Now in heaven exalted high.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.820]   Hallelujah, what a Savior!"
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.720]   So this is a simple hymn of exaltation of what Christ has
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.420]   done for us on the cross, and how He resurrected and will
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.460]   return one day in full glory.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.700]   So let us reflect on this gospel as we sing this hymn.

[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   Hi, my name is Katerina Chung, and this is my testimony.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.620]   I grew up in the church, and so I
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.220]   am no stranger to being told Bible stories
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.920]   about the gospel, and how I was a sinner,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.720]   and God was my salvation.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.960]   However, it was in 10th grade when that truly seeped
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   into my brain and heart.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.360]   Up until 8th grade, my spiritual life
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.460]   felt like it was at a standstill,
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.700]   and I didn't really have a sincere relationship with God
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.140]   since I didn't believe the gospel because I couldn't fully
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.840]   grasp it.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   Through Sunday school lessons, I always
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.780]   knew that God sent his son to die on the cross for our sins
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.680]   because of his steadfast love for his children.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.120]   But that never seemed like a logical answer to me
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.580]   because I didn't feel fully loved by God,
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.320]   as every time I experienced something good,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.660]   I would praise and credit myself for it.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.800]   Yet while I experienced something bad,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.360]   I'd immediately blame God and question and doubt
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.300]   his love for me.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.440]   I graduated middle school in the midst of quarantine,
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.540]   and because my church was practicing sheltering in place
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.180]   and many ministries had moved online,
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.180]   I felt a deep and hollow loneliness
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.680]   in my freshman year of high school.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.540]   It felt like no one was willing to go the distance for me
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.180]   and that I didn't deserve anyone's company.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.120]   And throughout all of this, I thought,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.060]   if God really did love me with such vigor,
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.800]   why am I feeling such bad and overwhelming emotions?
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.460]   And so wallowing in self-isolation
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.900]   and feeling discontent at God's presence or lack thereof
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.400]   in my life, I stopped talking with friends from church,
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.740]   and my fellowship presence started on a very rocky path.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.940]   It became something I would dread on Friday nights.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.340]   I started off small at first, leaving
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.180]   in the middle of meetings and convincing myself
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.980]   I was still participating and being a good Christian
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.320]   since I went for half the night.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.080]   These habits grew worse, and I started
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.820]   to skip entire nights of fellowship.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.160]   Spiraling, I made the decision to stop attending fellowship
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.360]   altogether.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.940]   All the while, my parents had no idea what I was up to.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.760]   Just like I had ghosted my friends,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.500]   I tried to do the same with God.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.340]   This ignorant bliss I was experiencing
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.340]   did not last long because my parents were
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.040]   notified of my absence and confronted me about it.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.620]   In choosing the consequence of me ditching fellowship,
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.080]   my parents picked discussion rather than
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.720]   immediate punishment.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.620]   It wasn't at all what I thought I deserved,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.580]   but they gifted it to me anyway.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.320]   And after an honest talk with them, I returned to fellowship.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.520]   Flash forward to the 10th grade, I
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.080]   was back to going to fellowship online every week,
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.760]   and I was even offered a leadership role.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.320]   With support from my friends and family and prayer,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.360]   I accepted the position.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   This opportunity reminded me that I
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   had a wonderful community to serve
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.540]   and how I do have something to lean on for guidance and truth--
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.380]   that is, God's word.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.380]   And I became more engaged with my fellowship
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.240]   and my brothers and sisters.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.800]   I had reconnected with my friends,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.380]   and the understanding and receptiveness they gave me
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.480]   was a blessing from God.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.980]   My life still had its troubles, but I was now aware
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.220]   of God's workings in my life.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.720]   Isaiah 45.7 says, "The one forming light
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.020]   and creating darkness, causing well-being,
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.560]   and creating calamity.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.160]   I am the Lord who does all these things."
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.800]   By that, the love, encouragement, and honesty
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.640]   my peers gave me were through the grace of God.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   I started to realize my past and current interactions
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.200]   as extensions of God's love.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.000]   Reminders of God followed me everywhere
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.540]   I looked-- my friends who gave me time and patience,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.320]   my parents who showed me mercy and compassion,
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.220]   and my advisors who gave me a second chance.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.180]   However, that verse also tells that calamities, too,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.160]   are under his providence.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   The feelings of loneliness and sadness
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.600]   and the sins of me straying from my friends, family,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.860]   and the church were calamities in my life
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.340]   that God used to reveal his masterful love and care for me.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.400]   And so I know now that all of those experiences and acts
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.340]   of love were nothing compared to the love, mercy, grace,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.640]   patience, and compassion that God has for me.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.240]   And the gospel is the epitome of that.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.380]   And so I suppose I was somewhat correct before.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.120]   God's love for us while we were still sinners is illogical.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.860]   But instead of that causing me to dwell in paralyzing doubt,
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.160]   it now only emphasizes my heart of repentance and gratitude
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.920]   for the cross and resurrection.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.860]   In Romans 12, 1, Paul urges for Christians
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.300]   to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.040]   to God as spiritual service of worship because of the mercies
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.840]   God has shown us.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.240]   With new life in the Lord and by the help of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.080]   I aim to please and be a living sacrifice for God, my Savior,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.980]   for he is good and holy.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.340]   His providence through my well-being and calamities
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.920]   are all a part of his mercies and love for me.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   Thank you.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.420]   [applause]
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.360]   [applause]

[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   [inaudible]
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:27.260]  ,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.260]   [applause]
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:47.780]   OK.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.240]   Thank you, Cat, for that testimony.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.680]   And as we think about our own, as we
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.480]   think about how God has purchased us,
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.060]   we can go into today's subject of finances.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.200]   And it's not the easiest topic to go into.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.300]   So I'm going to pray for us to begin,
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.400]   and then we'll launch into this.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.900]   Let's pray.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.940]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for purchasing our lives
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.300]   with the blood of your Son.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:25.140]   Thank you, God, that by doing so you have redeemed us.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.580]   And now we have been wholly, completely been
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.620]   brought into your possession, God, that we belong to you.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.400]   We are so thankful, Lord, to be in such a place,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.800]   so thankful, God, to serve such a good God.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.900]   And I pray, Lord, as we look into today's passage,
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.680]   that it would elicit in us not just something we ought to do,
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.340]   but, Lord, that it would elicit in us desire.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.560]   If you could turn with me to 1 Timothy chapter 6, verse 17.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:14.060]   1 Timothy chapter 6, verse 17, "Instruct those
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.260]   who are rich in this present world not to be conceited
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.840]   or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.280]   but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.440]   Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.580]   to be generous and ready to share,
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.280]   storing up for themselves the treasure
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.320]   of a good foundation for the future,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.080]   so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed."
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.460]   So we know that we live in a consumerist America.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.000]   We know that at the snap of our fingers
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.220]   we're able to get what we want.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.560]   We're very-- it's in recent years, actually, this--
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.060]   I know Amazon feels very--
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.900]   like it's been around for a very long time,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.800]   but it's pretty recent, where you're
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.640]   able to just purchase something from your home.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.840]   Years ago, of course, you would have to go to a mall,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.340]   you would have to go to a store, you
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.320]   would have to actually physically go somewhere.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.180]   But now, from the comforts of our own room,
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.420]   on our own cell phones, we're able to get
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.160]   whatever it is that we want, whenever
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.760]   it is that we want it.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.460]   And generally speaking, we understand this, too.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.000]   I know we're at different places financially,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.960]   but by being here in Southern California,
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.340]   we are amongst the richest people in the world.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.300]   Sometimes we may not feel that way.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.100]   The Bible has much to say about material possession.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.220]   And the passage we're going to look at today is about this.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.080]   The Bible, when it comes to our riches,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.480]   even Jesus, when he was around, walking this earth,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.460]   he spent about 15% of his teachings
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.320]   just on possessions, on wealth.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.600]   He spoke more on possessions and wealth
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.100]   than he did on heaven and hell put together.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.700]   So it's very, very important.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.000]   And Paul is speaking to a young pastor named Timothy, who
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.780]   is pastoring a church in a large church called Ephesus.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.740]   It's the Church of Ephesus, and it
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.120]   consists of many socioeconomic backgrounds, many of whom
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.380]   are wealthy people.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.660]   And so these are the people that are being addressed today.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:22.920]   Today's passage is what we will call doctrinal, teachings.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.860]   Doctrine, sound doctrine, it just simply means sound
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.340]   teaching.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.900]   And that's what Paul is doing with Timothy.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.800]   It's a doctrine on how to view wealth.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.280]   It's God's teaching on wealth.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.920]   It's on what he desires and what he wants of us.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.620]   Over and over again, in the three pastoral epistles,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.180]   there's three of them, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy,
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.760]   and Titus, this is the most repeated word, doctrine,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.260]   teachings.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.260]   Paul emphasizes the sound doctrine
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.840]   because Paul is supposed to be a pastor who is
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.760]   giving this doctrine to others.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.740]   So it's interesting because Paul is instructing Timothy
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.640]   to instruct others.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.740]   Does that kind of make sense?
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.880]   So that's the instruction.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.680]   There's two sets of instructions going on.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.780]   It's like, I'm passing on sound doctrine to you,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.080]   and you pass on sound doctrine to others.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.620]   That's the idea.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.980]   Over and over, it's Paul's main instruction
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.520]   to these young pastors, Titus and Timothy,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.620]   to preach the sound doctrine, and it's something
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.720]   that must be passed on.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.560]   In 2 Timothy 2.2, it says, "The things
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.160]   which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses,
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.260]   entrust these to faithful men who will
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.540]   be able to teach others also."
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.100]   So this is doctrine.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.040]   It's not meant to be something that you just
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:43.940]   teach to yourself.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.680]   It's meant to be also passed on.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.620]   We know that this doctrine isn't strictly
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.280]   held to be, then, content and knowledge and information
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.420]   that you possess, but it's meant to be followed.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.060]   Doctrine has always been and always will be a call to action.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.420]   1 Timothy 4.6, as he speaks of doctrine,
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.860]   he says, "In pointing out these things to the brethren,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.260]   you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus,
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.460]   constantly nourished on the words of the faith
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.760]   and the sound doctrine which," and here it is,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.500]   "you have been following."
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.800]   So when it is that a parent would speak to a child
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.040]   and give instruction, it's not enough for the child to say,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.140]   "I heard it."
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.040]   The expectation is there inside of the instruction, which
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.720]   is to obey or to follow.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.320]   So sound doctrine is not just knowing.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.920]   It's not just knowledge.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.820]   1 Timothy 4.16 describes it even better.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.020]   "Pay close attention to yourself and to this doctrine,"
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.720]   to this teaching.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.300]   "Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching."
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.160]   That is, how are you going to pass this on unless you
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.940]   yourself have possessed it?
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.680]   Unless you yourself are living it out?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.640]   So in doctrine, there is this call to action.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.400]   It's built in.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.220]   Not just simply a set of laws, rules, facts, and principles
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.020]   that you appreciate, not just a momentary conviction,
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.660]   but consistently following such things.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.400]   Doctrine follows along this idea of wisdom.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.000]   Wisdom.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.440]   Wisdom is different than knowledge.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.340]   Knowledge is possessing something
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.140]   that you know as content or material.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.840]   Wisdom is applying that knowledge.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.520]   So that's the big difference.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.940]   If you know how to live as a Christian,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.220]   if you're living here almost like a practical atheist,
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:41.520]   then you would call this gap here foolishness.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.960]   You bring this together as you grow in Christ like this,
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.600]   as you're walking with the Lord,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.500]   that gap gets smaller and smaller
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.960]   because you don't just pronounce what you believe,
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.260]   you live out what you believe.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.440]   And it comes together this way.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.780]   And this is doctrine.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.540]   Biblical wisdom is born only if you have biblical knowledge
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.740]   that you follow through on.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.940]   In 2 Timothy 3.14, it says,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   "You, however, continue in the things you have learned
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.980]   "and have become convinced of."
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   There it is, right?
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.180]   "You know these things,
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.860]   "knowing from whom you have learned them,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.280]   "and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.100]   "which are able to give you the wisdom
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.200]   "that leads to salvation through faith
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.660]   "which is in Christ Jesus."
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.940]   He tells us all scripture,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.400]   all of these things that we know in the Word of God
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.780]   is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.180]   There's not one of us who would disagree with that.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.740]   If we're to look for churches,
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.720]   I'm guessing a vast majority of us
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.380]   would go onto the website,
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.580]   go onto Things This Church Believes,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.560]   and go into this section of scripture.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.700]   And we're looking for key words about the Bible, right?
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.400]   So it's not hard to understand,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.260]   "Okay, yes, I believe all scripture's inspired by God
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.660]   "and profitable for teaching,
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.400]   "so let's keep teaching it."
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.900]   But there's a reason for this teaching.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.640]   It is for reproof, for correction,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.340]   for training in righteousness.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.580]   It's a call to obedience, it's a call to action.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.580]   It's very clear instruction, this doctrine,
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.320]   so that the man of God may be adequate,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.360]   equipped for every good work.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.820]   We can say all the right things in theory,
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.700]   but our lives will display what we believe,
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.760]   which is why he calls for Timothy to watch your life.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.460]   Watch your life and doctrine.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.360]   Today we're going to look specifically
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.200]   at the doctrine of Christian riches.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.300]   The instruction, 1 Timothy 6, 17 through 19,
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.640]   our passage today, the instruction that it gives
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.940]   are to those who are rich in this present world.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.380]   And so he's saying heed.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.780]   He's saying if you are rich in this world, listen,
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.420]   and be ready to apply.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.960]   There are six instructions given in these three verses.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.500]   They're given through infinitives.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.460]   There are six infinitives.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.160]   We're going to combine them together into only four points,
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.440]   but there are six instructions.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.500]   The first instruction is to not be conceited,
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.480]   to not be conceited.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.040]   1 Timothy 6, 17,
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.920]   "Instruct those who are rich in this present world."
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   There it is again, that's who he's speaking to,
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.560]   those who are rich in this world, right now, that's us.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.060]   And he says, "Do not be conceited."
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.720]   That is the instruction.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.400]   Now Paul is talking to people who are already rich.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.840]   In 1 Timothy 6, 9, just a few verses before ours,
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.700]   he says, "But those who want to get rich
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.340]   fall into temptation and a snare,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.840]   and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.880]   into ruin and destruction, for the love of money
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.140]   is a root of all sorts of evil,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.940]   and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.380]   and pierced themselves with many griefs."
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.220]   Again, I understand that we're on a spectrum.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.860]   I understand that some of us are struggling financially
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.620]   and some of us aren't.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.360]   And so 1 Timothy 6, it speaks to a spectrum of people.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.740]   1 Timothy 6, 9, talking to those who want to get rich.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:25.180]   But today's passage is to those who are presently rich.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.880]   That the two people are going to be brought together
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.920]   in the same doctrine in chapter 6, verse 6.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.320]   And it's right here.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.060]   "This is to all believers, but godliness actually
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.660]   is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment."
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.960]   This is the linking thread.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.760]   "For we have brought nothing into the world,
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   so we cannot take anything out of it either.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.740]   If we have food uncovering with these, we shall be content."
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.300]   So in verse 9, when he talks to those who want to get rich,
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.640]   he says, "Be content.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.080]   Do not seek to get rich."
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.880]   It is a snare.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.080]   It is a temptation.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:05.680]   And for our passage today, for those who are already rich,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.920]   Paul is not denouncing the rich man.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.760]   His instruction here, the doctrine,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.360]   is not that he ought to give away all that he has.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:21.460]   Although we should pause and ask ourselves, why not?
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.300]   All it takes is a moment to think.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.800]   Sometimes we jump over that and go,
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.380]   that's not what he really means to sell all that he has.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.240]   So we have to ask, what does he mean?
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.340]   What is the application?
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.120]   Sure, there might be one interpretation, many
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.880]   applications to scripture.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.380]   So what is the application for me?
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.280]   But the prime instruction here is not
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.380]   that you must sell all that you have to the rich man.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.160]   He is not saying, get rid of everything.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.860]   The instruction is, don't be conceited.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.660]   Do not let it get to your head.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.400]   A conceited man is a man who has grown arrogant,
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.900]   as if these riches say something about him.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.240]   As if having money in the bank, the car that he drives,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   or the fact that I have a house, actually
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.380]   says something about me.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.820]   It causes me to be able to lift my head up
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.240]   and walk in such a way.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.120]   But it's an illusion.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.620]   Don't grow conceited.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.660]   You are not in control.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.060]   And you are not what you think you are.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.660]   Sometimes we're deceived into thinking
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.400]   that our riches mean security.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.940]   In a moment, it can be wiped away.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.380]   Just as our very breaths are sustained by God, in a moment,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:41.420]   he snaps, and our homes go up in flames.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.460]   Our jobs are taken away from us.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.020]   Our bank accounts go dry.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.020]   Our stocks are gone.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.760]   In a moment, do not be conceited.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   Do not say, but I've evaluated the risks.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:05.840]   Our investments in this world are easily decimated.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.440]   The rich are more easily deceived into thinking
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.540]   that God is not needed.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.780]   And so he grows in conceit and arrogance.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.920]   It's far easier to fall into a state
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.260]   where you are not dependent on God when you are rich.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.420]   So you'd go to prayer only when you actually
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.820]   are in need of God's help.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.960]   A conceited person doesn't need your help.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.500]   A conceited person can take care of himself.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.560]   A conceited person, everything revolves around him.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.240]   The opposite of a conceited person is a humble man.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.580]   A humble man knows that he is not in control.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.620]   A humble man is dependent on the Lord for everything.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.580]   See, this is not just head knowledge.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.280]   This is felt in the heart.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.620]   Are we dependent on God for everything?
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.120]   Or in our riches, have we grown conceited?
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.400]   Riches will bring a temptation to make you king.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.840]   It will allow you to have what you want when you want it.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.700]   With riches, you buy into the illusion
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.740]   that this world is here to satisfy and to please you.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.180]   You might say, I'm not asking for much.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.920]   I'm not saying I want to be filthy rich.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.220]   You might say all of these types of things,
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.820]   but the desire is there.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.980]   The desire for riches is there.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.560]   The desire for more is there when
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.760]   we think of our cars, our homes, our possessions,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.000]   a certain lifestyle, the way we might live,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.040]   the comforts, the pleasures that this world has to offer,
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.660]   the foods we eat, the vacations we go on,
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.540]   all sorts of materialistic things.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:50.880]   The lie is that you are king, that you are sovereign,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.360]   and our money is going to be how we live it out.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.620]   King of a world that you know is already set ablaze and doomed,
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.460]   longing for, constantly researching,
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.540]   buying into the best things that this world has to offer.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.760]   Our riches give away, in fact, what is inside of our hearts.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.920]   Our riches give away what is inside of our hearts.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:22.120]   It's far better to lose all that we have, all our possessions,
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:27.140]   everything we own, than to fall into this kind of snare,
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.640]   to be disconceited.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.700]   It's better to have nothing in our hands
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.780]   than to have riches that will cause us
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.040]   to grow arrogant in our lives, to say with our lips
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.460]   and then use our finances, declaring that I am.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:49.600]   Whether we have a lot or whether we have a little,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.700]   whatever it is that we think, that this instruction is there
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.800]   to those who are rich in this present world not
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.440]   to be conceited.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.380]   That's the first instruction.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.140]   Secondly, the instruction is to not fix hope
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.780]   on uncertain riches, but on God.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.440]   This is found in verse 17.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.480]   So again, instruct those who are rich in this present world
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.020]   not to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.360]   but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.200]   And now, this idea of fixing hope is very easy.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.260]   It means to hope.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.660]   It means to place expectations upon.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.840]   It would be foolishness to place hope
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   on something so passing or fleeting,
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.280]   something so uncertain.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.480]   And this is an instruction given for Timothy
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.680]   to instruct the rich.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.920]   Stop fixing your hope on riches.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.380]   Again, we have to be careful, because we can very quickly
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.620]   look at our lives and our hearts and think, I'm not.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.620]   I'm not doing that.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.260]   Are we certain?
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:01.000]   He says, do not fix hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.360]   Psalm 62.10, it says, "If riches increase,
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.040]   do not set your heart upon them."
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.280]   Do you know why that's written?
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.580]   Because when your riches increase,
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.880]   the temptation for you to set your hearts upon them
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.380]   increases.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:19.320]   There are a lot of college students, young people
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.220]   at our church, and that's there.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.260]   You think, oh, once I get there, I don't have a big paycheck.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.120]   I still owe my parents money.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.220]   All these kinds of things that are there.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.660]   As riches increase, so your heart
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.900]   will set upon them that those temptations will increase.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.100]   These are not new truths.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.540]   These are not truths that are difficult to understand.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:52.080]   So doctrine means, OK, sure we understand that.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.420]   We understand that when riches increase,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.720]   we are not to set our heart upon them.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.520]   Doctrine means, have you considered
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   your recent decisions?
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.120]   That's kind of what doctrine is.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.400]   It's not just telling you facts that we already know.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.600]   Otherwise, I'm just going to keep saying the same things
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.460]   we all know, right?
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.160]   What's the point?
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:16.740]   It brings us to the footstool, right?
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.000]   It brings us to the throne.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.840]   And it causes us to look and to evaluate.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.780]   Not other people, not in comparison to other people.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.640]   That person has a bigger house.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.580]   Talk to them first.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.280]   And then to me, I'm just renting.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:38.920]   This is here for all of us, this temptation that's there.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.860]   When you see your wealth grow, the temptation
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.800]   to set your heart upon it will grow.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.300]   And we think we don't have much, so it's not going to be there.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.340]   It is there.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.440]   Proverbs 23.4, "Do not weary yourself to gain wealth.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.900]   Cease from your consideration of it."
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.040]   Do we know what cease means?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   It means stop.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.840]   Sometimes I think we think it means slow down.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.420]   It means to just take some time to evaluate it.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.320]   No, it actually just means stop.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.660]   It means cease from your consideration of it.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.860]   When you set your eyes on it, it is gone.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.500]   That word "when" is powerful.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.400]   It's very, very weighty and strong.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.160]   When, when you set your eyes on it, poof, it is gone.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.560]   For wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.600]   flies toward the heavens.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.960]   And so we come across passages like Luke 12.19.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.040]   And we look at it, very challenging.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.740]   "And I will say to my soul, soul,
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.000]   you have many goods laid up for many years to come.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.200]   Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.680]   But God said to him, you fool, this very night
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.280]   your soul is required of you.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.740]   And now who will own what you have prepared?
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.980]   So is the man who stores up treasure for himself
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   and is not ready to give it to you.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.280]   So is the man who stores up treasure for himself
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.720]   and is not rich toward God."
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.560]   Our thought process and use of money
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   is central to our lives because it actually
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.360]   shows you what you believe.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.860]   It shows what we value.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.660]   Talking about doctrine, how we spend our money
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.940]   is that intersection of things that we might be taught,
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.300]   but the obedience and call to action in it.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.540]   Our decisions follow our beliefs.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.680]   And so, yes, evaluating how we spend our money
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.240]   can be very, very uncomfortable.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.220]   Putting this sermon together, it was very uncomfortable for me.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:33.820]   But it's also such an excellent tool for us.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.220]   That's what's amazing about this.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:40.260]   It's awesome because we have an excellent tool
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.620]   at our disposal.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.960]   Where has my money been going?
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.940]   And what does that reveal about my heart?
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   It's cool, right?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.640]   That's a very powerful thing that we have.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.180]   Each of us, we get bank statements every single month.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.420]   What this means is, all I have to do
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.880]   is look and ask myself, what does this say about my heart?
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.460]   Matthew 6.33 says, "But seek first
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.860]   his kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.820]   and all these things will be added to you."
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.160]   Later on, he says, "For where your treasure is,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.240]   there your heart will be also."
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.980]   So where we have placed our treasures,
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.380]   what does that show about where my heart is?
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.580]   In fact, your use of money will show you
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.180]   who is your functioning master, who is your God, who
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.720]   is your king, and your Lord.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.320]   It says in Matthew 6.24, "No one can serve two masters,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.160]   for either he will hate the one and love the other,
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.320]   or he will be devoted to one and despise the other."
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.960]   You cannot serve God and wealth.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.600]   Don't turn off the ears here.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.940]   You cannot.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.680]   You cannot serve God and wealth.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.980]   Does our use of money show where we are fixing our hope?
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.620]   Is it upon the things of this world that do not last,
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.280]   or is it upon God?
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.280]   Is it upon the things of our kingdom and what I want,
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.820]   or upon God's kingdom and what God wants?
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.100]   What this passage says is that there is no neutral place
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.340]   There is struggle, yes, but there is no in-between place
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.940]   where you're like, "It's neither for God's kingdom or for mine.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:24.980]   It's one or the other, and then everything else is a fight."
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:32.120]   So where is my heart?
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.880]   And aside from the words I'm able to speak,
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.420]   what does my spending have to do with my heart?
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.120]   And aside from the words I'm able to speak,
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:47.020]   what does my spending of money say about my heart?
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:56.500]   Very uncomfortable, but really good.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.140]   Money will come and money will go, but our hope is anchored.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.000]   It is to be fixed upon God.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.940]   Set your hope on God.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.080]   Put your money there, because God does not come and go.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.840]   God is forever.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.880]   That's why this is not just about money management.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.120]   We're not just trying to get better in how we spend our money.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.360]   We're not just trying to get better at sinning less
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.560]   by being less greedy, by stealing less from God.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.700]   We understand that all of it belongs to God,
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.340]   that I am a sold-out slave of God,
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.200]   that I have been redeemed by God.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.980]   And so all that I own, not just my money, my time, my life,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.840]   my energy, all that I am is for God.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.980]   And now we are struggling, we are striving,
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.020]   we are pursuing, and we are fighting for this.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.020]   But the purpose is not just to manage that.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.560]   It is to surrender.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.500]   Not just getting better at stealing less,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.240]   but not to steal from God at all.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.740]   We agree on the doctrine here.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.040]   The doctrine calls us today to live it out.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.080]   What do our lives show?
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.840]   There's a man by the name of Jim Elliott, famous quote,
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.720]   "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.080]   to gain what he cannot lose."
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.680]   Wonderful, right?
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.520]   Print it out and frame it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.220]   Put it in your kitchen.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.600]   "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.860]   to gain what he cannot lose."
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.160]   Sound doctrine there, if I ever saw one.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.640]   But he lived it out.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:48.880]   At the age of 26, he gave his life for this doctrine.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.380]   What of us, what is our doctrine?
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.520]   How large is our gap between what we practice
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.980]   and what we preach?
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:05.960]   For to me, to live is Christ and die is gain.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:12.560]   But what do our decisions say about this?
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.860]   Spurgeon, he says, "I do not want you to have to say
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.560]   when you come to die.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.300]   I have had large possessions, but I have been a bad steward.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.740]   I have had a competence and I have wasted my master's goods.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.780]   All I have done with my wealth was to furnish my house well,
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.820]   perhaps to buy expensive pictures and to allow myself
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:34.420]   luxuries which did me more harm than good.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.860]   Brethren, some men spend so much upon themselves and so little
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.920]   for the Lord that they seem to me to eat the apple
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.060]   and give Christ the pairings."
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.560]   And so this was the second point.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.740]   The instruction is not to fix hope on uncertain riches,
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.200]   but place them on God.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.000]   And he begins to describe what this looks like
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.240]   in the following instructions.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.840]   Point number three, the instruction to do good
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.940]   and to be rich in good works, these are instructions
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.580]   numbers three and four.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.380]   The instruction is to do good and to be rich in good works.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:08.580]   Verse 17 tells us, "Those who are rich in the present world,
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.420]   instruct them," and then verse 18 says, very simply,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.720]   two more infinitives, "to do good,
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.160]   to be rich in good works."
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   But they're instructions.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.260]   These are doctrines.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.100]   This portion of the instruction is what you would call
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.700]   the exercise portion.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.400]   This is how you do it.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.900]   It's not fix your hope on the things of the world,
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.100]   but on God.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.180]   Do good and be rich in good works.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.680]   That's how you practice.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   Doing good is the same instruction for the rich
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.380]   and the poor.
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.120]   When it comes to Christianity, it's not whether you have a lot
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.020]   or a little.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.420]   We are given the same thing.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.620]   This is the responsibility given to us as believers
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.500]   who have a Heavenly Father who cares for us.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.020]   In Ephesians 2.10, it says, "For we are his workmanship,
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.060]   we are created in Christ Jesus," and that word "for,"
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.460]   "for good works."
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.560]   That's purpose statement.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.060]   We are created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.100]   We workmanship of God.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.240]   He has fashioned us for good works.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.540]   There is a purpose.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.500]   There's a reason why people build things, right?
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.680]   For a purpose, whether it's functional or whether it's
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.440]   form, it's there to accomplish something.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.420]   Because our purpose is for good works, which God prepared
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.820]   beforehand so that we would walk in them,
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:33.520]   so that we would live it out.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.720]   What this means is that if God has given you riches,
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.100]   what is the point of it?
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.160]   It means, the point of it is, that it is that we are to do
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.060]   good works.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.640]   Because we were created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.380]   Because this is who God is.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.680]   He is a God of good works.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.740]   All the works he does, it shouldn't even have to be
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.020]   saying good works.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.980]   He just does works and all of it is just good.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.020]   It's just good works.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.380]   This is who he is.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.980]   And now we are the hands and feet of God.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:07.220]   Hands and feet of Christ here in this world, the body of Christ.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.500]   And we were created to do the things that he wishes and wills
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.260]   to accomplish in this world.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:18.340]   What Jesus came to do that we are here to do.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.100]   All of the resources given to us to be expended for that
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:28.680]   purpose, because that is my purpose in life.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.220]   We're image bearers of God.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.080]   We do the things that God would want.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.580]   If I were to give something to my child,
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.460]   there's an expectation that comes with that giving.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.760]   With my children, if I'm to give them something,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:46.900]   they know automatically because this is who we are in the home,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.700]   that they are called to share.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.840]   Very simple parental thing that all of us as parents,
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.280]   if we're parents, have experienced.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.980]   That we are called to teach them this, to share,
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.480]   to be gracious, to be generous, and to be kind.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.640]   It's one of the ugliest things to see when out of your love
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.480]   and desire for your child to have such good things and you
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.360]   give it to them, only to overhear in the other room them
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.460]   flaunting it and hoarding it and not sharing it.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.920]   What you would want to do is just to take that away or not
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.620]   to give at all.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:23.200]   It's one of the ugliest things.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.360]   And so now what of us?
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:31.000]   God has given to us all that we have for a purpose.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.780]   Why has he given you your home?
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.740]   Why has he given you a car?
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.840]   Why has he given you your job?
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:45.320]   Why has he given you your finances?
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:51.820]   Why has he given you your families for good works?
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.560]   Think of how he sees us.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.260]   Does he see a child who is being selfish, hoarding,
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.940]   simply for my own good pleasure, and not in any way
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.180]   considering what he wants, not in any way considering
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.480]   the needs of the others?
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.040]   It's me.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.720]   Everything just gated inside to me.
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:19.820]   My backyard, even in the things that we would say is good
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:25.060]   works, it's just about me, about accomplishing my duties.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.660]   How would the father feel?
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.440]   Now, he says, do good works.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.900]   That's an active thing.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.600]   But he also says, be rich in good works.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.480]   This is passive.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.080]   He says, this is what you were called to do, and then now,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.980]   grow in this.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.540]   Be rich in good works.
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.780]   Grow in this.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.340]   He continues this thought of doing good.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.380]   Doing good is something that is commanded actively.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.480]   But if we are to look under the hood of a Christian,
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:59.160]   it should be rich in good works.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.160]   Rich, not just trying to do good works here and there.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.640]   It should be growing in richness in good works.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.940]   If we're Christians who have been living for year
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.060]   after year after year--
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.040]   I've been a Christian for 20 years.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.800]   I am called to be growing in this,
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:16.140]   growing in abundance, in richness
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:25.820]   when it comes to good works, to use money to help others,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:30.560]   to use what I have to help in any capacity that I see.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.120]   Ultimately, ultimately, to do what God wants,
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.520]   what God would deem as good.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:43.060]   And so it doesn't stop with just feeding a perishing life.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:47.340]   The end goal is eternal life.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.900]   And so we use what we have to accomplish his purposes,
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.940]   to do what is best for our fellow people.
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.140]   For the Christian is to be good in good works,
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.280]   to advance the kingdom.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.640]   Money in the hands of a carnal person
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.580]   is altogether self-centered.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.960]   Good works is a duty to be accomplished.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.760]   But money in the hands of a Christian saved by grace
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.160]   is altogether functional for the kingdom to spread God's love.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.840]   Our aim is to use wealth to do this ultimate good,
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.400]   rather than something that is simply
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.080]   there for personal comfort, pleasures, and luxuries.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.940]   John 10:10 shows why Jesus came into this world.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.280]   "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.980]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.960]   Taken incorrectly, this can seem like it's all about me
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.880]   because Jesus came, and wow, he came to give me life
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.360]   and to give me life abundant.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:45.360]   And we can stop there and think that that's what--
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.800]   what does it mean to have an abundant life?
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.960]   It means true life.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.540]   It means eternal life.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.380]   Not to live this life for pleasures
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.480]   that are passing and fleeting and leading to death.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.880]   That's not life.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.680]   An abundant life is this life that proliferates,
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.980]   and it expands, and it grows, and it's lavish.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.380]   Jesus came so that I might have that kind of life.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.480]   He came into this world so that the world
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.520]   can have this kind of life.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.820]   Not one that is just fenced in and just
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.860]   trying to live out the things that we want here,
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.240]   just biding our time till we get into that kingdom.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:30.340]   This idea of abundant life means something that keeps growing.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.400]   It cannot be contained.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.300]   That if God has given me this kind of life,
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.200]   that the only option, the only thing that
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.900]   comes out outside of something like that,
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.840]   of a realization of that, is that there
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.420]   needs to be more of that.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.840]   That's what all that I do are being used.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.820]   All the things that I have are being
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.720]   used to proliferate that abundant life.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:58.320]   So that was instructions three and four.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.820]   The last two instructions, five and six,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.500]   are the instructions to be generous and to be sharing.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:14.400]   1 Timothy 6, 18, "to be generous and ready to share."
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.200]   Again, these doctrines are very simple.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.840]   He expands upon it by saying, "storing up
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.740]   for themselves the treasures of a good foundation
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.080]   for the future, so that they may take hold
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.640]   of that which is life and deed."
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.820]   He says, be generous.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.520]   There is your instruction.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.580]   Be generous.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.420]   Are you generous?
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.760]   Be generous, give without restraint, to be liberal,
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.100]   to be bountiful in giving.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.000]   Remember how we just read that Jesus
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.140]   came to give life abundant.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.640]   We don't get to redefine what it means to give.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.800]   Jesus came and said, this is what it means.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.000]   This is what it looks like.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.880]   We don't get to redefine what it means to love.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.880]   Jesus came and he says, this is what it is to love.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.220]   He says, the things that I give were to be abundant,
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.480]   to be liberal, to be bountiful.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.080]   There's a Korean saying, and I forgot it,
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.620]   so I'm not going to even try, but I'll give you the meaning.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.060]   There's a Korean saying.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.700]   I'll probably butcher even the meaning,
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.200]   but I'll try to give you the shell of it.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.900]   But it talks about when you're a parent,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.160]   you never count how much money is going out.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.580]   You see your kids, and you don't take notes saying,
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.380]   oh, this t-shirt costs this.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.400]   And then today, I took them to Pho,
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.640]   and this is how much it cost.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.520]   And then I took them to Chuck E. Cheese for a birthday party,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.720]   and each of their friends costed this many.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.180]   So parents don't do that, right?
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:44.460]   Parents, we budget, and we look at our finances,
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.860]   but at the end, whatever it takes
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.660]   to take care of our children.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.660]   But the Korean saying goes, that's how it goes,
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.060]   but when you go the opposite way,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.200]   children, when they come to age where they have to begin
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.140]   to provide for their parents, count every cent.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.780]   It's really interesting that the idea of this
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.340]   is that even if you don't say it out loud,
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.580]   there's something where you're counting the dollars.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:13.620]   And there's a reason why instruction is given to parents
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.820]   to honor their parents, even monetarily.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:24.260]   Instruction needs to be given because of what's there.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:29.300]   But these parents, they give it gladly, lavishly.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.400]   We are to give generously, liberally, bountifully.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.740]   When he says, be generous, meeting
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:44.380]   the needs that are there, are we generous?
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.420]   We have some generous people at our church.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.380]   Let me tell you, that service auction every year
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.480]   blows me away.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.920]   What is the matter with our church?
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.280]   That's what I think at every service auction.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.960]   But I'm so thankful that it goes to missions.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.920]   We have our budgets.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.800]   I mean, look, I have a budget.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.360]   I have a budget part that says this
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.340]   is what we're going to give.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.600]   I'm not going to tell you how much, but it's there.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   You might have that.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.540]   It's like, there it is.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.380]   There's our budget.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.200]   There's our balance.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.420]   But he says, give liberally, bountifully,
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.060]   the way God came into this world, to give abundant life.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.420]   What it took, 1 John 3:16 says, "If we know love by this,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.060]   that he laid down his life for us,
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.200]   and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.620]   But whoever has the world's goods
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.340]   and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him,
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.140]   how does the love of God abide in him?
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.540]   Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue,
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.940]   but in deed and truth."
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.080]   That's doctrine.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.380]   Not just that you have the truth, but in deed.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.580]   Don't just say the words, but to live it out.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.380]   God generously gives to us.
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.180]   Ephesians 1:7, "In him, we have redemption through his blood.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.520]   The forgiveness of our trespasses
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.220]   according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished on us.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.560]   I pray that the eyes of your heart
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.760]   may be enlightened so that you will know
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.100]   what is the hope of his calling.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.460]   What are the riches of the glory of his inheritance
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.700]   in the saints?"
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.000]   He has lavished us.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.440]   And so he says, give lavishly.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.740]   The last instruction, to be sharing.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.380]   It feels like this is just like a child's sermon, you know?
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.280]   Be generous.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.940]   Be sharing.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.880]   Share what you have.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.580]   Give from what God has already given you.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.780]   It's an idea of stewardship.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.460]   That all that you have, you do not have anything
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.600]   that you yourself deserve.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.120]   Not one thing.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.320]   You think I've bootstrapped?
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.900]   You think I've climbed the ladder?
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.700]   You think I've put in all this hard work,
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.200]   and so I deserve it?
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.340]   Where do you get that from?
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:51.740]   Now, of course I'm not discounting the hard work.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.980]   Of course I'm not discounting the fact
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.780]   that you reap what you sow.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:01.620]   The idea is that everything that I have--
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.820]   my breath, my hands, my feet, my body, my life--
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.020]   is a gift from God for a purpose.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.460]   Share.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.220]   There's a purpose for it.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.120]   2 Corinthians 9.10, "Now he who supplies seed to the sower
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.060]   and bread for the food will supply and multiply
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.460]   your seed for sowing."
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.460]   You have to be careful how you read this.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:27.240]   Basically, he who supplies what you have
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.980]   has given it to you for a purpose.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.740]   What does it say?
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.540]   For sowing.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:39.620]   Not to hoard.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.160]   Not to increase my harvest, but to increase
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.660]   the harvest of righteousness.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.700]   You will be enriched in everything.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.320]   Great, but for what?
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.660]   For all liberality, which through us
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.000]   is producing thanksgiving to God.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.040]   So we're called, then, to give generously and to be sharing.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.280]   And he expands upon that.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.180]   He says, "Store up treasures in heaven."
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.780]   Now, this is where I kind of titled the sermon what it was,
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.160]   because we're not health wealth, and we're not name and claim.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.720]   We are not people who say, like, God
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.020]   wants you to be rich and everything here in this world
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.160]   and have everything that you would ever want.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.900]   If you have faith, that's not it.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.500]   But he does call us to be rich.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.400]   Rich in good works, and he calls us here
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.280]   to store up treasures in heaven.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.140]   What we invest here in this world will have eternal reward.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.140]   It's the soundest advice that you will ever receive.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.880]   This is financial advice.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.280]   It just makes no sense for us to say that this world is just
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.060]   gone like that, and that we are going to live forever there.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:58.960]   You know what this passage is saying is invest in the there,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.860]   not in the here.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:04.440]   And we're like, yeah, that is so obvious.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.740]   Why is it that when I pull up my bank account,
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.340]   it says something different?
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.240]   Why?
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.080]   Store up there.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.280]   He's saying be rich there.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.720]   He's commanding us to store up great wealth in the kingdom.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.420]   Being rich in and of itself is not negative.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.520]   It is not sinful.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.460]   He wants us to be rich.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.060]   He is a rich God who lavishes us.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:35.100]   But this world is passing away.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.960]   This is sound financial advice.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.740]   Your financial advisor will say if you delay gratification.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.980]   If you put aside $100 here, it will
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.040]   grow to here so that you can use it when you are 65.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.180]   Something like that.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.520]   And then you die.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.820]   If you spend $100 for the kingdom,
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.560]   the idea is it is eternal.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.280]   That's cool.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.720]   When God promises good things, we know it's going to be good.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.000]   So we don't know exactly what that's going to look like.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.200]   But we know it's going to be good.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.340]   Service auction.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.400]   Every year, I look for one thing because it's
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.600]   so entertaining to me.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.000]   It's the one where one of our church members
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.140]   puts up a mystery box.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.340]   And in this mystery box, the first time I saw it,
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.440]   I was like, what is going on?
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.620]   It was in such high demand.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.780]   And it was a mystery box.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:29.380]   You don't even know what you're going to get.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.380]   Why?
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.720]   Why were they doing that?
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.320]   Because they knew the person who was putting it up.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.080]   It was incredible.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.220]   They knew that this person only gives good things.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.060]   The best things.
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.560]   Sought-on couponers.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.060]   And whenever he would put things up,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.000]   it was everyone just trying to get what you could get.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.540]   Oh, if only we could look like that when it came
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.940]   to the treasures of heaven.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.440]   To invest like that.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.480]   To know that what God gives is so much better.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.540]   Randy Alcorn, he says, God wants your heart.
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.720]   He isn't just looking for donors for his kingdom.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.180]   Those who stand outside the cause
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.480]   and dispassionately consider acts of philanthropy.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.920]   He's looking for disciples immersed
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.120]   in the causes they give to.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.300]   He wants people so filled with a vision for eternity
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.060]   that they wouldn't dream of not investing their money, time,
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.860]   and prayers where they will matter the most.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:29.880]   And so today, these instructions are not prohibitions, mainly.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.540]   It's saying, yeah, stop putting your money here
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.640]   because that makes no sense, but invest in kingdom things
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.240]   that last.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.760]   He concludes in verse 19 by saying,
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.360]   take hold of what is life.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.720]   He says that by doing this, you'll
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.120]   be taking hold of what is life indeed.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.300]   In 1 Timothy 6.11, it says, but flee from these things,
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.940]   you men of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness,
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.200]   faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.600]   Fight the good fight of faith.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.640]   Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called,
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.700]   and you made the good confession in the presence
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.800]   of many witnesses.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.440]   If you look very carefully here in the passage that
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   leads up to our passage today is that there
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.540]   is much instruction.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.520]   He says flee.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.020]   He says fight.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.780]   He says pursue.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.080]   Take hold.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.160]   You know what that means?
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.620]   That means it is what we teach our children.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.520]   You have to work hard in order to be able to get.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.720]   It's not just going to come into your lap.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.620]   What this is saying is you are not going
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.860]   to just become godly in this.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.340]   These temptations are not just going
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.200]   to go away because you know that it's going to be there.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.600]   You're not going to be like, oh, I have some convictions,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.400]   so we walk out that door and something has changed in me.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.540]   No, he gives us instruction.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.340]   He gives us doctrine.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.480]   Follow it.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.480]   What he's saying here is fight for every step,
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.780]   for you are in a war.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.560]   Flee from the temptations that are there.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.720]   Take hold of that which is life, because you will not naturally
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   do this in your flesh.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.460]   Pursue godliness.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.160]   Pursue righteousness.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.640]   Get away from the things that take your eyes off
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.140]   on the things of this world, and take your eyes off of God.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.640]   Put your things into the things that will cause
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.240]   you to look up at the kingdom.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.740]   He is saying, do this.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.540]   Take hold of what is life.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.140]   Don't sit there wondering, why am I so apathetic?
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.620]   Why am I so jaded?
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.540]   Why am I so easily tempted?
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.220]   Why am I so easily shaken?
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:40.180]   Obey, for where your treasure is there,
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.560]   your heart will be also.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.320]   Sow, and you will reap it.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.940]   Live in accordance to the things that you believe,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.540]   and watch it grow.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.580]   Look with your own two eyes, and see that that is worth it.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   And so the desire grows, and you will grow.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.060]   And we will check under the hoods of our hearts
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.220]   in each other, and we will see rich and good works.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:15.820]   Paul makes a description earlier on here
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.660]   of what it looks like to take this life.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:25.100]   He won't just fall into our laps.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.000]   It's a call to pursue.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.800]   1 Timothy 6, verse 10, it says, "For the love of money
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.540]   is root of all sorts of evil, and some, by longing for it,
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.080]   have wandered away from the faith."
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:37.820]   You see the wander?
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.240]   It's a wander.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.280]   It wasn't intentional.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.860]   None of us intentionally do this.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.520]   If we don't take hold of that which is life indeed,
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.120]   we will wander.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.560]   Mark 10, 21, looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.420]   This is the rich, young ruler, the one who said,
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.400]   I have done all these things you have commanded.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.760]   I have been a good--
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.160]   we'll put it to today's terms.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.840]   I've been a good Krishna, I've gone to church,
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.740]   I've done good things, I've given to the poor.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.940]   I've done all of this to the best of my ability.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:11.480]   And Jesus, it says, felt a love for him and said to him,
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.440]   one thing you lack, go and sell all you possess
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.780]   and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.480]   and come and follow me.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.280]   Meaning that we can do all that we say with our lips.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.320]   We can open our mouth up and down
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.860]   and say all the right doctrines and say, yes, I'm trying.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.320]   I go to church, and I serve, and I
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.460]   use my money for good things.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.320]   I try to be generous, as generous as I can.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.400]   And all of this, we can put all these things up.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.560]   But he says he wants it all.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.540]   The point of living like this is that by living generously
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.240]   and sharing and storing up in treasures in heaven,
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.840]   it's not just sacrifice that he's talking about,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.940]   that we're getting better at this.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.320]   We're talking about surrender of life to something
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.580]   that we believe, that is, that this world is uh-uh.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.380]   We don't want it.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.720]   But we want Christ.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.760]   And it makes sense.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.260]   We will not walk away from this.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:11.540]   Taking hold of true life is anything
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.940]   that draws us towards the kingdom.
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.840]   It's what brings us into whatever
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.240]   propels our heart towards the kingdom and the king.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.840]   If money is causing us to take our eyes off of Christ,
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.240]   or what it can purchase is taking off our eyes off
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.520]   of Christ, then we're in trouble.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.220]   We're not living in the life he has given.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.220]   That is not true life.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.920]   That is not abundant life.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.060]   But when we live with loose hands,
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.000]   knowing he will care for us and give abundantly and lavishly
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.860]   for the kingdom, sowing there we know
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.800]   will always produce eternal reward,
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.840]   and we will truly live life.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.600]   The world might see us as failing, losing, dying,
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.500]   wasting.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.640]   For us, it's not.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.420]   We are no fools who give up what we cannot take.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:03.580]   A.W. Tozer, to conclude, says, "As basic a thing as money often
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.420]   is, it yet can be transmuted into everlasting treasure.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.700]   It can be converted into food for the hungry and clothing
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.920]   for the poor.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.200]   It can keep a missionary actively winning lost men
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:15.000]   to the light of the gospel, and thus transmute itself
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.340]   into heavenly values.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.440]   Any temporal possession can be turned into everlasting wealth.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.500]   Whatever is given to Christ is immediately
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.500]   touched with immortality."
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.980]   And so this was the doctrine from 1 Timothy chapter 6,
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.380]   verse 17 to 19.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.840]   This was the doctrine.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.180]   This is what he instructed Timothy
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:38.860]   to preach to the church, to those who are presently
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.400]   rich in this world.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:46.160]   Here are your six instructions to go and live it out.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.600]   To sit down, to actively make decisions now.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.380]   To not think that our decisions are just going to change,
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.080]   that we're going to wander into that.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.440]   Because if we are not being intentional and active,
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.020]   we will wander in the opposite direction.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.180]   That's what the Bible says.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.420]   So let's not be fools.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:08.380]   Let's grow in wisdom.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.860]   In whatever capacity that God has given.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.060]   Whether we're rich or whether we're poor.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.200]   Whether we have a lot or whether we have a little.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.640]   Whether we're struggling or we're fine.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.240]   As Christians, we live together for the same purpose.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:22.740]   Let's pray.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:30.780]   Heavenly Father, would you help us in this?
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.420]   We are weak.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.880]   But God, we know that you can work in us.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.620]   As you open our eyes and our ears to hear.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.720]   That we would hear, listen, obey, and understand.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.620]   That we would heed your word.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.100]   And Father, that we would look to our hearts, to our lives.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.740]   That your spirit would cause that kind of reflection
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.800]   inside of us.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.740]   And that by your work, Lord, that we would respond.
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.740]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.240]   Amen.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.640]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:19.680]   [MUSIC - "I'D RATHER HAVE JESUS"]
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.700]   (SINGING) I'd rather have Jesus.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:37.740]   I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:45.720]   I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:53.720]   I'd rather be led by his nail-pierced hand
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:02.240]   than to be the king of a vast domain
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   and be held in sin's dread sway.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:18.720]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.220]   this world affords today.
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:35.200]   I'd rather have Jesus than man's applause.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:43.180]   I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:51.180]   I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:59.160]   I'd rather be true to his holy name
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:07.640]   than to be the king of a vast domain
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:13.140]   and be held in sin's dread sway.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:24.120]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   this world affords today.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.600]   He's fairer than lilies.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:40.100]   He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:48.080]   He's sweeter than honey from out of the comb.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:56.560]   He's all that my hungry spirit needs.
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:04.560]   I'd rather have Jesus than let him be
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:12.540]   than to be the king of a vast domain
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.540]   and be held in sin's dread sway.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:29.440]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:37.420]   this world affords today than to be--
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:45.920]   than to be the king of a vast domain
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:50.920]   and be held in sin's dread sway.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:23:01.920]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.900]   this world affords today.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:14.900]   Well, Father, we do trust that you'll
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.240]   provide for our every need.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:21.220]   We trust in you, God, that you are enough for everything.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.320]   So we thank you, Lord, for your son Jesus and the work
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.520]   that he has done in us.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.720]   And I pray, God, for fruit that goes out and causes us to be
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.720]   the hands and feet of Christ.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.520]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.860]   and the love of God our Father and the fellowship
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.200]   of the Holy Spirit be with us both now and forevermore.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:38.700]   Amen.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:51.420]   (SINGING) God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.420]   He came to the earth.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:04.400]   He went through heaven and earth.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:11.400]   He died to buy my pocket.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:22.880]   An empty grave is there to my Savior's place.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:36.280]   Because he lives, I can't face tomorrow.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:47.260]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:58.260]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:06.740]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:28.140]   In time of need, Lord, I can't help but see faithful you are,
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:37.620]   faithful forever you will be, faithful you are.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:46.000]   And all your promises are yes and amen.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   All your promises are yes and amen.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:11.400]   Beautiful Savior, you have brought me near.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.900]   You pulled me from the ashes.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.400]   You have broken every curse.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:27.000]   Blessed Redeemer, you have set this captor free.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.580]   (upbeat music)
