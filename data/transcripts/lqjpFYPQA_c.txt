[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:32.500]   Thank you.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:16:02.480]   Thank you.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.860]   for sinners to be reconciled to God from the beginning. So God didn't say, hey, in order for
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.560]   you to come to me, these are the things that you need to go through. And that's why we think that
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:18.040]   when Cain and Abel was giving sacrifice, again, it doesn't say it there, but it seems like they
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.100]   already understood what was acceptable was not acceptable. And so what Cain was doing wasn't
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:30.060]   simply by convenience. It was disobedience, right? And that's why later on Cain is called evil for
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:36.880]   what he did, okay? So we see that from the get-go, God, even though judgment came into mankind,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.800]   immediately God provided a way to reconcile them to God. Does that make sense? It wasn't like a long
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.680]   period of time went by where they had no way to get to God. It was from the very beginning, he provided
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:57.460]   a way where sacrifices were made so that the atonement could have happened, again, foreshadowing what was
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:04.380]   about to come, okay? And then in seven, two to three, God required, if you remember, he said to the clean
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:11.360]   animals were to be given in seven. So in Hebrew, it literally says seven, seven, which means a pair of
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:18.180]   seven, right? So all the clean animals were seven pairs, and all the unclean animals were one pair.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:25.300]   Now, why was that? Okay? Now, clearly it tells us, some people will say it's for food. Obviously, it was for
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:31.080]   food. Later on, God tells us, tells them that they can eat these animals. But prior to that, in 820,
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.720]   it spells out that as soon as Noah comes out of the ark, the first thing that they do is they give burnt
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:45.420]   offering, right? Again, burnt offering is mentioned in Leviticus chapter one. And yet, it says here that he gave
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:52.680]   burnt offering. So Noah somehow knew that already. And so in order to give burnt offering, only clean
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:59.040]   animals were able to be given as burnt offering, right? So God was providing for them, even as they're
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:05.660]   entering into the ark, a way for them to worship him, right? And to be atoned, their sins to be atoned for
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:12.420]   through these animals, even as he is preserving these animals. Does that make sense? Okay? So this is not something
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:18.060]   that happened gradually from right off the bat, God provided a way for them to get to him, right? Even the
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:25.260]   animals that he preserved, you can see that in the details, okay? So how many years went by from the time
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:31.680]   when God told Noah? Now, some will say 120, simply because in the previous chapters, it says that the
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:39.340]   number of years will be 120 years. But if you calculate, Noah, when he had children, and when the flood comes,
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:46.040]   he had children when he had, it says in Genesis 5, that he was 500 years old, okay? And then the flood
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:55.300]   comes when he is 600 years old. So somewhere between those years, right? So it only tells us that when
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   he was 500, he had these three children. So it could be anywhere from 80 to 100 years, right?
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:11.900]   Probably not 100. Maybe 97, right? Because he needs nine months in between, right? And so somewhere around
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:19.500]   there. So let's say 80, between 80 and 100, so 90 years. Now, why is this significant? Because in 1 Peter
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:27.320]   3.20, in those 90 years, it says, these souls at that time were disobedient when the patience of God
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:32.480]   kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.860]   eight persons, were brought safely through the water, right? And it tells us in 2 Peter that
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:45.320]   that Noah was a preacher of righteousness. So during those 80, 90 years, Noah was preaching to them.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:52.960]   And in 1 Peter 3.20, it says, even as the plan of the flood was coming, God was giving them an
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:20:01.200]   opportunity to repent, right? You see that? Right? So right off the mat, as the judgment is coming,
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:08.280]   as people are dying, as sin is increasing, God's grace is continuing to pursue the sinners, okay?
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.340]   And so we see that even in the details of how the ark is described, what is allowed,
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:19.720]   all of these things are God's provision for mankind to be reconciled to him, okay?
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:32.360]   Okay. I don't know about you, but you probably noticed that detailed measurements or the timing,
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   right? In the description of Noah's ark, there's detailed measurements, and then here, it gives
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:43.880]   detailed timing, right? Everything is so precise, right? These are some of the things that I've listed,
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.180]   number one through six. You probably, there's more than this, but I just highlighted, right?
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:53.220]   It even tells us that the water lifted up how high? Do you remember?
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:21:03.500]   22 cubits above the highest mountain. Even that was measured, right? So why is, was it so important
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:10.880]   to measure every single detail, right? A couple of things I noted, that God is precise with his
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.360]   instructions on how we will be saved and lived, and so we talked about how he built the ark. Remember,
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:24.680]   where else are the measurements are so precise. The tabernacle and descriptions of the new heaven
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   and new earth, right? And so we see here, when we're talking about the very specific timing,
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:39.640]   timing, right? Where else is the timing, right? Where else is the timing very precise?
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:50.440]   Look at the book of Revelation, right? Seven days, right? Four, you know, half times half. When we describe,
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:57.640]   describe the book of Revelation, when it gets to the judgment, it's very precise with timing, right? So some may
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:04.200]   interpret that and say it's all allegorical, but if you were to take it literally, I mean, it's like there's so
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:11.800]   much, right? So much timing and measurement that's placed in the book of Revelation. And so if you see
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:19.240]   what's happening here at the ark, the flood, you can kind of see the similarities between what he is doing,
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:25.480]   how he is describing things at the ark at the end times, right? And that's why I think a literal
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.960]   interpretation, as much as possible, of the book of Revelation makes more sense. Because that's how it's
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:38.760]   fulfilled in the first time, okay? Same thing with the coming of Christ. Everything that Jesus said
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:47.320]   is first ought to be interpreted literally because that's how it was fulfilled, hanging on a cross,
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:53.240]   riding on a donkey, his servants scattering, all of these things that when it didn't happen may look
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:59.320]   like, oh, that could have been allegorical, but it actually happened literally, right? So again, it kind
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:04.680]   of mimics what's happening with God's judgment, and then the details support the validity of the historical
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:10.760]   events of the flood, right? If you're making up something, you wouldn't go into that much detail,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:18.280]   right? The details are there that may seem unnecessary. It's because it's true. It's a fact, right?
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:26.440]   In fact, a good example of that is a man named Sir William Ramsey. He's an archaeologist, historian,
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.200]   who set out to disprove the New Testament, especially the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts,
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.880]   because there's so many historical events and places that are mentioned only in Luke's writing.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.720]   So he set out that he's going to go and go to the details that are mentioned, that are mentioned nowhere
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.800]   else except for Luke's writings, and thinking that at the end of it, he's going to disprove. You see,
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:58.280]   if Luke's writings are fictional, then he can prove that what he's saying is also fictional,
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:04.840]   right? So at the end of his pursuit, he ended up becoming a Christian. And what he says, and there's
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.040]   many quotes from him, he says, "I began with a mind unfavorable to it, but more and more I found myself
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.560]   brought into contact with the accuracy of the New Testament." And another thing, I don't have the quote
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:22.360]   here, what he says, he said that it's very difficult for him to believe that Luke went to that much trouble
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:30.680]   to describe every little intricate details of the surroundings, of the place, of the particular event,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   if everything else he was saying was untrue, right? If he's making up the story of the resurrection,
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.320]   why would he describe everything around it to be true, right? And so at the end of that, after 30 years
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:49.320]   of digging, he ended up becoming a Christian because it doesn't make sense that so much of it would be so
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.920]   accurate to that detail. It would only make sense if everything that he was saying was true, okay?
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.360]   There's so many evidence of the flood. Instead of me describing it to you, I thought it'd be good if
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:11.160]   we can hear this. I don't know if we can hear this. Okay, again, I don't know what I'm doing with this,
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:15.160]   but I thought it'd be better if you just heard it instead of...
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:34.680]   There is no sound. Is there is it possible? Is it possible to have sound?
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:40.680]   The top five re... Okay, there you go. All right.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:50.760]   Ready? The top five reasons the global flood may have actually happened. Number five, human documented
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:55.880]   history of the flood. If a global flood happened, you'd expect people around the world in ancient
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:01.480]   history to have told this story. And they do. Basically, all the people. The Chinese, the Native
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.320]   Americans, the Hindi people, the Sumerians, the Greek, the Aztecs, the Norse people, the story of Atlantis,
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.240]   and of course, the biblical story, which is the account of the Jewish people. And their stories are
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.680]   largely similar. God or the gods were mad, and so they flooded the earth, while the hero of the story
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.760]   builds a boat and saved all the people and the animals. Number four, geologic evidence of a
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.400]   catastrophic flood. There is evidence all over the world of unfathomably massive flooding. For
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.760]   centuries, science taught us that everything we see was the - Can you flip it to the other, and then show it to them?
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.200]   Because this is my whole study today.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:41.640]   You're going to ruin the whole Bible study if this doesn't work.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.800]   There's a way to do it. Okay, give us one minute if we can't figure it out. Oh, so easy!
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.200]   I think you'll have to sync it up with them.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:05.240]   Wanna just start from the beginning?
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.360]   The top five reasons the global flood may have actually happened. Number five, human documented
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.480]   history of the flood. If a global flood happened, you'd expect people around the world in ancient
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:27.000]   history to have told this story. And they do. Basically, all the people. The Chinese, the Native
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.840]   Americans, the Hindi people, the Sumerians, the Greek, the Aztecs, the Norse people, the story of Atlantis,
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.680]   and of course, the biblical story, which is the account of the Jewish people. And their stories
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.880]   are largely similar. God or the gods were mad, and so they flooded the earth. While the hero of the
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:48.280]   story builds a boat and saved all the people and the animals. Number four, geologic evidence of a
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.560]   catastrophic flood. There is evidence all over the world of unfathomably massive flooding. For centuries,
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:58.120]   science taught us that everything we see was the result of slow, steady processes over deep time.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.880]   Until J. Harlan Bretz took on the scientific elites and proved the great ice dam flood of the Pacific
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:08.200]   Northwest. You can see the size of these small ripples that are the result of a local flood. And
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:12.440]   these pictures from the Camas Prairie in Idaho, which is in the path of this Missoula flood,
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.000]   has the same kind of ripples, but the scale is hundreds if not thousands of times larger.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.200]   Everybody knows the Niagara Falls. This is the Horseshoe Dam, compared to the Dry Falls
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:27.160]   formation in Washington, also part of this Missoula flood. The water at the Niagara Falls rushes over the
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:33.240]   edge at 200,000 cubic feet per second. While the water at this Dry Falls formation ravaged through at
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.400]   300 to 400 million cubic feet per second. Hundreds of times more water than the Niagara Falls. Imagine the
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.880]   scale. And now that we know that these formations were caused by catastrophic floods, science is finding
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.440]   evidence of these kinds of catastrophic floods all over the world, including two that are larger than
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:54.200]   the Missoula flood. Number three, oceans underneath the Earth's crust. One of the first questions that
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.680]   comes to mind when thinking of a global flood is where did the water come from? Which is a good
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.400]   question at surface level. But if you read the biblical account of Noah's flood, it's very clear where the
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:09.880]   water came from. Genesis 7:11, "In the 600th year of Noah's life, on the 17th day of the second month. On
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:17.160]   that day, all the springs of the great deep burst forth." Job 38:8, "Who shut up the sea behind doors when it
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:26.920]   burst forth from the womb?" Where did the water come from? The Bible clearly says that the floodwaters came from
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.960]   inside of the Earth, and scientists have potentially just recently found this water. They now estimate that
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.680]   there's more water underneath the Earth's crust than above. How did the author of the Bible get this
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.680]   right over 3,000 years ago? Good guess, Moses. Number two, the ice age. The fact that there was
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.440]   even an ice age at all provides strong evidence for a global flood. Why? We all have this idea of what the
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:53.480]   ice age was. The entire Earth covered in snow. But that's not the truth. The Earth was only about four
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:00.280]   degrees colder. However, up to 30% of the Earth was covered in ice. Glaciers, technically. Today, less than 5%
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.600]   of the Earth is covered in glaciers. So where did all the snow come from to cover 30% of the Earth?
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:10.760]   What do you need to form ice? Cold and water. If you only have cold, then you just have a cold age,
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:15.400]   not an ice age. Where did the precipitation come from? At the beginning of this last winter, Buffalo,
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.120]   New York, experienced the most massive blizzard in its recorded history, when a lake effect storm
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:25.800]   caused 60 inches of snow to encase the city. And how did this happen? Freezing cold arctic air moved south
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.280]   over the warm waters of the Great Lakes. The waters were still warm from the fall, and as the cold air
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:35.240]   passes over the warm water, it causes evaporation, precipitation. And in the Buffalo Blizzard, this
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:40.680]   created a conveyor belt of snow, as the warm waters meeting the cold air caused the formation of clouds
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.160]   and precipitation. And this can explain where the water for the ice age came from. Models show that if
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.560]   there was a global flood, this event would have created a tremendous amount of energy or heat,
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:54.200]   largely due to friction. This heat would have dissipated into, and of course, heated up the
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:31:01.160]   oceans, creating this lake effect phenomenon, but on a global scale. Number one evidence that a global
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:07.160]   flood may have actually happened: the fossil record. How is a fossil formed? When an animal dies,
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:12.360]   the scavengers almost immediately get to work on beginning the process of disassembling the formerly
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.800]   living thing. And this is just the beginning phase of its total decomposition, finished off by bugs,
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:23.560]   bacteria, and fungi. It's gross, but it's an amazing system for recycling organic material. Because of
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:29.480]   the efficacy of this recycling process, dead animals stand basically no chance at being preserved in any
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:35.000]   complete or articulated way. And this is why, in order for something to become a fossil, it basically
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.440]   needs to be rapidly buried by mud or sand, which helps to make sense of the fossils of animals that died
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:46.040]   while eating, giving birth, and that are found in death poses, arched back before being rapidly
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.920]   covered by mud, sometimes sand. So the very fact that fossils are found all over the earth is
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:57.640]   compelling evidence for a global, rapid animal-bearing event, like a flood. It also explains why marine
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:03.160]   fossils, like whales and sharks, have been found in the middle of deserts, and also on the top of Mount
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:09.480]   Everest, the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world. So what do you think? Did a global flood actually happen?
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:36.680]   All right, I got a couple more slides before we end, okay? So this is a picture of, how many of you guys have been here in Kentucky?
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:44.120]   There's an actual replica that they made of, I think they call it the Creation Museum, right?
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:51.320]   It's the Creation Museum, right? Anyway, this is in Kentucky, and they made the actual size of it.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:57.080]   And I wanted to give you an idea of how big the ark is in feet, because we don't do centimeters, right?
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:06.600]   It's about 450 feet long, about 75 feet wide, and about 30 feet high, right?
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:13.400]   So many guys who are not good with measurements, our sanctuary is about 100 feet sideways,
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:19.240]   and about 70 feet length, right? From the pulpit to the back where the
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:27.160]   AV room is, right? It's about 70 feet. And then the length, the width of it is 700 feet,
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:34.760]   about 100 feet, about 90 some feet. And it's about 20 to 22 feet high, which means if you look at the total
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:41.640]   volume, it would be about five times the size of our sanctuary, okay? And it was built in three decks,
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:48.920]   right? And so the natural question that I had when I was younger, when I was looking through this,
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:53.560]   is that could they have actually fit all these animals? According to, again, I'm not going to go
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:34:00.200]   into too much details, but according to a study, they said majority of the animals on earth, even today,
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.480]   are the size of a small dog or smaller, majority of them. So when we think of animals, we're thinking
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.080]   elephants and buffaloes and all these things, but when you actually calculate the size of the animals,
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.680]   majority of them are the size of a dog or smaller. And then on top of that, if you calculate
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:23.960]   like the language of what it says, it says all of the birds of their kind, right? It doesn't necessarily
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:31.880]   mean every single species. It means of their kind, right? And so according to the volume of what the
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:38.200]   size of this boat would have carried, most people believe that it was probably even just volume-wise,
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:45.960]   it would have only taken about 25% or less, okay? So is it possible? Yes, it's possible, right? And so
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.800]   I just wanted to throw that out there, because this is something that I asked when I was younger,
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.520]   looking at this, it's like, it's crazy to think that all the animals like fit into that boat,
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.560]   but considering the size of the boat, the volume of the boat, and the volume of all the animals put
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:08.760]   together, it could have easily done that, okay? And in chapter 8, verse 1, before the flood actually
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.960]   comes, he said God remembered Noah. Now obviously, when he says he remembered, it doesn't mean like he
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:18.760]   told him to build the ark, and then just, oh, that's right, I forgot about Noah, right? Clearly,
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.360]   that's not what he means, right? He means that the covenant that he made, that he was going to save
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:31.080]   mankind through Noah, that he keeps his promise, right? And that's the theme all throughout redemptive
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:36.520]   history, it's God remembers, God remembers, God remembers, right? Meaning that what he was doing
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:42.120]   in the creation, what he's doing with Noah, what he is doing with Israel, what he's doing, he does not
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.480]   forget. He does not change his mind. God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:53.160]   repent, right? Has he not said it, and will he not do it? If God said it, he will do it, even though it
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:59.480]   may seem as impossible, when you lose all hope, right? Because you just cannot see, well, how can God do
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:05.880]   this, and why would God do this? He says God remembers, right? So what he is doing here with Noah, what he is
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:11.000]   doing with the nation of Israel, he says he will remember, and you see that all throughout redemptive
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.800]   history. God never changes his mind or his purpose, okay? And he, and Book of Hebrews says, nor can he do
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:24.840]   so, he cannot change, right? Which means when he says, tells us to remember, obviously we have a tendency
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:30.680]   to forget, but he, when he tells us to remember, he's telling us more than just think about it. He's,
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:36.120]   he's telling us to be faithful to the covenant, because God is faithful to us, that we are to remember,
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:46.200]   and to be faithful to him, okay? This physical, uh, I remember the very first movie that my dad took us
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:53.480]   to in Philadelphia in 1975, when we came to the United States. He made such a big deal, and we went to the
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:00.840]   theater, so excited, and there was a documentary on how they found Noah's Ark on the mountain of
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:09.080]   Turkey, and we didn't even understand English at that time. So I remember to vow never to watch an
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:14.760]   American movie again, because if this is what an American movie looks like, right? But there's so
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:19.640]   many, so many documentaries of people looking for it, and I don't actually have pictures, but they do
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:26.360]   think, okay, again, it's not proven that somewhere in Turkey that they have a place where it looks like,
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.320]   whether they found wood pieces, or the shape of it, and sitting on the top of one of the mountains
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.960]   over there. Um, if you Google it, you'll easily find it. There's tons of pictures, okay?
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:44.360]   So the fact that God left evidence, right? And my guess is, by the time Moses was riding it,
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.200]   Moses knew exactly where this boat was. That's my thought, right? Because it's not that far removed.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:58.280]   Okay. Uh, next question. God was so clear about how to build the ark, and what to collect, and yet when
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:03.400]   it was time to exit the ark, right, Noah had to go through all this ritual of finding, is it dry,
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:08.920]   is it not? Uh, why do you think God didn't give specific instructions after the flood? Now, again,
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.920]   this is just conjecture, uh, but if you look at the pattern in which God works, there's a tendency
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.720]   to people think that whenever you see God working a certain way that that's how God's going to work
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:28.920]   in every single instance, right? God spoke to, you know, to Paul. God spoke to Moses. And so you're
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.200]   waiting, I'm waiting for God to speak to me. Is that the typical pattern in which God works is through the
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:43.400]   prophets through the written word, right? And so God was very engaged with, with them early on, even,
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.960]   even in Noah's life. It wasn't like every single day God gave specific instruction, do this, turn left,
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:54.040]   turn right. And, uh, I remember, especially in the charismatic camp, they think that whatever you see
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.400]   is a pattern that, that needs to be repeated. But I remember two of my roommates who were very charismatic,
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.760]   who are older than me, uh, right before they got married, I remember them being so disappointed.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.040]   And the reason why they were disappointed is because they thought that God was going to give
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:16.440]   them some special revelation as to who they were supposed to marry. But that never happened. So they
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.160]   were thinking, huh, this is not what we thought. And at the end, the end conclusion of both of them,
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:26.920]   two separate times being married was, oh, this is just, I just need to make a wise, godly choice,
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:33.880]   right? Um, the whole reason why I point this out is because even Noah, how God spoke to him in the
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:39.080]   beginning and at the end was very different. Okay. This is not a normal pattern that we are to wait for,
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.440]   like God for me to speak and say, do you want me to do this? Or do you want me to do that? Right?
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:50.920]   God says to not to conform to the pattern of this world, but renew your mind that you may be able to
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:56.760]   test and approve the will of God, that which is perfect and good. Right? So we are by renewing
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:03.400]   our mind through the word of God, through repentance, that, that we are to be able to discern the will of
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:10.840]   God. Right? So God's given that to us. And then you see right off the bat, Noah built an altar,
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.040]   offered a burnt offering, and once they exited, where in the Bible does it, does this come out?
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:22.280]   Obviously, Leviticus chapter one. So right off the bat, the sacrifices teach that sin requires death.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:28.440]   Right? Sin requires death, right? That's one of the first things that is taught in the sacrificial system.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.920]   That it is a bloody scene at the altar, that they are being slaughtered, and the blood is being
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.960]   sprinkled everywhere. The fact that this was given not only at the tabernacle, but this was being
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:46.600]   practiced from the very beginning. Sin requires death. God provided a way to live, right? Through the
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:52.040]   sacrifice of the animals that they were atoned for, right? By faith, knowing that the true atonement was
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:57.880]   going to come in Christ. And then again, the blood atonement was necessary, right? Without the shedding of
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:04.360]   blood, there is no forgiveness of sins, right? And so this was embedded from the beginning, right?
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.000]   In Genesis chapter three, it says the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.120]   And so the specifics of that, even though it doesn't mention it there, the specifics of the coming of
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:21.400]   Christ was embedded into their daily practice, right? And so we see that right off the bat, as soon as
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:28.840]   Noah comes up, the first thing that he does is he offers sacrifice, right? One, out of thanksgiving, but two,
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.160]   he knew that this was the only way that he can have a relationship with this holy God, okay? So all of
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:41.880]   this is preparation for the coming of Christ, okay? All right, so this is the study question for chapter
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.760]   nine. I'm not going to go through it. I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:53.000]   And then here's the discussion questions, okay? Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you go to get to
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:05.000]   your discussion. Father, we thank you for your mercies. We thank you, Father God, that you do remember
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.240]   that everything that you have chosen to do and will to do, that you do, that you are faithful to your
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:19.560]   promises, whether it is to Noah, to his family, to Israel, to the church, to us, that our confidence
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:27.080]   may not come, Lord God, because of who we are, but because of who you are. Help us, Lord God, to ground our
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:37.240]   faith firmly upon an unchanging love of who you are, and help us to even understand, Lord God, that we are
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:43.400]   living in a period of grace, knowing that one day, that even though it may not be through a flood, that
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:49.800]   the judgment will come. So help us, Lord God, to live like people who are preparing and being ready, that we
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:55.480]   may not be caught off like a thief coming in the night. So we ask, Lord God, that you would bless this time of
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:10.040]   discussion. Sanctify us and renew us, Lord God, through this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.040]   Amen.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Amen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Amen.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Amen.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Amen.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Amen.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Amen.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Amen.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Amen.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.040]   Amen.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:48.020]   Thank you.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:44:18.000]   Thank you.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:31.740]   Thank you.
