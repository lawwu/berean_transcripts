[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.380]   This is my testimony.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.700]   Do you believe in God?
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.400]   It's a question I've wrestled with for a long time.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.540]   If you asked me that question
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.060]   at different points in my life,

[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.180]  But, with this moment, I finally heard that phone ring.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:15.380]  It was the wake-up call encouraging me to question everything, and above all else, I found a world defiled by man, riddled with imperfection, evil, and selfish to its core.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.820]  I didn't have to look very far to find it, because it was everywhere.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:24.840]  But, for every awful thing I noticed, I would question how those things spoke to my character.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.420]  If humanity had many faults, even at its best, how
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.300]   much more true would that be?
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:59.280]   and how much more true would that be?
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:29.300]  , and how much more true would that be?
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   The first thing I realized was that I was unwell, and it was unbearable.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.320]   The second thing I realized was that I was unwell, and it was unbearable.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   The second thing I realized was that I was unwell, and it was unbearable.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   The second thing I realized was that I was unwell, and it was unbearable.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   The second thing I realized was that if there was nothing in this world that could save me, I would not be able to be able to do what I was saying what I was saying.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.500]   The second thing I realized was that if there was nothing in this world that could save me, I would not be able to be able to do what I was saying what I was saying what I was saying.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.500]  I needed to find my peace somewhere else, and I was told I could find it in Christ.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:59.360]   I started working, praying, hoping to earn that peace, because I wanted to cleanse a soul that was far murkier than I had ever known it to be. But no matter what I did, I didn't feel any clearer. I told myself I believed and was sure of it in my mind, but my heart was wavering. So even as I sat in these seats and sang these songs, I felt like I was on borrowed time. Although I was ready to receive now, I felt like I was lacking something.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   I felt like I was lacking something.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   I felt like I was lacking something.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Although I was ready to receive now, I felt like I was lacking something.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:29.400]   and after trying what this world offered to no avail, I couldn't see myself turning back. I was at odds with opposing powers and felt stuck. It wasn't until the membership interview with PPC when he would remind me of the most fundamental part of the Gospel: faith. For someone who studied Martin Luther so much, it's surprisingly easy to forget that faith justifies sinners like us, but it was the first time after hundreds of hearings that it finally started to make sense. With PPC's encouragement, I asked God to change my life and I was able to believe that I was able to believe in the world and I was able to believe in the world, and I was able to believe in the world that I was able to believe in the world.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.440]   and I was able to believe in the world that I was able to believe in the world that I was able to believe in the world.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440]   I can't say one thing with certainty. While I merely asked for this not long ago, I did not feel remotely the same.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   I can't say one thing with certainty. While I merely asked for this not long ago, I did not feel remotely the same.

[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   Right now, throughout the school boards, if the teacher refuses to call a child who's in every way male and says,
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   Oh, I'm not a male, and then don't address him the way they want to be addressed, basically you can get fired for that.

[00:43:53.340 --> 00:44:08.420]   In Mark, chapter 11, verse 13-14, Jesus condemns this fig tree. And in this fig tree he says, "Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if perhaps he would find
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:08.500]   the fig tree in leaf, he went to see if perhaps he would find

[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.580]   Remember the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in the book of Acts?
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.720]   Early on, the Holy Spirit comes upon the church and people are so excited.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.380]   They were selling all their possessions.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.260]   They were distributing to the poor.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.940]   Ananias and Sapphira has an idea.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.340]   They sell their possession, but they only turn in a portion of it.

Fake righteousness. Pretending to be something that they're not. That's what he was condemning Israel for with this fig tree. You present yourself to be righteou.

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   So if we're not careful, we can have a church filled with people who are pretty pigs.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   True discipleship happens when there's an internal transformation, when a bad tree
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   becomes a good tree.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   In Jeremiah 13, 23, it says, Can the Ethiopian change his skin color or skin or the leopard, his spot? Then you also can do good who are accustomed to doing good.

[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   And that's what we're talking about.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   You don't have to be a good friend with the person you're

[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   You can talk to them about their presentation with no real

[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   So we have to fundamentally ask the question, what causes
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   change in people?
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   True change, right?
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   Not just guilt.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   Some people come to church out of superstition because you
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   grew up in the church all your life and if you don't go to
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200]   church, God's not going to bless you.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   He's not going to answer your prayers.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   So you have to go to church.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   So you have to go and check off Mark, right?
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   So those of you who are coming to church out of obligation,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   the church is not going to bless you.

[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:01.120]   You never painted outside the line, ever.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.140]   You never painted outside the line, ever.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.320]   0.0001%, right?
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.640]   Most of you guys don't care,
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.160]   but I know there's some, you know,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.800]   there's some people in here that bothers you
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   and that's going to ruin the whole sermon.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.720]   Right?
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.640]   In John chapter 3, 1,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.980]   and he asked that question, he says,
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.840]   Jesus answered and said to him,
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.000]   truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.820]   unless one is born again,
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.680]   he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.420]   What is he saying?
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.240]   He said, unless there's a complete transformation
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.160]   of who you are,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   unless there's a complete transformation of who you are,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   unless there's a complete transformation of who you are,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   unless there's a complete transformation of who you are,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   unless there's a complete transformation of who you are,
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   unless there's a complete transformation of who you are,
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:42.140]   found
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:33.400]   ginger
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   and
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.400]   and
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:27.440]   and
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:27.460]   and
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:27.560]   and
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:27.620]   and
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:27.700]   and
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.440]   our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.980]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.580]   when infinite joy is offered to us.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:42.140]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:46.720]   because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.260]   at the sea.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   I think that we are far too easily pleased. For whatever the reason we think we are justified by grace but our sanctification is going to happen by hard work. It doesn't mean that hard work isn't required of us but what justifies us will also sanctify us and eventually lead us to glory. It is confronting and being encountered by the beauty of Christ that changes. That is what being confronted by the beauty of Christ that changes. That is what being confronted by the beauty of Christ that changes. That is what
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.280]  .
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   It is confronting and being encountered by the beauty of Christ that changes. That is what
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.280]  .
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:28.660]  ë…
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:45.560]   when the,,RET You Hell Ð¸Ð·Ð¼ÐµÐ½ mean even you want to be
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:04:14.340]  GGåŒ
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:05:13.900]  , "I just can't, I cannot, you don't know what I'm like." And all of a sudden you have a child then you become a different person. What changed you? Love for your child changed you. Love changes all of us. And those are lesser kind of love that the whole world experiences but the love that he's talking about is the greatest of all love. Where he, "God the Father sent his only begotten son." There is no love greater than this, that a friend lay down his life for his friend.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:06:11.480]  obediently, love is at the front. Because it is love that produces joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. And against such things there is no law. If you try to pretend to be joyous without love, it's a fake smile. Right? People always, you know, like make fun of me because my smile, I always smile with my mouth but my eyes are the same.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:11.600]   ,, ,, ,, .
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:40.400]  . It's like a little kid, my kids used to smile that way. Some of you guys smile that way. Right? Your eyes are still the same, it doesn't move. My eyes are frozen but my lips go up, right? We're trying to fake joy, right? You know at our church we have so many weddings and people often ask me, like how many weddings have you done? I counted over 150 throughout the years. I've officiated over 150 weddings and so people ask me, "Do you want to do this or do that?"
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.200]   do that?"
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.900]   I've officiated over 150 weddings and so people often ask me, "Don't you get tired of weddings?"
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.300]   Never.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.740]   Honest truth, I never get tired of weddings.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.140]   You know why?
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.200]   Because that's the happiest place on earth.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.540]   Not this fake place in Anaheim.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:57.100]   This is like the happiest place, happiest place on earth.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.000]   Yes, yes.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.340]   .
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.600]   All right.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   I saw who clapped.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.740]   Okay, so you guys.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:15.060]   I
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:31.940]   not, Ð“ M write,er,,,,,'s piece...'
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   I'm not gonna say it's not intentional or we need to be intentional you don't have to be intentional you can't help but talk about God because that's what's losing out because that's what's filled your heart with Christ you tell somebody who's in love with Christ go evangelize try to stop them from evangelizing they can't help but to share with other people that's what he means that's why he says the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind saying love your neighbors as yourself and if you have that right it produces joy peace
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.460]  obediently pure which is important
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:23.860]   but we need to be doctrinally pure for what reason so that we can have love you know why because the beauty of Christ is the gospel so if you pervert the gospel you pervert the beauty of Christ if you pervert the gospel you've taken something so beautiful and you threw mud at it and so what produces love in us what produces truth in us and what produces love in us is love
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:53.880]  , you've muddied it so people no longer see the beauty they see your work they see your design they see your design they see idols that's why perverting the gospel is so detrimental to the church because they no longer are able to see the beauty that was presented in us in the pure gospel the goal of this commandment it says is love that's why Paul says in Colossians 129 for this purpose I also
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   the beauty that was presented in us in the pure gospel the goal of this commandment it says is love that's why Paul says in Colossians 129 for this purpose I also
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   the beauty that was presented in us in the pure gospel the goal of this commandment it says is love that's why Paul says in Colossians 129 for this purpose I also
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   the beauty that was presented in us in the pure gospel the goal of this commandment it says is love that's why Paul says in Colossians 129 for this purpose I also
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:10:02.760]   which mightily works within me he says he's laboring because of how he's
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.220]   been affected not simply out of duty not simply to change people's
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:23.900]   behavior it filmed out I found that this this discipleship really worked if we do it this way no there's only one way that people actually change really change from a bad tree to a good tree is when they encounter the beauty of Christ that's why the primary
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   it's when they encounter the beauty of Christ that's why the primary
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   it's when they encounter the beauty of Christ that's why the primary
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   that's why the primary

[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:35.220]   And we feel like that with a lesser love.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.980]   How much more when we meet Christ the pure love.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:43.020]   Pure love of Christ the superlative love.
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.220]   And we commit that's the love I want.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:50.180]   For the rest of my life. I'm not going to look at anything else.

[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.840]   And then you know what the remedy to that is?
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   And then you know what the remedy to that is?
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   Remember.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]   Remember.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   Remember the height from which you have fallen.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840]   Remember the height from which you have fallen.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.840]   He doesn't say work harder.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   He doesn't say be more disciplined.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   He doesn't say work harder.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840]   He doesn't say be more disciplined.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   He said remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840]   He said remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   He said remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840]   Before you knew anything.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840]   Before you knew anything.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840]   Before you had anything to present.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840]   Before you had anything to present.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840]   Remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840]   Remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840]   Remember when you first met Christ.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   Go back to that.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   Go back to that.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   Before you were theologically astute,
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:13:07.380]   Before you memorized all of these scriptures,
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   Before you were theologically astute,
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.380]   When you first met Christ and you encountered
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.380]   the beauty of Christ and all you could think of
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.380]   was this is what I want the rest of my life.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:11.880]   This is all I want for eternity.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Remember that that you fell from.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   Repent from your empty works.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.920]   That's the only thing that I want to find out from you.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.420]   That's the only thing that I want to find out from you.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   Did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:15.920]   Did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.420]   Did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   Are you so foolish having begun by the spirit?
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.420]   Are you so foolish having begun by the spirit?
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.420]   Are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.420]   Are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   Are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.420]   The same beauty of Christ that justified us is the same beauty of Christ that sanctifies us.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   The same beauty of Christ that justified us is the same beauty of Christ that sanctifies us.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   in the same way that we want to become more like him, when we want more of him, we change.

[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   It becomes an ugly place where everybody's just looking at each other to see who's doing what and who's not doing what.

[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:53.340]   We started the Bible so that we can have a greater glimpse of his glory. So understand him better. What is this love? Why would he do such a thing? Why would he remember me? Why would he be so gracious to me? And for the rest of our life, we're trying to have a better understanding of what we already have in Christ. That's what Bible study is.

[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.

[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320]   I'm going to read a little bit of what he said.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:11.360]   "In other words, when he says, 'You're not blessed if you do this,' if you walk according to the pattern of this world, you're going to be miserable.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   But who are the blessed?
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   Blessed are those who delight in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night."
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.360]   Now, you may look at that superficially and say, 'Well, I love studying the Bible.'
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   Is that what he's talking about?
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.360]   Right?
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.360]   Some of you guys like reading and some of you guys don't.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   So if you don't like reading, you're in trouble.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   Why does he delight in the law of the Lord?
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   Some people delight in the law of the Lord because they love talking about theology.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   Why does he delight in the law of the Lord?
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360]   Some people delight in the law of the Lord because they love studying the law of the Lord because they love studying the Bible.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:27.400]   You're talking about theology.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   Because they're competing with other people.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   I read more.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   I know more.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   I can argue more.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   I'm not knocking theology because theology is what causes us to see his glory.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   Right?
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   I'm not knocking theology.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   But if you pursue theology so that you can be better at theology, you're missing the whole
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   point.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   That's not what he's saying.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   Why does he delight in the law of the Lord?
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:19:22.440]   "He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God."
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.440]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he delights in God.
