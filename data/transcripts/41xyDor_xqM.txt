[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:36.980]   Amen.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.600]   Welcome to Brink Community Church.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.520]   Sorry, it's been a while since I've been up here.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.780]   What happened?
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.540]   All right, there it is.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.980]   Okay.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.160]   First of all, as you can see, we have Communion Sunday today.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.460]   So I hope you guys came prepared for the sacred time.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.580]   We mentioned to you how Lachie is going to be open soon.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.000]   And starting today, Lachie is going to be reopened.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.580]   So that's a lot where our shuttle was going before.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.100]   But because we had some issues there, we kind of cut it off for a while.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.120]   But starting from today, Lachie is going to be open.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.600]   But not only on Sunday, but Lachie will be open on Fridays and Wednesdays as well.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   So going forward, our Bible study time on when we pick up our Bible study, Lachie will be open.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.700]   The shuttles will be going there.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.840]   And also on Friday, when we have praise and prayer, Lachie will be reopened.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.420]   So Lachie will also be open.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.380]   That's a lot that was open with that big parking lot.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.100]   On Sundays, the shuttles will be going there also, but only on Sundays.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.080]   Okay.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.100]   But Lachie on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, there will be parking allowed there.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.480]   Okay, so just keep that in mind.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.680]   And then our Bible study, our Foundations of Redemptive History through the Book of Genesis,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.080]   Chapter 1 through 11, is beginning soon on September 3rd.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.060]   So those of you who are small group leaders and home group leads, the week prior to that,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.160]   on Wednesday, we have a dinner.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.420]   So you should have gotten an invitation for that.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.300]   So if you haven't responded to that, please respond as soon as possible.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.420]   If you have not signed up yet, today is the last day that you're going to be able to sign up
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.760]   where we're going to be able to place you in certain places.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.280]   Okay.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.160]   So if you sign up after today, we're going to end up having to place you wherever it's open.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.720]   So if you sign up after today and say, hey, can I go into this Bible study?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.980]   We will not be able to do that.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.900]   Or can I enter into this home group?
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.100]   We will not be able to do that.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.620]   Okay.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.160]   So if you haven't signed up, please sign up by today.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.680]   And then the sign up will still be open, but you won't be able to choose where you go.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.280]   So some of you may end up going to the newcomer's Bible study
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.480]   if we do not have enough space.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.500]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.720]   So if you haven't signed up, please do it by today.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.660]   And then lastly, this coming Saturday, we have a men's ministry gathering at 9 a.m.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.660]   And the topic is going to be Christians in the workplace.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.800]   So there's going to be a brief teaching on this subject.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.120]   And then we're going to have some of the older men in our church
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.340]   who's going to be in part of the panel discussion.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.020]   And so you'll be able to ask some questions.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:28.040]   This is one of those topics that are, you know, are asked all the time, right?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.940]   And whether you are a young Christian or you've been a Christian for a long time,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.800]   whether you're married or you have many children,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   one of the questions is how do we incorporate?
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.980]   How do we see our workplace and our Christian faith?
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.060]   And so how do we redeem that for God's glory?
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.200]   And so that's the subject of the topic this coming Saturday.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.220]   So please come by 9 a.m.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.740]   If you sign up after today, the cost of the lunch is going to go up to 15
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.720]   because they're already preparing.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.160]   And so if today is the last day where the cost will be 10,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.140]   and then after today it will be 15 because we would have to move things around
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.880]   and buy more stuff for that.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.620]   So please do that as soon as possible.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.400]   Okay.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.160]   All right.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.320]   I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.420]   Why don't we take some time to pray for the offering?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.160]   And then if you have a physical offering to give,
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   we have an offering box in the back that you can visit on your way out.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.160]   All right.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.520]   Let's pray.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.940]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.540]   We thank you, Lord God, for the privilege that we have
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.460]   to be able to gather together as a church,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.200]   to seek you,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.220]   to express our appreciation and love to you,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.360]   to worship you, Lord God,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.380]   to the best of our ability in spirit and in truth.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.280]   I pray, Father,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.460]   that your word would continue to bear fruit in our hearts.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.600]   I pray that when we sing,
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.960]   that we would sing honestly,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.160]   with truth and spirit,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.360]   expression of our gratitude toward you.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.180]   I pray that we would hear your word
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.420]   with open and ready hearts, Lord God,
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.220]   not just to hear, but to apply.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.740]   I pray that even in this giving,
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.040]   help us to give as an act of worship.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.980]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100 for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.860]   Amen.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:11:00.160]   Let us pray.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.340]   Let us all rise, and I'll spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:12:00.120]   Let us pray.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:30.100]   Let us pray.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:13:00.080]   Let us pray.

[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:59.800]   That we may be the light that we may be the light that we may be the light that you've called us to be.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:29.780]   Let us pray.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:59.760]   Let us pray.
