[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.520]   When I went to church, I was focused more on having fun with my friends and filling the time in my day, more than I was thinking about the content of the Sunday lessons.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:49.260]   I thought that I was a good kid, and I tried to answer all the questions during Sunday school, but I never gave much thought to what it all meant and how my life played a role in what God wanted for me.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:55.620]   When I was eight, my family moved from New York to California, and I was introduced to a new environment, new church, and new people.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:02.500]   For me, things didn't really feel all that different. I was still going to church every Sunday, listening to sermons, having discussion afterwards.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.100]   However, I still just wanted to have fun and spend time with my friends. I didn't feel any sense of urgency or really grasp the reality of my sin.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.960]   Romans 3.23 states that,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:23.240]   Oftentimes, when I heard this verse, I thought that it was such an obvious statement, that nobody is perfect and everybody falls into sin.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.940]   But, when I look back on my own actions and thoughts, I see that I really didn't understand the reality of that verse.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:37.280]   I understood that I wasn't perfect, but I still placed myself above others, thinking that I was better than them, and that I wasn't really that bad of a person.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.860]   I didn't think that I'd done anything severe enough, that I deserved the judgment and wrath which every sinner deserves.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:50.140]   Even in cases of what I saw as, quote, smaller sins, I thought that I could overcome them on my own.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:56.340]   I thought that I could be a morally good person by my own choice, and that I had some sense of control over my own salvation.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:03.360]   Even in the times when I prayed, I simply acknowledged the fact that I had sinned, and said that I would do better next time.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.140]   But there was no genuine request for reconciliation or forgiveness from God.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:13.160]   I wasn't repenting, but simply asking God to help me to be stronger, to make me a better person.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.100]   In my prayer, there was so much emphasis on me that it wasn't really prayer at all, but it was just me showcasing my pride.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:33.820]   I was learning myself to think that I was seeking His forgiveness and acting like a Christian, but really I was just focusing on what I could do, on my own ability and power, living how I wanted to, and essentially trying to be saved upon my own terms.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:44.740]   This perspective changed when I got into high school, and I was surrounded by a lot of influences and people who, many of them were non-Christians, and I was surrounded by even more temptation.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:55.500]   I fell into temptation of rebelling against my parents, looking at content that I wasn't supposed to, lying, and at the forefront of all of this was my sense of pride.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:05.460]   I had so much pride in this idea that I was inherently a good person, and I made myself an exception, even though I saw myself falling into sin constantly.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:13.600]   I clung to the idea that all I had to do to be saved was make myself a better person, and I could achieve salvation by myself.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:22.420]   I refused to swallow my pride and let go of my sin, and I tried to fight against it by my own power, and I ended up falling deeper and deeper into it.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:31.060]   Thankfully, through God's grace, He was working with the people in my life to help me realize the gravity of my sin and to come to repentance.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:41.040]   I am thankful for all the people who are facing my life to help me come to this point, through all my youth group teachers, my parents, my friends, my family,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.840]   who's kept me in their prayers and helped me walk.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:54.540]   I remember distinctly, recently, during March, our youth group retreat, I was reflecting more and more on my sin,
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.500]   and just how much I was unable to change myself to be better and escape my sin.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:07.240]   I realized that the only thing that could save me was to pray to God and to recognize and acknowledge my own sinfulness
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.660]   and to understand the fact that His forgiveness and power was the only thing that could save me.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:19.580]   After the retreat, when I got home, I talked to my parents over the things I had learned during the retreat,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:27.100]   and I also confessed to them my sin and that I wanted to pray with them and to repent and accept Christ as my Savior.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.780]   We prayed that night very tearfully, and I confessed to God my sins.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:38.420]   But this time, instead of pride, I came to Him in humility, asking Him for His forgiveness,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.060]   and praying that I would rely on Him instead of my own strength,
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.840]   praying that He would help me to learn more of Him and to rescue me from my sinful state.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:55.500]   And although I still struggle with my sin, I no longer rely on my own strength to try and prove myself worthy of salvation.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:03.680]   But I come before God humbly to ask His forgiveness first, and to continue to strengthen my faith in Him.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.500]   Ephesians 2, 8-9 says,
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.620]   For by grace, you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.240]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.680]   My salvation is not because of any deed or work which I have accomplished,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.640]   but because of the grace of God, who has forgiven me and rescued me from my sins,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.380]   and He has called me one of His own children.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.380]   Thank you.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:58.360]   Thank you.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:05.340]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.340]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.340]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.340]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:28.320]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.300]   All I can say is, wow, thank you.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   Because I know that, you know, just obviously Dean and Helen are a very integral part of our church.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   And they've been here at a church for over 10 years.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   And obviously, I mean, many of you know how well and how vigorously they serve our church.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:55.280]   And I know that every time I've met with Dean and Helen that the topic of their prayer was always for their children.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.280]   And to see God answering prayer with Jeremy.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.260]   And again, just thank God for his mercies and grace.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   Again, congratulations for all the Shin family.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.260]   For God's continued grace and mercy in your lives.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.260]   And again, what a blessing to all of us to be able to witness God's miraculous work.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.260]   You know, when the scripture says if you have faith that you can move mountains.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.260]   You know, the physical mountain is easy to move.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:26.260]   But to actually change the heart of a man, a sinful person, to come to Christ, that really is a miracle of God.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.260]   And so again, thank you for allowing us to participate and to witness that.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:37.260]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 11, we'll be reading from verse 37 to verse 44.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.260]   Luke chapter 11, verse 37 to 44.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.260]   Okay.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.260]   This is all part of one text all the way to verse 54.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.260]   But I'm going to just be reading to 44 today.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.260]   Now, when he had spoken, a Pharisee asked him to have lunch with him.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.260]   And he went in and reclined at the table.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:01.260]   When the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that he had not first ceremonially washed before the meal.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.260]   But the Lord said to him,
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.260]   Now, you Pharisees, clean the outside of the cup and of the platter.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   But inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.260]   You foolish ones, did not he who made the outside make the inside also?
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   But woe to you Pharisees, for you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   and yet disregard justice and the love of God.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.260]   But these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:37.260]   Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:43.260]   Woe to you, for you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.260]   Let's pray.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.260]   Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.260]   We thank you for answered prayers.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.260]   We thank you, Father God, for tangible evidence of your presence in our lives.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   Help us to understand this text.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.260]   Help us to understand your heart.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.260]   Lord God, why you are so harsh with the leaders of Israel.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   Help us to heed your warning and your encouragement through this text.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.260]   Amen.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   You know, modern day, you know, we get a lot of invitations to come and join a conference.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.260]   Right?
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.260]   We had our leaders and some of our people go to a conference just this year.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.260]   And I know some of you guys have gone to a conference recently.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.260]   But typically, if you get an invitation, there's a big conference coming.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.260]   The first thing that we look at is who is speaking.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.260]   Right?
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   Is it John Piper?
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.260]   Is it MacArthur?
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260]   Is it Paul Washer?
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   Some of our favorite speakers in our generation.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   And based on that, we'll go.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.260]   We'll listen to them.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.260]   We get encouraged and we get challenged.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:57.260]   But can you imagine if the Messiah showed up and with all the proof, all the evidence,
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.260]   fulfilled, Christ himself fulfilled over 50 different prophecies about him coming.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.260]   And then everything he does, the performance of miracles, proved that he was the Messiah.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.260]   And that Messiah shows up at the conference and say, "You brood of vipers," to these men
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.260]   of God that we think are the men of God.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.260]   We've been coming to listen to them, get counsel and be fed by them.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.260]   And then all of a sudden, our Messiah rebukes them.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.260]   How would you feel?
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.260]   Probably shocked, confused, maybe asking questions.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.260]   Is he the real Messiah?
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   And if he is the real Messiah, that means all this time that we were wrong, we were led astray.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   Who is right?
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.260]   Who is wrong?
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.260]   Probably that's what would happen.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.260]   I think that's a good picture of what is happening here.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.260]   Jesus is singling out the Pharisees.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.260]   These are the people who they thought were the spiritual leaders.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.260]   If they had questions about the law, these are the people that they went to.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   If they went to the synagogue and was asking about concerns about their marriage.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.260]   What is right?
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.260]   What is wrong?
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.260]   How to understand?
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.260]   How to apply the word of God?
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   What does it mean to honor God?
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.260]   They are the ones that they went to to ask questions.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   But over and over again, Jesus singles out the leaders of Israel.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.260]   So you brutal vipers.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.260]   In fact, this is not new in Christ.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.260]   If you read the Old Testament, especially in the prophets.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.260]   Over and over again, he singles out the leaders.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:33.260]   He blames the waywardness of the nation of Israel on the leadership of Israel.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:40.260]   He says in Jeremiah 23:16-18, "Thus says the Lord of hosts,
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.260]   Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.260]   They are leading you into futility.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.260]   They speak of a vision of their own imagination, not from the mouth of the Lord.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.260]   They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The Lord has said, 'You will have peace.'
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.260]   They say, 'Calamity will not come upon you.'
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.260]   But who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, that he should see and hear his word?
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   Who has given heed to his word and listened?"
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.260]   He said, "These men who say that they are for me, they are not for me.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.260]   They've never sought my counsel.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.260]   They don't know my words.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.260]   And yet they continue to represent me."
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:25.260]   In Jeremiah 23:21, it says, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.260]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied."
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:36.260]   Now, I could pick any one of the prophets in the Old Testament and there is some rebuke.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:42.260]   Whether it's in Isaiah, whether it's in Ezekiel, in the book of Amos.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:47.260]   Almost every single one of these prophets ends up rebuking the leaders of Israel.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:52.260]   But he said, "The spiritual condition of the nation of Israel is because of the leaders of Israel.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.260]   They did not do their job."
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.260]   Why is this so important?
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.260]   Because the same theme continues in the New Testament.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:07.260]   Jesus is rebuking these Pharisees, these lawyers, these scribes.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.260]   Because they stood in the way of God's people coming to them.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:18.260]   And so, in order for the gospel to go, in order for him to come to the cross,
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   he needed to break down the religious system that was built up that led them to the wrong path.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:32.260]   So, as shocking as it is, the whole religious system did not just need a little tweaking.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:38.260]   He needed to pull the rug under the foundation publicly.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.260]   They needed to get out of the way.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:46.260]   They needed to repent in order to build a whole system brand new in Christ.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:54.260]   This text that we're looking at, basically Jesus focuses on the judgment that will come upon the Pharisees and the lawyers.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.260]   There are six woes that are mentioned.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:01.260]   But the whole scene begins with Jesus being invited by the Pharisee.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.260]   In the beginning, it sounds like the Pharisees are very intrigued with Jesus.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.260]   And he invites Jesus to come to his home.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.260]   And when he comes and prepares dinner, he sees that Jesus is not washing his hands.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.260]   And because Jesus is not following their tradition, saying,
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   "Why? How can this be the Messiah if he's not following our tradition, our laws?"
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.260]   And Jesus uses that opportunity, said, "I was waiting."
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.260]   It's almost like Jesus was kind of setting it up and waiting for them to ask this question
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.260]   so that he can turn around and expose their hypocrisy.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.260]   Now, you have to understand that Jesus was not breaking any laws.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   It was the tradition that they set up.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:45.260]   And I want to read to you from the Mishnah, which is the Jewish teachings on washing of hands.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.260]   So I want you to pay attention to what it says.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.260]   See if you can understand what the law was that they were accusing Jesus of.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:39:00.260]   "The hands are susceptible to uncleanness, and they are rendered clean by the pouring over them of water up to the wrist."
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.260]   Okay?
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.260]   Now, up to this point, it's not confusing.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.260]   "Thus if a man had poured the first water up to the wrist and the second water beyond the wrist,
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.260]   and the water flowed back to the hand, the hand becomes clean.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:23.260]   If he poured the second water over the one hand, and his one hand alone is clean.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.260]   If he had poured the water over the one hand and rubbed it on the other, it becomes unclean.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:35.260]   If he rubbed it on his head or on the wall to dry it, it remains clean."
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.260]   Did you understand?
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:42.260]   I had to read this four or five times to even understand what it is exactly they were saying.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.260]   Basically, they're saying, pour the water, and then you go back and forth.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.260]   And if the water goes over the wrist and it cleans the front, then it's clean.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.260]   But if it doesn't come over, it still means unclean.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.260]   If only one happens, the other is clean, but this one remains clean.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.260]   If you touch something to wipe it off, then they both become unclean.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.260]   The only way that it remains clean, if you rub it over the head or something else that's considered clean,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.260]   then they consider both clean.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:13.260]   Now, as ridiculous as that sound, compared to the traditions that they created for obeying the Sabbath,
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.260]   this makes it look very simple.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:22.260]   They had all these truths in the intent, with the intent, that if we follow these rules,
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:29.260]   that if we obey the laws, and we want to make sure that we cover this meticulously,
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   and we're going to apply everything that the Bible says this way,
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   that this is somehow going to bring us closer to God.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   It was this that they were accusing of.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.260]   It was not the word of God.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.260]   Jesus did not disobey anything in the law, or he would not be sinless.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:50.260]   It was the additional laws that they created to make sure that we're going to get this right.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:58.260]   Jesus turns that opportunity and turns it around, and he reveals their hypocrisy.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   After Jesus gives the six rebukes, the three to the Pharisees, three to the lawyers,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.260]   one of the lawyers said to him, it says in verse 45,
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.260]   "Teacher, when you say this, you insult us too."
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.260]   So the lawyers are hearing this in the background.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.260]   Jesus turns around rebuking the Pharisees, and they're like, "Wait a second.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.260]   That sounds like he's rebuking us too."
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.260]   Right?
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.260]   And he said, "Jesus, you know, what you're saying is kind of offensive to us."
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.260]   And he turns around and says, "Well, I'm glad you said that.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   Here's a rebuke for you."
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.260]   Right?
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.260]   And we'll get to that next time.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.260]   And because they get offended, in verse 53 and 54, it says,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.260]   "When he left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.260]   and to question him closely on many subjects,
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:47.260]   plotting against him to catch him in something he might say."
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.260]   We talked about that on Father's Day.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.260]   And the reason why the elders, the leaders, need to be above reproach
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.260]   is because they are taking the light into darkness.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.260]   And the darkness who does not welcome the light
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.260]   is going to turn it around and accuse you.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:05.260]   And so if you have something to stumble you, you will be disqualified.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.260]   And that's exactly what they were trying to do with Jesus.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.260]   Jesus, if he just didn't speak, if he just loved them and fed them
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.260]   and took care of them and healed them, they would have loved Jesus.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.260]   They were going to forcefully make him king.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.260]   But it was because of what he kept on saying.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.260]   He kept on exposing things that they didn't want exposed.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.260]   He's kept on shining light in darkness.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.260]   And as a result of that, they were offended.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.260]   And he said they were deliberately looking.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.260]   If they're not going to repent, if I'm not wrong, you must be wrong.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:41.260]   So they decided to look for a reason to get rid of him.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   So they were looking.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:48.260]   Anything that they can stumble him over, anything that he says, anything that he does.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.260]   Say, "Oh, look, he's not keeping the Sabbath.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.260]   Look at the things that he's saying.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.260]   Look who he's hanging around with.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.260]   He can't be a man of God."
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:04.260]   And the reason why he had to be disqualified is because if he's not disqualified, then they're disqualified.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.260]   So in order to self-preserve themselves, they had to get rid of him.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.260]   That was the reason why they had to get rid of him.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.260]   Jesus gives the three woes.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:25.260]   And before he even enters into the three woes, he gives a summary of the reason why they are in the condition that they are in.
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   In verse 37 through 41.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.260]   Basically, Jesus describes their hypocrisy.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:40.260]   He said, "You clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but inside of you are filled with robbery and wickedness."
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.260]   Again, in Matthew 15:8, it says, "These people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.260]   They focused on the external righteousness.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.260]   Presentation.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:57.260]   Those of you who are at the four spiritual disciplines, we talked about how there are four different areas of our life.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.260]   And you have the "me and others."
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.260]   We have the public life.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   And then you have the private life.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   "Me only."
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.260]   These are areas of our life if we don't confess.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   These are inner things that people may not see.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   Your coveting.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.260]   Your bitterness.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.260]   Your lust.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.260]   If you don't confess your sins, they wouldn't know.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.260]   And then you have others.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.260]   Oh, sorry.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.260]   My knees just buckled.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.260]   If you have, there's an area of your life where it's a blind spot.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:26.260]   Where you may not be fully aware, but other people see it.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   And so when people touch that, you don't want people touching that because it hurts your pride.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.260]   And then you have an area of your life where only God knows.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:41.260]   And so if you focus all your attention on the only your public life, your public presentation, what do you become?
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.260]   What do you become?
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.260]   What do you become?
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.260]   A hypocrite.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.260]   A hypocrite.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:53.260]   And the word hypocrite is understood in our generation equivalent to Pharisee.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.260]   When we say you're a Pharisee, we're saying you are a hypocrite.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   A hypocrite.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:02.260]   In Matthew 23, Jesus gives another eight set of woes to the leaders of Israel.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.260]   And he said, you Pharisees, you are hypocrites.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   You Pharisee, you're a hypocrite.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.260]   Eight separate times he says, you hypocrite.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.260]   You hypocrite.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260]   You hypocrite.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.260]   You hypocrite.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.260]   The word hypocrite literally means actor.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.260]   Actor.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:22.260]   Actor is somebody who is one person off the stage and another person on the stage.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:29.260]   You're so focused on your presentation and your reputation of righteousness.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:34.260]   But inwardly, he says, you are filled with dead men's bones.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.260]   You spent all your time decorating how people view you.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.260]   But inwardly, nothing has changed.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:46.260]   He says, inside you are filled with robbery and wickedness.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   On the outside, you seem like godly men.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.260]   You are the experts of the law.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.260]   You are the ones who are leading the synagogues.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.260]   You are the ones that people run to for counsel on the outside.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.260]   You're the one who are obeying the commandments on the outside.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.260]   But inside, he says, it is filled with robbery and wickedness.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   And we see that same theme over and over again.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.260]   Jeremiah 6:13, it says, for from the least of them, even to the greatest of them,
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.260]   everyone is greedy for gain.
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.260]   And from the prophet, even the priest, everyone deals falsely.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.260]   Now greed can be manifested in two separate ways.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.260]   One is financial.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   Where people are taking advantage of people, their position of authority,
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.260]   and they were becoming wealthy off of the people.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:39.260]   But another way a greed or coveting is manifested is desiring selfishness.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:45.260]   The root cause of this is self-motivated, self-glory.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.260]   And so everything that they are doing is for honor, for their own attention.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.260]   So they're not as concerned about the people.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.260]   They're more concerned about what people say of them.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   And so it affects the way they worship God.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.260]   It affects who they are.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:11.260]   And the chasm between who they are publicly and who they are privately grows larger and larger
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.260]   the longer they stay in this position.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.260]   Worship is not something you do simply because you did the right things.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.260]   Here's what it means to be a good Christian.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.260]   Here are ten things that we need to do.
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.260]   We need to be disciplined.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.260]   We need to have this and all that.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.260]   None of that stuff is wrong.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.260]   But true worship is something that happens from within.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   You can come here year after year, decade after decade, and never truly worship God.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:45.260]   That's why Jesus says what he is looking for are people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:52.260]   Not just truth because we thought it, we checked off all the list of what it means to be a good worshiper.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   But genuine worship happens from the heart.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:01.260]   Jesus himself said what makes you clean is not what you put into the man.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   It says what comes out.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.260]   It's what comes out.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:10.260]   They say you know because I didn't eat this and I didn't go there and I didn't touch this and I washed my hands.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   He said what makes you unclean is what's inside.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:20.260]   That you can spend all your years perfecting the presentation of godliness on the outside.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.260]   But inside nothing has changed.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:29.260]   Greed, hatred, bitterness, slander, all still inside pride.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.260]   Nothing has changed inside.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.260]   It's just the presentation of godliness is getting better and better.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:41.260]   So our inner man and our outer man becomes two completely different people.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.260]   He says do you not know that God made the inside and the outside?
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.260]   As much as God desires righteousness on the outside.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.260]   He said God also form your inside.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.260]   He said give that which is within as charity and all things are clean for you.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:02.260]   Think about the way that you and I got saved.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.260]   We got saved because we were broken.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:12.260]   Almost every testimony that I've heard upon this pulpit and anywhere else.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.260]   Almost every genuine testimony.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.260]   At one point I was doing this.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:22.260]   I was going to church because my parents told me to do that and I was discipled this way and did that.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:28.260]   And I did all of that externally but I never really saw the depth of my sin.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.260]   Exactly like our brother Jeremy shared.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:39.260]   Especially in a culture, post-Christian culture where there's so much of the culture that is embedded into the church.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:44.260]   But people don't meet Christ until they see the depravity of their own sins.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.260]   Of the corruption not simply externally.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.260]   You know I should not do that.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.260]   I should not watch that.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.260]   That's the easier part.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   But if you recognize the corruption of your own heart.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.260]   And you see the bitterness and hatred.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:06.260]   And one of the most difficult things for us to do is to be humble.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.260]   Is to be humble.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.260]   Because everything inside of us is trying to be better.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   Even spiritually.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.260]   Everything inside of us ever since we're young.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.260]   We want to get better.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.260]   We want to study harder.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.260]   We want to be taller.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.260]   We want to be more athletic.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   We want to have a better job.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.260]   We want to have a better retirement.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.260]   We want to raise better children.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:32.260]   Everything that we do is somewhat motivated by us wanting to elevate ourselves.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.260]   So because our natural instinct.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   Our fallen nature.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.260]   Desires to be seen.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.260]   And to move ahead of other people.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   To go opposite of that.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   And empty ourselves.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   It almost seems impossible.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:51.260]   There's nothing that causes us to be more broken than to pay attention to what's going on inside.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:59.260]   So justification happens when we recognize the depravity of our sins.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.260]   And it causes us to come before God just like the tax collector.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   Beating his chest.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   Because he recognizes the distance between him and this holy God.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.260]   And he realizes the need for his mercy.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   The scripture says in Psalm 51, "A broken and contrite heart God does not despise."
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.260]   We're not saved because we are more determined to be righteous.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   We're not saved because we say, "You know what, from now on we're going to be good."
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   We're going to be more disciplined.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.260]   We're going to make more disciples.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.260]   We're going to share the gospel with more people.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   No.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:47.260]   The beginning of our relationship with God is when we are broken and contrite.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   When we feel the emptiness and helplessness of our situation.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.260]   And so we repent and we cry out to God.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:00.260]   What prevented the Pharisees from coming to Christ is because they saw the chasm between
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.260]   them and God and they thought, "If I can obey the law.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.260]   If I can just be disciplined.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.260]   If I just work harder.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.260]   If I can just study harder.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.260]   If I just get into a higher position.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:14.260]   I can be of more influence."
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   And by doing so, all they have done is prevented the others from coming to Christ.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.260]   And that's why Jesus was so angry.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.260]   That's why God was so angry.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:30.260]   Because the whole purpose of the law was to reveal to them the necessity of Christ.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   And watching the distance between them and God.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.260]   Because all throughout the Old Testament, God warned them.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   He warned the sinners, "Do not come to me.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.260]   Or you will die.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:44.260]   Don't touch that or you will die.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.260]   Don't go there or you will die.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.260]   Don't eat that or you will die."
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.260]   It was a holy God warning the nation of Israel.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.260]   Sinners cannot live in the presence of this holy God.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   So they saw this chasm between God.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.260]   And they said, "But I must get to Him.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.260]   Because that's the only place where I can live."
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.260]   So this tension between sinners.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.260]   Knowing that that's the only place I can live.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.260]   And everything in the scripture tells me I can't get to Him.
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.260]   That in the process of going to Him, I will die.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.260]   But if I don't get to Him, I will die.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.260]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.260]   Who will save me from this?
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.260]   So the whole purpose of the law, the whole purpose of the leadership.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.260]   Was to bring them to Christ.
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.260]   To bring them to Christ.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   To cause sinners to have a broken and contrite spirit before God.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.260]   And that is the cross.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:47.260]   The cross is where God's justice and His mercy is in perfect union.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.260]   And that's the first woe that He gives.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.260]   Woe to you Pharisees.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.260]   For you pay tithe and mint and rule and every kind of gardener.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.260]   And yet disregard justice and the love of God.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.260]   But these are the things that you should have done without neglecting the others.
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.260]   They paid attention to the easier part.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.260]   The things that they can do.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:10.260]   They pay their tithes of mint, rule and every gardener.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.260]   But it says when it comes to justice and the love of God.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.260]   You're not aware of it.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.260]   You don't pay attention to it.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:24.260]   You know, I have to stop here and explain what he means by justice of God.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.260]   Because our generation has hijacked this term.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:33.260]   They say, oh yeah, you know, that God really wants us to pay attention to social justice.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:40.260]   And our idea of justice has been hijacked by this world thinking that this is what we're supposed to do to carry out justice.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.260]   The word justice in Greek is chrysis.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.260]   And the word literally means to make judgment in a legal case.
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.260]   It's used 40 separate times in the New Testament alone.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:55:00.260]   And the word, the root word behind this word justice simply means to do righteousness.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.260]   To be righteous.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.260]   It means to be fair.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.260]   It means to do what is right.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:16.260]   So another word to understand this is that you, he says, you are ignoring God's righteousness and his love.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.260]   You're focusing on the external things that you are able to do.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:29.260]   But the things that God really requires of holiness and the love of God, you ignore.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:38.260]   You know, what's really interesting is in 1 Corinthians 16:22, there's this juxtaposition between the love of God and the judgment of God.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.260]   And he says, if anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.260]   I mean, I want you to really think and meditate on that.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.260]   You need to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:54.260]   And if you don't, damn you.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.260]   We have a tendency to either cling to one or the other.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:04.260]   We think, you know, I grew up in a church that was too, too harsh on righteousness.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.260]   So I'm going to balance this out by just clinging to grace.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.260]   Or maybe you grew up in a church and it says, you know what, it's just too much grace, grace, grace.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.260]   And people didn't take their righteousness seriously.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:18.260]   So I'm going to swing over here about discipline and righteousness.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:27.260]   God never, God never does anything where he compromises his justice and his love.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   Everything he does is a perfect union of God's righteousness and his love.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.260]   That's what the cross is.
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:43.260]   If you come to the cross and you come to the other side and you say, thank God for the grace of God.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.260]   That despite my sins, he just forgave me.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.260]   And that causes you to understand cheap grace.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.260]   That you're going to live your life.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.260]   He's like, thank God.
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.260]   Once saved, always saved.
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.260]   It's by faith alone.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.260]   It's not what we do since he did it for us.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.260]   And then you're able to live your life in licentiousness.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.260]   You have not come to the cross.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:09.260]   The cross is necessary in order to satisfy his justice.
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:14.260]   If you take one without the other, the cross doesn't make any sense.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:19.260]   If you want to just emphasize his grace and love, why was he crucified?
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.260]   Just say you're forgiven.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.260]   Just say you're forgiven.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.260]   I won't hold it against you.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.260]   Just say you're forgiven.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:31.260]   The reason why the cross was necessary is because his justice had to be satisfied.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.260]   His righteousness had to be satisfied.
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.260]   Imagine the depth of our sins.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:46.260]   Imagine how sin must look to this perfectly holy God that he created hell and said, sinners deserve this.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.260]   We want to sweep it under the rug because we think that if we don't mention hell,
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:54.260]   more people will be interested in the gospel.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.260]   And they are.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.260]   They are.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.260]   If you minimize his wrath, but you don't understand who God is.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.260]   And you end up nullifying his holiness and his justice.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:10.260]   And that's the reason why people who claim to know God can live perpetually in sin.
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.260]   And cling to a superficial understanding of the gospel.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.260]   One saved, always saved.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.260]   Saved by faith, not by works.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.260]   And therefore, me living in sin, thank God that my sin is covered.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.260]   No.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:32.260]   If you come to the cross, it forces us to look at what was it about my sin that would require the Son of God.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.260]   The Son of God.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.260]   That only he could bear my sins.
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:41.260]   What was it about my sin, the corruption of my own heart?
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:46.260]   That the only remedy was that the wrath of God had to be absorbed by the Son of God.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:56.260]   And in light of that, in light of that, we live to honor God, to worship God.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:06.260]   You cannot come to Christ and somehow nullify or minimize the holiness of God.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.260]   Or you're on the other end.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.260]   You know what?
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.260]   It's just too much grace.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.260]   Too much grace.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.260]   We need to whip people into shape.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.260]   We need to get people disciplined.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.260]   We're going to be more determined than ever.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.260]   We're going to be more organized than ever.
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.260]   And that's what the Pharisees were doing.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:29.260]   And as a result of doing that, they didn't realize how desperate they were.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:34.260]   See, the whole purpose of the law is to recognize the chasm between us and God.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:39.260]   And when Christ came, they realized, "Thank you, Jesus, for coming.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.260]   We've been waiting for you.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   Because you're the only answer to my sin."
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:52.260]   See, those who only focus on the external, they don't realize the depth of their sin.
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.260]   Because the external changes can happen easily.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.260]   Just be disciplined.
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.260]   I mean, you go to the gym because you want a better body.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.260]   I see so many people fasting.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:08.260]   You know, we live in a generation where, I mean, people just don't fast.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   But every time I hear people fasting, it's so that they can be in better shape.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.260]   So, the problem is not fasting.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.260]   It's the motivation behind fasting.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   So, we can be disciplined.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   We can work hard.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.260]   And if we're smart enough, we can organize.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:29.260]   But when you try to kill the pride in you.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   When you try to love people that are difficult to love.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.260]   When you try to forgive somebody.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.260]   When you try to forgive somebody that wronged you or slandered you.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.260]   And you see the corruption of your own heart.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.260]   And you try to be sanctified in that.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.260]   You can't help but to come before God.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.260]   I can't.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.260]   Oh, what a wretched sinner I am.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.260]   But if you focus on, oh, but I pay the rule.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   I pay the mint.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.260]   And I pay tithe for all of these things.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.260]   And why are you doing it?
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.260]   I woke up at six.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.260]   Why are you waking up at eight?
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.260]   I memorized three verses.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.260]   You only memorized one.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.260]   I go out and evangelize.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.260]   But you don't come.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:16.260]   When our righteousness is only on the outside, it easily fills us with pride.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.260]   In comparison.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:25.260]   When we recognize the depth of the corruption of our own heart.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.260]   Of how difficult it is to love sinners.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.260]   That when you're wronged.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.260]   And you feel humbled.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.260]   Because somebody humiliated you.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   They called you something that you didn't want.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.260]   They talked about you a certain way.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.260]   And you try so hard to forgive them.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.260]   And you realize how much of your flesh is still alive.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:53.260]   And that's why Jesus says, if you look at a woman lustfully, you've committed adultery.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.260]   If you say, I hate my brother.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.260]   In your heart, you've committed murder.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.260]   Because he's trying to reveal to us.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   Your corruption is much deeper than you know.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.260]   You are much more desperate than you can possibly realize.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:13.260]   So any kind of pride that you have is because you focused on the external.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.260]   But if you really realize what was inside.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.260]   You will be like the tax collector.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.260]   Beating your chest.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:26.260]   And so the root of worship is sinners recognizing this.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.260]   And that we've been saved from this.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:31.260]   That this chasm that I cannot bridge.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.260]   Christ did for me.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.260]   And so every Sunday we come together to worship God.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.260]   In response to that great gift.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:43.260]   But when our focus is on the external.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   When we did well that week, we come in with pride.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.260]   And then when we didn't do well that week, we come in kind of lowly.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.260]   Because our focus is upon ourselves.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   This is why Jesus was so angry.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.260]   This is why Jesus was so angry with the Pharisees.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.260]   Because he was leading them astray.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:08.260]   In John 5:39-40 he says, "You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   It is that these that testify about me.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:16.260]   You are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life."
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.260]   The primary duty of the leaders was to bring them to God.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.260]   Not to themselves.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:27.260]   The primary work of the church is to bring them to Christ.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.260]   Not to fill the church.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:34.260]   You can come to church week after week after week after week and never meet Christ.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.260]   If we are focused on the external.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.260]   Because externally you have done it.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.260]   You came to church.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.260]   You came to Bible study.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260]   You gave.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.260]   So you did all of that.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:49.260]   But when we recognize the corruption of our own heart, it forces us to come before God.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.260]   Because I can't do this by my own strength.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:58.260]   That's why Christ says in John 10:11, "I am the good shepherd."
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:04.260]   And when he's saying that, he's basically rebuking the leaders.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.260]   You guys are dependent on leaders thinking that they're going to show you the way.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.260]   And if you don't obey them, they kicked you out of the synagogue.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.260]   He says, "I am the good leader."
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   Everyone else comes.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.260]   When the wolves come and danger comes, they're going to run away.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.260]   They're not here for you, but the good shepherd lays down his life for you.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.260]   I am the good shepherd.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.260]   He says, "I am the bread."
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:35.260]   You want a leader because you think if you follow the right leader that they're going to provide for your life.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260]   He says, "I am the bread."
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:41.260]   You think if the Messiah comes as he's going to turn on the light and he's going to show you the way.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.260]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:46.260]   You think if you have the leaders and if you just follow the right people,
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.260]   that somehow you're going to find the way, the truth and the life.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.260]   Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.260]   Nobody comes to the Father but through me.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:59.260]   You see why Jesus was so angry with these leaders?
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:05.260]   His anger told their leaders it's because he loves us.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:11.260]   He was angry because he was leading the apple of his eye to worship false gods.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:22.260]   To give them self confidence as peace, peace when there is no peace.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:28.260]   He was angry with the Pharisees because they looked at the chasm and the whole point of the chasm was to wait and to beg for the mercy of God to come.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.260]   Instead they said, "Let me show you."
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:46.260]   If you obey the law this way, if you kept the Sabbath this way, if you read the Bible this way, if you had the right thinking, if you had the right application, and by teaching them that, they prevented the way to Christ.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:53.260]   Because the whole point of everything Christ has done is to break us from our pride so that we would be broken.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.260]   That we would have contrite spirit.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:02.260]   The greatest deterrence to coming to Christ is our own pride.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.260]   Is our own pride.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:11.260]   And so God has to do away with our pride in order for the gospel to make any sense.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.260]   That we may live lives worthy of the gospel that he has given us.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:20.260]   You know, I have two other points but I'm done.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:26.260]   I couldn't finish the first service so I'm not going to finish the second service either.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   But the point is clear.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   The point is clear.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:44.260]   The reason why he was so angry with the leaders is because sometimes our own righteousness prevents us from coming to Christ.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:49.260]   And let me explain that so somebody takes that word and then take it to the court of law.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   Look what he said.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.260]   Don't be righteous.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.260]   Let me phrase it another way so that you don't misquote me.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:04.260]   It is our self-righteousness that sometimes is the biggest hindrance to coming to Christ.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:15.260]   That's why when we come to Christ, almost every testimony begins by saying, I didn't realize how sinful I was.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:20.260]   I didn't realize how far I was from God.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.260]   I didn't realize how helpless I was.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:28.260]   I didn't realize that nothing I did, I could bridge that gap.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.260]   So I begged for his mercy.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.260]   So I begged for his mercy.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.260]   So I asked for forgiveness.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.260]   And he forgave me.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.260]   That's salvation.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.260]   That's salvation.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.260]   Let's pray.
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:56.260]   Father, we thank you so much.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:11.260]   that despite our wanderings, despite our pride, while we were yet sinners, while we were blasphemy, that you chose to love us.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:21.260]   Thank you, Father, for satisfying your wrath that we deserve, that our Savior Jesus Christ absorbed on himself.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   Help us, Lord God, to have greater and deepening understanding of what it is that we already have in Christ.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.260]   That our response simply would be reasonable.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:40.260]   that we would reflect this righteousness, this love and mercy in every aspect of our lives.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.260]   May Christ be exalted.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.260]   Christ and Christ alone be exalted.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:52.260]   That more and more people may come to know that desperate people know Christ.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.260]   Desperate people need Christ.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:09:00.260]   Help us to realize what we have, that we may worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.260]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.

[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
