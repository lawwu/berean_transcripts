[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   "and perseverance, proven character,

[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   FAM 245 Ministry, if you are married three years or less,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   there is a workshop that's happening on January 20th
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   at 10.30 a.m. in the Sprouts Room,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   so mark that on your calendar.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   Bible Lab, as we are taking a break
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   for our normal Bible study, there's a Bible Lab
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   to help you to better prepare for Bible study,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   inductive Bible study.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   Pastor Mark is gonna be leading that.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   On Sundays from 2.30 to 3.30, one hour, three session,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   starting from January 21st, 28th, and the 4th.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   Again, at 2.30, so this would be after lunch,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   and then you'll be back on campus at 2.30 to 3.30.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   This will help you quite a bit to be able to,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   if you're having a hard time doing inductive Bible study,
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   this will kind of get you jump-started
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   to help you with that, okay?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   Again, just a few more announcements.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   One, the Jubilee Ministry, if you're 50 and older,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   there is a new Bible reading plan,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   a fellowship that's gonna be happening,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   and it'd be an opportunity to get together
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   with the other Jubilee members, again,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   if you're 50 and over, to go through the Bible together.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   I think it's the New Testament
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   that they're gonna be going through,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   so please contact Elder Phillip,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   and he'll be able to sign you,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   and then I think there's fellowship
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.640]   that's going on along with that.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   And along with that, we have a new ministry
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   called Fig Ministry, Families in God Ministry.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   So if you're not FAM245, if you're not fairly newlyweds,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   or if you're not veterans, 50 and over,
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   there's a big chunk of ministry that's in between.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   There's a new ministry that's gonna be starting,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   and we're gonna be having a presentation
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   from our brother Dean next Sunday
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   to explain a little bit more during the members' meeting.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   But they will also be having a Bible reading plan
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   that's gonna be coinciding with the Jubilee.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   So if you want to sign up for that
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   and to read through the Bible together,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   you can please sign up for that.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   I think there's a website sign-up, right?
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   Where do they sign up, on the website?
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   Okay, so go to the website,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   or after next members' meeting,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   there'll be sign-ups that you can take place after that.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   Okay, I think that's it.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   And one other thing is that Galatians Bible study
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   is gonna be continuing in February,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   so we have the whole month of January off.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   Our India team is going to be leaving on January 26th,
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   and then when we get back,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   the Bible study's gonna begin, okay?
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.640]   So if you haven't signed up for home group or small group,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   please sign up as soon as possible
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   so that we can better prepare for that, all right?
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   Let me pray for us.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.640]   And again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   there's an offering box in the back.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   Otherwise, we'll be giving online.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   And afterwards, our brother CJ
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   is going to be coming up giving his testimony,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   and he will be baptized this morning, all right?
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   Let's pray.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   Father, we thank you, Father,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   for this new day, Lord God,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   that we have to celebrate and to prepare for 2024.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   We pray, Lord, that you give us a heart of surrender,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   Lord, that we may worship you truly in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   Focus our eyes and attention, Lord God, upon you,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   that we would desire to know you, to love you,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   to worship you more passionately than we've ever in 2024.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   Teach us, Lord God, to be a church to pray,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.640]   to pray earnestly, Lord God,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   that we may receive your power
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   and that through us you will do mighty things.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   We pray that in our giving,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   that you would multiply it, Lord God,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   multiply the joy, multiply, Lord God, the use of it.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   May it be used, Lord, effectively, wisely,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   - Hello, my name is CJ, and I'm part of the youth group.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   And this is my testimony.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   I grew up in a loving Christian home
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   where I was blessed with parents
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   who took us regularly to church.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   To me, church was a routine where I would go
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   and have one day of the week to worship and learn about God.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   I had no true knowledge of Jesus and the gospel
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   and didn't understand the meaning and weight
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   of the sacrifice Jesus had made.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   I would memorize verses, but not to treasure God's word,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   but to make my parents proud and to avoid punishment.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   I would go to a one and offer another opportunity
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   to be worshiping God or for fun games
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   and for hanging out with friends.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   During the week, I was a disobedient kid
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   and lied habitually to cover my own tracks.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   When I would get caught, instead of feeling sorry,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   I would plan on how I could commit the sin again
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   without getting caught again.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   For a long while, I was content with this bland,
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   sinful routine and was satisfied with this cycle of sin
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   until I began high school.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   I would grow tired of being expected to memorize verses
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   and to read the Bible.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   Worship had no true meaning to me,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   and I wanted to stop going to church
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   so I could live my own life.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   By the grace of God, I entered adolescence
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   and started to attend the Vine Youth Group.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   There, I finally began to hear the Bible
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   and take the word more seriously.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   I would be more inclined to pay attention
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   to the sermons of the pastors and heed warnings of sins.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   I tried to repent of my sins with sincerity and sorrow,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   but even with my having a better understanding
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.640]   of spiritual matters,
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   my sinfulness began to accelerate at a shocking speed.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   I would indulge in lustful passions,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   lie on a regular basis, and always be angry and violent.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   I didn't truly understand what it meant to be saved
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   and have a relationship with God,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   and I lived a double life.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   On July 24, 2023, I finally came to Christ.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   Before that day, I was sneaking to play video games
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   and wanting to have some entertainment
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   before I went to sleep.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   I constantly pushed for the things that I desired,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   even if it meant I had to lie, cheat, or steal.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   If it weren't for screen time or limits on the device,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   I would not have gotten caught.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   But my dad caught me and told me
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.640]   that we would talk the next day.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   I went to sleep without feeling any sort of remorse for my sin
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.640]   and went to sleep wondering how I would get out of the punishment.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   The following day, I was ready to get it over with
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   and the lecture and the punishment over with.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   My dad started to lecture me and my brother
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   and spoke with us for a very long time.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   That was when he began to lead the conversation to the gospel.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   My dad began to break down emotionally,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   pleading with us to truly understand
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   why Jesus had to die for a sinful man.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   It was then at that moment that a terrifying realization hit me.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   My dad does not get emotional that easily.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   This made me realize that this was truly serious
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   and that sin in my life would destroy me.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   That's when I sat there on the couch and began to pray.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   During this time, many things fled in my mind
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   and the weight of my sins overwhelmed me.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   I thought of the times where I attempted to repent
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   but was only in vain.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   I thought of the times where I would only think about myself
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   and my selfish desires.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.640]   I thought of my friends who had recently given their lives to Christ
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   and what that truly meant for me.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   I realized that the gospel was my faith
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   and that all I had to do was grasp the invitation
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   into the family of God.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   I prayed for a while before finally making the decision
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   to come to Christ and accept Him as my Savior.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   I asked my parents to pray with me
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   while I repented and surrendered my life to Christ.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   After being convinced that I was truly saved,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   I felt an intense joy.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   I felt at peace for the first time in a long time.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   It was that feeling that I remember to this very day,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   and I am thankful to God for it.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   That day, I meditated on a specific chapter
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   that my parents told me to read.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   That chapter was Ephesians 2,
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   and a verse that really stood out to me was verses 8 through 9.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   and that not of yourself, it is the gift of God,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   I did nothing to contribute to my conversion.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.640]   God yanked me out of the water where I was drowning,
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   and by mercy, Jesus created a way
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   so I can escape the eternal punishment that was for me.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   By His grace, I am able to say that I am a child of God,
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   and I will walk with Him until being called
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   into His presence forever.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   I know that I will struggle with the weight of wanting to sin,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   but because of Jesus, I can confidently say
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   that He will be with me every step of the way.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   Thank you.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   [applause]
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   If you understand, when you're going into the water,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   you're being united with Christ's death.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   Then when you come back out,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   you're being united with resurrected life.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.640]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   [applause]
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   Obviously, this is a very special day.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   For the Jun family, I know that they've been praying for CJ
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   and their children's salvation for so many years,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   and also watching him grow up since he was a baby.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   He was born six months before my son,
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   and I remember my earliest memory of CJ was
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   we were at Best Western summer retreat,
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.640]   and so I was watching the kids.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   I think they were right around one years old.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   They weren't able to stand yet,
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   but I remember looking at both of them saying, "Don't touch this."
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   For whatever it was, I was in the room by myself.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   I said, "Don't touch this."
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   I remember CJ looking straight in my eyes and just moving his arm.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   [laughter]
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   He was looking straight at me,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   and then he kind of like skirted it just to see.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   I said, "No, CJ!"
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   Anyway, that's my earliest memory of him.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.640]   Then seeing him give his testimony this morning is just so real.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   [laughter]
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   Overjoyed for him, for the family, for our church
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640]   to be able to see our children grow up,
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   and all the people who invested in his life as well at church,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   so many teachers who throughout the years,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   whether it was Sunday school or VBS or even a youth group,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   and just sitting there and counseling him
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   and coming alongside with the parents
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   to be able to share the gospel with him.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   That's ultimately our desire.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   What we see with CJ is that every single one of our children
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   is in a church that really values the gospel,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   and that this is not just something that we just talk about
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   and have a form of godliness,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   but that our next generation of children
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   who are being raised in this home,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   some of them maybe babies now,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   that hopefully when they are our age,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   that they'll be able to take the baton
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   and really be able to be a greater light for the next generation.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   Again, seeing CJ get baptized just, again,
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   gives greater hope for me and for all of us
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   for our next generation.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians 6,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   I'm just going to be reading one verse.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   I'm going to be in this text,
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   the very familiar text that's in verse 10
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   all the way down for the next three weeks.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   As we transition to the new year in 2024,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   as you can see, our banner has changed,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   at least on one side, right?
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   We've been focusing on this probably the last five or more years.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   It's pray and something else, pray and proclaim,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   pray and be sober, pray and be watchful.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   As we're wrestling with this,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   it's like do we want to have this theme again
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   or is there something else?
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   The reason why I decided to choose this
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   because I can't think of anything else
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   that really stands out to me that really requires
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   and that we need to improve on than this.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   Even if for the rest of my tenure at this church
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   that this is something that we're going to be focusing on,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   until our church actually has a reputation
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   of being a prayer church,
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.640]   I believe that this is something we need to focus on.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   We need to continue to grow, including myself.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.640]   This is a reminder to us that as we go this year
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   that we want to improve.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   If we improve and our church continues to grow
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   and Bible studies and all these things are growing,
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   but we have not moved in the depth of our prayer
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   and our devotion to prayer,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   I would not consider that a success.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   I think this is something that we really need to work on
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   and that's why we're emphasizing this again in this text.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   I'm going to read verse 18 and we'll jump in this morning.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   "With all prayer and petition,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   "pray at all times in the Spirit,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   "and with this in view, be on the alert
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   "with all perseverance and petition for all the saints."
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your direction,
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   your guidance, and your understanding, Lord God.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   We pray for your mercy.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   We pray for your grace.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   May your word and your word only go forth.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   So the theme of this year is pray in the Spirit.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   But what does praying in the Spirit mean?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   Now, if you're from a charismatic background,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   you may have heard that maybe praying in the Spirit
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   is some mystical thing that you need to be touched
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   or maybe you need to be praying in tongues
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   and that's what it means to be praying in the Spirit.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   But that term praying in the Spirit is not unique to this text.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   In fact, all over Scripture we are reminded
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   that everything that we do is to be done in the Spirit.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   That you can study the Bible, you can walk,
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   you can do evangelism, do all this stuff,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   but at the core of it, when Jesus says,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me,"
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   he says abide in me in John chapter 15
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   after he reminds them in chapter 13 and 14
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   that the Holy Spirit, the Helper, is going to come,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   that he's not going to leave them as orphans.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   So when he says to abide,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   he is referring them to the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   That you cannot bear fruit unless you are abiding in the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   You need to continue in the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   So in Galatians 5.16 we are told to walk in the Spirit.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   In Romans 8.13 he says,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   "The identifying mark of a child of God
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   is one who is being led by the Spirit."
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   Philippians 3.3, he said,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   "We are to worship in the Spirit."
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   1 Corinthians 14.16,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   "When we bless one another, we are to bless in the Spirit."
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   In Galatians 6.1, if somebody falls into sin
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   that we are trying to restore them,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.640]   he says we are to restore them in the Spirit.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   And then he says in Romans 8.26,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   "The Holy Spirit, when it prays,
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   it groans on our behalf."
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   It groans on our behalf
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   that we may be able to have effective prayer.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   So you cannot do anything as a Christian
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   if you're not in the Spirit.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   Or else it becomes just a religious activity.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   Everything that we do in the church,
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   if we are doing it by our own strength,
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.640]   is no different than a Buddhist going to a temple
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   and lighting up some incense
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   and hoping that the powers
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   are going to answer your prayers for your purpose.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   So it's nothing more than a religious activity
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   unless it is in the Spirit.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   That's the identifying mark
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   of a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   So in the church, you may have people who are filled,
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   who grew up in the church and out of habit or superstition,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   are doing things because they want blessing from God
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   so that they can live a better life.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   It's just that the avenue that we have chosen
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   to get blessing for a better life is Jesus.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   For Buddhists, it may be Buddha, right?
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   For anybody else, whatever God that they choose,
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   it's just that that's just the avenue
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   that they had access to
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   so that they can have a better life.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   The distinguishing mark of a Christian is the Spirit.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   The Spirit of God dwells in us,
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   and the Spirit of God leads us.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   The Spirit of God causes us to walk with Him,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   and it is the Spirit of God that teaches us to pray.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   And so, not only do we need to pray,
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   just do it.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   Just get it done.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.640]   He says, "No, to pray at all times in the Spirit."
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   Now, in order to understand
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   what does it mean to pray in the Spirit,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   again, everything needs to be understood
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   in the context of the text.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   If we want to understand what Paul means
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   by praying in the Spirit,
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.640]   we need to understand what he's been saying prior.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   So if you know, we've studied the book of Ephesians
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   several times in our church history,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   and if you know the book of Ephesians,
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   it's divided into two major parts.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   First three chapters is doctrine.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   It tells us about Christ, His love,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   election, predestination,
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   how we've become adopted as children of God.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   And then chapter 4 through 6,
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   he says, "Therefore, live up to the gospel
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   that you've been given."
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   That we need to be united.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   What does it mean to be a good father,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.640]   to be a young man?
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.640]   And so it gives us imperatives
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   based upon the doctrines
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   that we know about Christ, the gospel.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   And then the conclusion of everything that he says
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   is in this text in chapter 6.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   That after you've learned all the doctrines
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   and you know, like, this is how you ought to live,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   he concludes this section by saying,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   "Pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   Now, you know that anything in the Bible
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   that is said in repetition,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   you know that we're supposed to pay
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   more close attention.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   Like today, if we wanted to emphasize something,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   you might highlight it, bold it,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   you know, you might put circles around it,
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   whatever it is, so that whoever comes to that text,
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   you know you need to pay attention to this.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   Apostle Paul, in verse 18,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   isn't by accident that he mentions
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   petitioning and praying four separate times
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   for all things, for all occasions.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   So we can say that everything that he has said
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   in six chapters concludes his main point
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   by saying, "Pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   So I can't overemphasize enough
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   why this is so important,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   why our church needs to continue to grow
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   in this aspect.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   We need to pray.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   But in praying, if our prayers are going to be effective,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   it needs to be praying in the Spirit, right?
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   So what is, again, in the context of that,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   what does praying in the Spirit mean?
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   Well, if you look at verse 10 through 12,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   it tells us that we need to pray in the Spirit
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   because we are in spiritual warfare.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   "and in the strength of His might.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   "Put on the full armor of God
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   "so that you may be able to stand firm
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   "against the schemes of the devil.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   "but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   "against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   "against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   "in heavenly places."
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   In other words, praying in the Spirit means
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   that we are engaged in a spiritual battle, right?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   First and foremost.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   So before we pray that our finance is good
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   or even for our health,
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   before we pray that we may have
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   a better and comfortable and more peaceful life,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   first and foremost, praying in the Spirit
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   is engaging in the battle
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   that the Spirit of God is engaged in.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   That's what He means by that.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   So here, when He says praying in the Spirit,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   it's not necessarily just something mystical
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   or praying in tongues,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   but that we are praying according to
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.640]   what the Spirit Himself is engaged in,
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   recognizing that we are engaged in spiritual battle.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   There are a couple things that we need to understand
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.640]   about praying in the Spirit, right?
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   1 Peter 3, 7, where we are encouraged to pray,
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   He says, "You husbands, in the same way,
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   "live with your wives in an understanding way
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   "as with someone weaker, since she is a woman,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   "and show her honor as a fellow heir
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   "of the grace of life,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   "so that your prayers will not be hindered."
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   I want you to notice here,
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   He doesn't say, He doesn't say pray
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   so that you can be a better husband, right?
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   That's not what it says.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   He said be a better husband
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   so that you can pray, right?
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   So the purpose of righteous living
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   is so that we can have better, effective prayer.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   So the point of righteousness is prayer.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   Prayer is not what makes us righteous.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   Righteousness is what causes us
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   to be effective prayer warriors.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   Again, in 1 Peter 4, 7,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   "The end of all things is near,
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   "therefore be sound judgment and sober spirit
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   "for the purpose of prayer."
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   You notice here, He doesn't say pray
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   so that you can be sober, right?
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   He says, no, be sober so that you can pray.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.640]   So the emphasis here,
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   the actual work here is not soberness.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   The actual work here is not being a good husband.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   The actual work here is praying.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   Now you can understand,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   if the work is flesh and blood,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   that what we do in the flesh and blood
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   is gonna matter.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   So we pray so that we can be more effective
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   in flesh and blood.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   But that's not what He says.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   He said our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   It's not against flesh and blood.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   So you being better equipped to do physical things
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   is not the point.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   He said doing physical things
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   is so that you may prepare yourself
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   for the actual warfare which is happening in prayer.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   That's what He's saying.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   Prayer is the battle.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   Discipleship is so that we can be better prayer warriors.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   So if discipleship leads to less prayer
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   or not enough prayer,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   then you've missed the whole point of discipleship.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   If Bible study, all it does is causes you
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   to understand the Bible better,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   but it hasn't caused you to pray more effectively,
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   then you've missed the whole point of Bible study.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   Because the whole purpose of Bible study
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   in every spiritual activity
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   is to bring us closer to God.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   And it brings us closer to God
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   when we are able to pray.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   And we are able to experience spiritual power,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   He says, when we pray.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.640]   So He says our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   meaning He's not telling us
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   to be stronger in flesh and blood.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   That's the point that He's making, right?
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   There's not a battle that you can win
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   by working harder or being more disciplined or smarter
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   or having more methods.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   That's His first point, I'm not saying that.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   But He says our battle is against rulers,
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   against powers, against world forces of this darkness,
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   in heavenly places.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   All to say, right,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   if you were to conclude why He says this,
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   that we can get in there
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   and we'll talk about like breastplate of righteousness,
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   the helmet of salvation and the shoes
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   and girding your loins and all of that stuff, right?
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.640]   But the end of it, what is the point?
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   Why is He saying all of these things?
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   He's saying all of these things
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   because He said this is beyond you.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   Your fight isn't you.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   The success of the fight isn't gonna be your discipline,
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   your knowledge, your work.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   It's not flesh and blood.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   How are a bunch of fishermen gonna go against the rulers
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   by their own power?
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   Did Jesus really equip them?
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   And they're so well-trained
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   that when their whole Jewish community want to kill them,
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   that they've been properly trained to know,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   you know, when they go right, go pivot to the left, right?
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   If you see them ahead and hiding,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   and were they properly trained
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   so that they can maneuver away from that?
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   And when you preach the gospel,
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   don't stand too high, stand low.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.640]   And then when a crowd comes,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   make sure you know, you maneuver.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   Were they all trained?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   Is that what Jesus was doing?
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   For the three years that He was walking around
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   with His disciples,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   He said, "When you go there, they're gonna try to kill you,
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   "so I'm gonna better equip you
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.640]   "to take the gospel into hostile areas."
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   When the Roman soldiers come with swords
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   and legions come to kill Apostle Paul,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   that because you're properly trained,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   that they gave you the tools to be able to maneuver
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   and get the gospel out to the remotest part of the world
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   because of your proper discipline and training and method?
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   No, Jesus didn't train them any of that.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   All He said was, "Abide in Me.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   "Don't worry.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   "When they take you into court
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   "and these rulers who killed Me
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   "are threatening you to do the same thing
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   "and you don't know what to say,
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   "don't worry, the Holy Spirit
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.640]   "is gonna give you the words."
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   And that's why He says, "Abide, abide, abide."
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   What are a bunch of farmers gonna do against rulers?
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   What are a bunch of commoners gonna do against powers?
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   How will you fight wickedness in heavenly places?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   We look at it and say, "Well, these politicians are evil,
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   "so if we remove them from power, yeah,
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   "flesh and blood, you can remove the flesh and blood.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   "What are you gonna do about the wickedness
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.640]   "that is controlling these people?
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   "How are you gonna remove those powers?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   "How are you gonna conquer those powers?"
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   So the point of all of this
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   is to remind the readers of the Ephesians,
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   you are completely powerless by yourself.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   People who pray are the people who feel helpless.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   You know, even in your own life,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   when do you pray the most fervently?
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   It's when you're in a situation
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   where you feel utterly helpless.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   Maybe a life is on the line,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   maybe somebody you love is on deathbed
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   and all the doctors help, it's just not working,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   and they said, "Please pray."
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.640]   Even non-Christians pray when they feel helpless.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   Some of you guys who are a little bit older,
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   remember after 9/11,
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   we're all shocked 'cause we've never seen this,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   not on American soil, right?
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   Not since 1940s, we've never seen this.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   So all of a sudden, we all just got shocked.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   This can happen, we can actually go to war.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   And for the first time, I've never seen this before
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   and I've never seen this since.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   The Democrats and the Republicans stood at Capitol Hill,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   arm in arm, and they had a prayer vigil.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   That was such a strange scene
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   because I don't think any of them were Christians.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   Maybe there was a Christian in there, I don't know.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   But the Democrats and Republicans
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   who hated each other before and hated each other after
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   got together and prayed.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   And I don't know which God they prayed to,
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   but they were desperate because they felt helpless
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   and they were scared.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   Now, for non-Christians, they pray when they feel helpless,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   but as soon as the emergency is over,
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   they go right back into their old life,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   living in blasphemy and rebellion against God.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   But the point of everything that Paul says here in this text
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.640]   is to remind us of how helpless we are in this spiritual battle.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   There's nothing that you and I can do
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   that's going to withstand the scheme of the devil.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   That's how he described it, scheming.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   The devil is not just simply coming to us.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   He's scheming.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   He's working behind the scenes.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   So when you are deceived, you don't know.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   You don't know.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   Some of us maybe think like, "Well, we're smart enough
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   "and we study the Bible enough, so we're aware enough,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   "and I'm a good analyst,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   "and I do analysts for a Fortune 500 company,
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   "so I can know.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.640]   "I'm good at reading people."
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   I don't know how smart you are,
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   but you're not smarter than the devil.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   I don't know what you got in your SAT,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   but I'm pretty sure his SAT score is much better than yours.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   I don't know what you got in your GPA.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   I don't know what school you came out of.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   I guarantee the devil is smarter than you.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   How are you, how am I going to withstand
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   the scheme of the devil by our own strength,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   by our own intellect?
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   That's the point he's trying to make.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   I don't care how powerful you are.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   I don't care how committed you are.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   I don't care how determined you are.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   How are you going to overpower evil forces?
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   So the point that he's trying to make,
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   that because this is a spiritual battle,
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   unless you engage in prayer, you will be ineffective.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   You're trying to conquer an army with swords.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   It's not going to work.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   You're going to fail.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   In fact, in Matthew 9, 36-38,
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   Jesus is so moved because he sees the multitudes,
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   the very people that he came to sacrifice his life for.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   It says, "He felt compassion for them
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   "because they were distressed and dispirited,
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   "like sheep without shepherd.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   "Then he said to the disciples,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   "'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.'"
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   Let's stop right there, right?
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   Jesus looks at the people, and he has compassion.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   The whole reason why he came to earth,
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   he took on human flesh and was humiliated as a man
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   is because he had compassion for us.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   Now he is face-to-face with the multitude,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   and he says, "The harvest is plentiful.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   "They're like sheep without shepherd.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   If we stop there, we would assume that we would think,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   okay, if that's the problem, what should we do?
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   We need to look for better shepherds.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   First thing we need to do is we need to form a committee,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   a search committee who's going to get together,
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   and then we've got to find out what kind of pay
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.640]   are we going to offer them, how are we going to attract
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   good shepherds if we don't have the right pay
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   and right resources to support.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   We need to find the right people who are going to be
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   in the search committee so that they can make wise decisions,
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   that they're doctrinally sound,
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   that they're going to be able to choose people
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   who's going to have leadership.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   Are they going to be able to discern?
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   Do they have character issues?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   So we would go through all of that and assess,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   find the right person, place them, and then evaluate,
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   and then hopefully we'll find enough people
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   to be able to meet those needs.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   That's the way that you and I would approach it
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   in our generation with our resources.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   Jesus says, "Therefore, because of this problem,"
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   what does he say?
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   "Beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   to the harvest."
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   Because there is a big problem,
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   because he has compassion on them,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.640]   because the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few,
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   the first thing that he says--
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   in fact, the only thing that he says here--
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   is to pray.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   Pray.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   What problem are you wrestling with now
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   that you are trying to fix, assess?
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   What is the problem?
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   You know, I've been so dry spiritually and so lost.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   You know, I'm looking for counseling.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Maybe a book if I read it.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   Maybe if I had an older sister or brother,
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   or maybe if our ministry had this kind of resources
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   and did all of that, and if we had a committee,
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.640]   and you're looking for all these solutions,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   and yet you're not praying.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   The first and the most important thing
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   that any Christian needs to engage in is prayer.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   So before we look for solutions,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   before we complain,
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   before we're griping,
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   are we praying?
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   Maybe, maybe before God satisfies your longing,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   He's waiting for you to come to Him,
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   to pray.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.640]   To pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   To pray in the Spirit, to engage in the Spirit,
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   to beseech the Lord of the harvest.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   So my general rule for my life--
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.640]   don't complain unless I am confident
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.640]   that I have prayed enough.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   Because if I haven't prayed enough,
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   that may be the reason why I feel the way I feel.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   That may be the reason why we're not bearing fruit.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   That may be the reason why certain things aren't going on.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.640]   Until I pray.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   First and foremost.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   If you didn't pray, don't look for human solutions.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   If you didn't engage in prayer,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   don't think you have the answers, because you don't.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.640]   Because you're not able to see things from the Spirit's eyes.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   Until you pray.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   Pride, ultimately, is the biggest reason
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.640]   why we are ineffective.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   Pride.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   Some of you guys know that during my sabbatical that I took,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   I went and got a motorcycle license.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   Some of you guys know, some of you guys don't know.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   Esther gave me permission.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   She said, "If you had the opportunity to do whatever you want,
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   "if you weren't worried about what other people think,
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   "what would you do?"
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   I said, "Motorcycle."
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   That was my dream since I was 15.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   A friend that I knew was selling his motorcycle for a cheap price,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   and I got it.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   I was thinking I was going to live out my dream for three months.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   Then after I'm done, I'm going to fix the bike,
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.640]   and I'm going to resell it, so it's not going to cost me any money.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   My wife was crazy.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   I think she was more crazy than I was, because she was pushing me to get it.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   So I got it.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   I remember taking the motorcycle class, and they would tell me
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   that 95% of all motorcycle accidents happen in the first year.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   Obviously, that freaked me out.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   For the first year, every time I went somewhere--
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   Of course, I never rode to church, only during the weekdays,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   so only the pastors have seen me on this bike,
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   and one other person.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   I would write it, because he told me that 95% of all accidents
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   happen in the first year, and I'm in the beginning of the first year.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   Everywhere I went, I was so cautious.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   You know how the yellow light may be coming on?
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   If you're in a car, you kind of speed up to get.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   I see that two blocks away, and I'm already braking.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   But when it was dangerous was not the beginning.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   When it was dangerous was at the end of that year,
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   I started getting a bit more confident.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   After going 30 miles per hour in the beginning,
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   oh my gosh, you fall off and you die.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   After a while, you go 40, it doesn't feel as bad.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   After you got 60, and then I said, "I'm going to get on the freeway,"
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   and it's like scared to death, and then after a while,
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   you get even comfortable going 60, 70.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   When it got really dangerous was at the end, the tail end of that,
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   I saw a yellow light coming, and I said, "I can pass this."
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   Instead of braking, I started speeding up until I got right there,
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   and I saw all the cars, and that freaked me out,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   and then so I decided to step on my brake.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   It's not like a car where you can step on the brake and it just kind of stops.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   If you brake like that on a motorcycle, you're sliding.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   Again, in my confidence, I started going, and I realized I didn't have time,
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   and I stepped on the brake, and the bike just went out under me.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   I didn't fall.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   By the grace of God, it was starting to skid,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   and I said, "Oh, shoot. I'm going to get in an accident,"
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   and that would have slid me into the middle of the intersection if that happened,
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   but as that was happening, I kind of twisted, and I was shaking back and forth,
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   and I was able to get my equilibrium, and I did skid into the middle of the road,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   and I sheepishly, in humility, walked my bike back
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   with all the drivers looking at me like, "This fool."
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   Good thing I had my helmet on so nobody saw me.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   But I remember after that, I was like, "Wow."
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   I almost got in an accident because I started getting confident.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   I know how to ride this bike. I'm a veteran now.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   I'm not going to be one of those 95% because I've almost made it out of the first year,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   but I realized when I was the most dangerous is when I started getting confident.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   Instead of taking precautions and knowing the danger of riding this bike
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   is when I started feeling safe.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:19.640]   The point that Paul was trying to make is that in your flesh, you are not safe.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   There is an enemy prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour,
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   and in the middle of that, you feel at peace.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   You feel confident that what you're doing is okay.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   You're fighting, and you're smart, and you have experience, and you know what you're doing.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   That's when you are in trouble.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   When he thinks he stands in the flesh, that is when he is the weakest.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   That's why he's reminding the readers.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   After all of this, he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   In Revelation 3.1, it says to the angel of the church in Sardis,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   "He who has seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this,
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   'I know your deeds, that you have the name that you are alive, but you are dead.'"
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.640]   You have a reputation of being alive.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   Everybody sees you and says, "Wow, you're such a spiritual person.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.640]   You know the Bible. You disciple so many people."
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   And so you have a reputation of being alive, but yet the assessment of God is that you're dead.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   It's not somebody who's getting--or a reputation of getting an A.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   It's like, "No, you're not an A student. You're an A-minus student."
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   Or, "You're a B student." Or, "Maybe you're a C student."
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:35.640]   He says, "No. Everybody thinks you're alive, but in God's eyes, you're dead."
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   You have a form of godliness, yet no power.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   Everything you know about God is a theory.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   So every testimony that you have is someone else's.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   You're regurgitating something that you read or a sermon that you heard or illustration.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.640]   But it's not you.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   You've never encountered God.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   So you are regurgitating information.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   You're passing on things that you've learned.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   But it's not you.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   That's why he says to pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.640]   In James chapter 4, too, it says, "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   So when we ask ourselves, "Why do we not pray?"
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   Knowing that we have direct access to God.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   If I told you Bill Gates was in town, is he outdated?
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   He's probably outdated, right?
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   Mark Zuckerberg? Somebody rich, right?
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   If I told you he was in town, and he said to come and ask,
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   how many of you would hesitate to run to him?
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   Oh, we get to ask? And he said, "Whatever. Whatever you ask."
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   We have access to God, and we don't go.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   We have access to God who created the universe.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   He makes Zuckerberg look like he's in poverty.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   And yet we don't go. So why don't we go?
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   One, maybe we don't believe.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   And that's a simple answer. Maybe we don't believe.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   Or two, maybe we don't ask because our desires.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   That we want to ask.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   We already know that that's not what God wants for us.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.640]   So our hearts are filled with things that contradict the things that God desires for us.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   So we can't take that to God.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   You're theologically too astute.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   You don't believe in the health and wealth gospel.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   So you've already learned enough about the Bible to keep you away from God.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   Not to bring you to God.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   But theology causes you to stay away from God
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   because your life is not consistent with the things that you're learning.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   So therefore, the more you learn about God, the more you have to stay away from God.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   So it is your astute theology that prevents you from praying.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   Because this theology, if it doesn't cause you to be broken and humble and desire and to go to Him,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   then it does exactly the opposite.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.640]   We do not have because we do not pray.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   And He says even when you do pray, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   so that you may spend it on your pleasure.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.640]   The very thing that God doesn't want you to have.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.640]   Your heart's filled with that.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   So even if you're bold enough to go and ask Him,
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   He said God can't give it to you because He knows He's going to destroy you.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   Those of you who are stingy, don't ask for money.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   It will destroy you.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   It will destroy you.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   Those of you who are not generous, don't ask for money.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   Because the money that you get is going to fill you with pride and arrogance and pleasure
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   that's going to drive you away from God.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.640]   So God's not going to answer a prayer that's going to ultimately ruin you.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.640]   So if you're stingy and you're not good at managing money,
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   and all the money is being spent for your own pleasure,
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   don't ask God to make your business better.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   God, when is the right time to buy a house so that I can make a good investment and make more money?
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   Because more money to you is going to ruin you.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   That's what He said.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   Either we don't pray, or when we do pray, God can't answer that.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   A Christian who is content without prayer is a very dangerous person.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   Because whatever success he experiences without prayer is going to ruin him.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   Because he thinks he's done it.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   I did it.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   I made these changes, and I made these implementations,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.640]   and I worked hard, and I was properly educated, and therefore this is what's happening.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   And so you're filled with pride.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   So a Christian who is filled with pride automatically becomes a critical Christian.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   Not only am I good, you don't live up to my standard.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   So it ruins that person.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   A worst thing a Christian can experience is superficial success without Christ.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   Because the more successful you are, the more it drives you away from God.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   A best thing that can happen to any Christian is whatever causes us to get on our knees.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   Whatever causes us to feel helpless is the best thing.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   Whatever causes you to pray.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   Whatever causes you to come before God, beating the chest, saying, "I need you.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.640]   I need you. Not just want you, I need you."
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   Whatever causes you to be in that situation is what God is constantly driving us to.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:42.640]   My hope and prayer is that I would not have to be forced to be on that situation.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   But I would be sober enough when I wake up that I would feel helpless.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   Not only when I'm sick, not only when I feel like my plans didn't go right,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   but every day I wake up knowing the spiritual battle that we're in that I feel helpless.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   And that my helplessness would cause me to pray.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   That every single day, every single Christian wake up knowing that we have an adversary
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   who is eagerly waiting to devour us.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   That you and I do not have the human power to resist it.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   And to know that every day, wake up every morning knowing that, that would drive us to Him.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   That is the safest and the healthiest place for any Christian to be.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   To desperately need prayer.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   To not be praying regularly and then somebody asks you, "How are you doing?"
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.640]   and you say, "Good," you're in danger.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.640]   Because you don't know the attacks that you're under.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   You don't know the scheming that you've already surrendered to.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   If you say, "I'm good."
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   And you don't have the armor of God on.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   It says to gird up your loins, right?
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   To engage in the spiritual battle, you need to gird up your loins.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   You know what girding up the loin literally means?
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   It's to make your skirt into a pants.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   That's what that means, right?
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   Those are my words, but if you look at the pictures, that's what it is.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   You know, they're wearing these long gowns and basically you take the back part out.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   I mean, we see some of the ladies do that, right?
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   When they're ready to make kimchi or something.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   They got it on the ground ready for action.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   You got to tie it up and tie the side.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.640]   And basically, if you look at it, you turn the skirt into a pants.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.640]   Because you need to get ready for action.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   That's what that literally means, to get ready for action.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:38.640]   So, if you're living your life on vacation, you don't have to worry about action.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   If you're going to go into battle and you're going to fight, you don't want your clothing flapping around.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   You're going to be ready, right?
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.640]   That's why in Job chapter 38 verse 3, Job at the end of his life is just so tired and he's complaining to God.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   And God finally shows up and this is what he said, "Now gird up your loins like a man."
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   In other words, again, just put on your big boy pants because I got some things to say to you.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   "Gird up your loins like a man and I will ask you and you instruct me.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   You're so bold to tell me what I'm doing wrong. Now I'm here. Put on your pants.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   Tell me. Tell me now that I'm in front of you."
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   So, he goes through a series of things that God's going to show him who he is.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   And every statement that he makes, he says, first of all, "Gird up your loins like a man."
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   Put your pants on.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   That's what he says. First and foremost, praying the Spirit means to be ready.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   If you're going into 2024 and you made a bucket list of things that you want to experience,
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   the food that you want to taste, and the places that you want to go,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   and none of that has anything to do with the spiritual battle,
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   then maybe it's time to gird up your loins.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   We need to begin by reminding ourselves that we're in spiritual battle.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   We're in war.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   In Jeremiah 117, when God calls him to battle, he said,
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   "You're going to go and you're going to preach my word
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   and tell them that because of their sin, judgment is coming."
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.640]   He tells Jeremiah, "Now gird up your loins and arise and speak to them all which I command you.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   Do not be dismayed before them or I will dismay you before them."
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   God is preparing Jeremiah to face the hostility of the people that he will be preaching the word to,
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   and they're going to hate his guts.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, every time that guy opens his mouth, he has nothing good to say.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   He's not encouraging at all.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   He's not seeker-friendly. He's seeker-hostile.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   Every time he opens his mouth, nobody is happy, but that's the message that God gave him.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   And that's why he said, "Gird up your loins. I'm not sending you on vacation.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   I'm not sending you on a cruise ship to kind of encourage people.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   I'm going to send you to these people who's going to hate your guts because of the message I'm giving you.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   So gird up your loins. Get ready for action."
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   In Luke 12, 35-36, "Be dressed in readiness and keep your lamp lit.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.640]   so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks."
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   Are you preparing, 2024, for the spiritual battle that you and I have already been called to?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   It's just to gird up your loins. Be ready.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.640]   And that's why he says to put on the full armor of God.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.640]   Not just peasants, not just the sword, but the full armor of God.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:47.640]   Now, if we're just playing house, if you're going to Disneyland and you're dressed up like a warrior
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   to entertain people, then it doesn't matter.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   You may have your legs vulnerable, your chest vulnerable, your side vulnerable.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   It doesn't matter because it's just for show.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   But if you're actually dressing up for battle, you know that your enemy is going to see
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   whatever areas of your life that's vulnerable, and you know that's where the attack is coming.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   If you're struggling with purity, that's where the attack is going to keep coming.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   If your problem with is money, that's where the attack is going to keep coming.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.640]   Because the enemy is constantly scheming.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   If your idol is your children, that's where the attack is going to keep coming.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   Wherever the armor is vulnerable is where the enemy is going to be placing his sword.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   And that's why he says put on the full armor of God.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   Gird up your loins. Put on the feet.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   Preparation for the gospel of peace.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   Be ready for action.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   You could tell what, like when my kids dress up to go out,
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   I know exactly like what they're planning to do.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   If they put on slippers, right?
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   And I said, oh, they're going to hang out with their friends.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   Or maybe they're going to go bowling or, you know.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   Well, even for bowling you need proper shoes, right?
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   But if they're wearing slippers out of the house, they're not going to do anything active.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   But I know when they're going to go play sports or something.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   They're putting shoes on. They got the right attire on.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   So I don't have to ask them, right?
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   Are you going hiking or are you going, you know?
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   Because I know based upon how you dress.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   So the question is, spiritually, do you have slippers on?
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Or do you have the gospel of peace foot gear on, ready?
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   Are your loins girdled?
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   Do you have pants on?
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   Or is it skinny jeans?
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   Which is it, right?
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   What do you have on?
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   In your mindset, right?
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   Before we talk about anything specific, your mindset.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   Are you aware?
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   Are you aware of the spiritual battle?
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   Are you aware of your enemy?
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   Are you aware of the constant scheming to thwart you and to distract you
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   and fill you with pride and tempt you?
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   Are you aware of that?
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   That causes us to be sober and to cling to him?
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.640]   If you do not pray in the spirit, your spiritual life is just a theory.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   It's just a theory.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   Just like it says in 2 Timothy 3.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   It says in verse 5, "Holding on to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power."
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   And it says to avoid such men.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   A form of godliness. People who only know God in theory.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   When we talk about the love of God, it's just theoretical. It's not real.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   That's what happens.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   Prayer is what causes God to be real.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   Because you're talking to him.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   If all you've done is learn about him from a book,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   that's no different than learning about famous people from a book, from watching a movie.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   He says, "I know them because I watched a movie. I know them because I saw the interview."
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   But you don't know them.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   The people who talk to them know them.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   The people who wrote the books know them.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   People have gone to him, interacted with him, and seen his power.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   They know them. But you don't know them.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.640]   You know about them.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   And in the same way, when we don't pray,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   everything we know about God is just theory.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   And you guys already know, if anything that you learn remains a theory,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.640]   eventually you're going to lose it.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.640]   Right? You're going to lose it.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   Some of you guys studied one major,
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.640]   but if you don't use that in about five years, you're not going to remember
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   because you just learned theory.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   Only the things that you are practicing, you're going to get better at.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   So if the greatest commandment is,
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,"
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   and your relationship with God is just theoretical,
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   it's just theory that you're hearing, regurgitating, studying,
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   and maybe even memorizing,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   your affection for God never grows.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   In fact, it actually decreases.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   But when you pray in the Spirit,
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   when you feel the breath of God,
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   when God answers your prayer,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   when you're praying for the lost,
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   and he begins to show you his own heart,
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   how broken he is for the lost,
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   and you begin to sense his broken heart for the lost,
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   and when God begins to answer your prayers,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   and God starts to become real to you,
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   everything that you see what Apostle Paul is doing,
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   you will understand why he did it.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   Maybe not to the degree that he understood it,
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   but you will begin to understand every part of the Scripture,
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   not theoretically, but you'll understand why he said it,
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   why he's sitting in prison and worried for them,
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   why he's about to get his head beheaded, and he says,
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640]   "I have fought the good fight. I'm ready."
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   Why Apostle Paul is writing and saying,
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.640]   "If you were to ask me, I'd prefer dying than going to the Lord,
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.640]   but I know it's more beneficial for you, so I'll stay and bear more."
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   You'll understand that when you understand the breath of God in you.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   That's why he says to pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   So as we face 2024, our church has a reputation
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   of being a Bible-centered church.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   What is equally important is that we need to be people who pray.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   Equally important. It's not number one and number two.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   It's call number one.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   When the apostles established the seven deacons,
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   he says, "So that we can devote ourselves to word and prayer."
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   All of us, not just the apostles, not just the pastors, all of us,
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   that we need to be equally committed to the word and to prayer.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   That's why, even if it's for the next 10 or 20 years
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   that this is going to be our theme, and we move only inches,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   as long as it is in the right direction,
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.640]   we're going to keep emphasizing this, because this is that important.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   We need to be a church that prays.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   That the fruit that we bear is because the Holy Spirit is answering our prayers.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   I pray at the minimum, right?
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   I'm going to be preaching about what it means to pray in the Spirit.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   So today was part one, next week will be part two,
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   next third week will be part three,
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   and that will prepare our team to go out to India.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   That at least, at least, even if you struggle for the rest of the year,
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   that at the least, in your psyche, in your memory,
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.640]   that you understand just how critical this is.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.640]   That we devote ourselves to prayer in 2024.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.640]   Let's pray.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   Father, as you continue to show kindness to us,
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   as you continue to show patience and mercy,
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.640]   Lord, teach us, guide us, and lead us to pray.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   To pray effectively, to pray for all things,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   to pray unceasingly, but ultimately to pray in the Spirit.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   Help us, Lord God, that 2024,
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.640]   that you would move us, guide us, sanctify us,
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   that we would truly be a house of prayer.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.640]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   [silence]
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   [music]
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   Sing, "As we seek."
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:09.640]   As we seek your face,
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   may we know your heart.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:23.640]   Feel your presence, acceptance,
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   as we seek your face.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   As we seek.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   As we seek your face,
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   may we know your heart.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   Feel your presence, acceptance,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   as we seek your face.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.640]   [music]
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   At your feet.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   At your feet we fall,
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   Sovereign Lord.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   We cry, "Holy, holy!"
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   At your feet we fall.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   [music]
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   Sing, "Jesus, draw me close."
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   Jesus, draw me close.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:53.640]   Closer, Lord, to you.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   Let the world around me fade away.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   [music]
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:14.640]   Jesus, draw me close.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Closer, Lord, to you.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   For I deserve to worship and obey.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   Jesus, draw me close.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   Jesus, draw me close.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   Closer, Lord, to you.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   Let the world around me fade away.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   [music]
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   Jesus, draw me close.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   Closer, Lord, to you.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   For I desire to worship
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   and for I desire to worship
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   and for I desire to worship and obey.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.640]   Amen.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.640]   and to make you stand in the presence of His glory,
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   blameless with great joy,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.640]   before all time and now and forever.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   Amen.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   God sent His Son.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   He lived and died to buy my portion.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   An empty grave is there to heal my Saviorless.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   Because I know He holds the future
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   and life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   Amen.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   [music]
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.640]   [music]
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640]   [music]
