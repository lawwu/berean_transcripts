[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   Otherwise, we can take time to give it digitally.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   Heavenly Father, we truly do thank you for your mercies are upon us, for your grace is given to us.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   God, we are sometimes just, you know, amazed that to undeserving people, you lavished your love.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   And then what's more, day to day, you lead us and instruct us as our God.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   So for all of that, we praise you and lift you up.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   During this time, Lord, when we're joined together, we want to exalt you.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   We want to praise your name.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   And we pray, God, that as our faith, in faith, we sing to you.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.120]   And by faith, we hear your word and are challenged.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   That all the things that take place here would be pleasing in your sight.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.120]   We also pray, God, for the offering.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.120]   That it would truly be an expression of our gratitude.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   And Father, we pray that the offering would be used to your glory and for your kingdom.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   We ask, God, that each week we come in and come out, more and more we would be spurred on towards love, towards faith, towards good deeds.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   God, that everything would be turned to you in thanksgiving and praise.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   We honor you, God, this time.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   Amen.
