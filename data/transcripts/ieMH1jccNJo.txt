[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   be to your name, for no one could rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   Amen.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   Well, I'd like to share some reflections and encouragements for this evening.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   And as I thought about the topic of Thanksgiving,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.500]   my heart was already filled because of the Bible study we did in Genesis.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   As a matter of fact, as we're going through such huge chunks of time in history,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   such massive works of God in creation,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   in his faithfulness to the early generations,
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   a lot of the application at the end of the study is actually,
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   I just need to worship God.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.500]   Like, I want to be so thankful to my God who has been so powerful,
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.500]   so faithful through all the generations.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.500]   And for example, I found myself more, just almost thankful than ever,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   thinking about how God perseveres with man.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   So what I'm talking about is, first, as one example, God created us with like an embedded image of the Lord.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   And that alone is to be something that a reason why we praise God.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   But when we think about that, with the fall, with the perversion, and the kind of repeat theme of anything good that God has given,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   sinful man, corrupted man, tends to pervert and twist.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   We saw that so many times.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   But then to think that after God had seen a generation chock full of people where the only thing in their heart, the scripture said that every intent of their heart was evil continually.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   He saw that, judged them.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   And then upon Noah and eight individuals coming out of the ark, he said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   Now, I took a moment to just stop and meditate on that.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   I meditated on it myself.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   Then I shared it with our youth group.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   And I was just thinking, think how actually crazy that is.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   Where God knows not just one week out, one month out.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   God knows the future.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   God knows the way of man.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   So then for him to continue to execute his plan, beside the fact that we have such a propensity, beside the fact that it's not just, hey, this is risky.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.500]   If you give these people numbers, if you allow these people to spread, it's not like that's surprising to God.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:54.500]   But his design was already that he desired for mankind to be fruitful, to multiply and spread and fill the earth.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   So he gave them that commandment, and there was a part of me that was like, of course, if you're going to kill all the wicked ones,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:09.500]   and then you start over, in a sense, or you have a new, new generation of individuals, of course you give that command.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   But actually, take a moment to pause and think, God could have said something else.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   He could have said, "I spared you. Please don't multiply."
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.500]   If you think about it, it's kind of funny, right?
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   And as a matter of fact, if there was somebody you knew, where you knew that they were out for you, they were rebellious, they were malicious,
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:36.500]   and the intent of their heart was wicked, I don't think you would say, "Please, please, I hope you're really fruitful."
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.500]   You'd probably say, "Dude, please don't have any children."
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   Because why would you want that thing, want that group to continue to proceed into the generations?
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:53.500]   And so I think about that, and I think, "The purposes of God will not be thwarted by the sins of man."
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   And when I think about that, what's the application?
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.500]   The application is, "God, we praise you."
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:07.500]   Besides the fact that so many times and so many seasons, we have not obeyed,
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   we have gone wayward as a whole of a people, you still accomplish your plan, and there's nothing to thwart that.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   Even if every intent of man was so different, but God, your plan is good.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   And so for that, we just have to thank the Lord.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:33.500]   God is so grand in His power, His control, and then His absolute execution of whatever He deems to be good.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   And in some sense, I always wondered, Scripture actually says, like, "Who are you to be God's counselor?"
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   And there were a lot of times where even the people of God was like, "Hey, hey, don't! Don't bless these people!"
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   You guys remember Jonah who was like, "I knew it! If you preach the gospel to these people,
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   you're going to give them mercy, they're going to repent, and then you're going to spare them!"
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   And then God says, "I didn't ask you to be my counselor."
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   He has a mercy that He desires to give, and He will execute that plan.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   And so for that, we couldn't do another but to thank Him.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.500]   A second example of going through the Bible study,
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   and I'm just really sharing my own personal reflection and my own thoughts of this is,
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.500]   I just started to imagine being one of the eight individuals that walked off the boat,
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   waiting 40 days of just pure rain, springs, and gusts of water coming from every which direction,
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.500]   destroying everything, 150 days of waiting for the water to subside,
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.500]   not knowing when it's going to really happen, and then it comes to rest,
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   and then you being one of the first people to walk out.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   That's a crazy scene.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.500]   Like I don't know what I would do.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   If you would do the dance, you know, like start twirling around like in the dramas,
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   or you do the crazy thing and start kissing the sand.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.500]   I don't know. I don't know what you'd do.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.500]   But Pastor Peter, there was a moment I just distinctly remember he asked a funny question,
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   which was, if you were one of the very first people,
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   and then you started thinking about how to rebuild, how to live,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   where are we going to build our house, where do we get all this stuff,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   but then the first rain came.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   How would you feel?
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   I don't know why, but that question made me laugh so hard inside.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   I was actually in the side room by myself, and I was just giggling to myself because I just,
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500]   you know, it's kind of comedic.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.500]   Like you think about it, and you think half of you would just be like, no.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   The other half would be like, who did it?
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   Which one of you guys messed up?
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   Maybe part of you would just tell everybody, get back in the boat right now.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   And somebody may be like, oh, I don't know. Let's wait this out.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   And you're just like, no, get back in there.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   You would just panic.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   And then it just hit me that God's promise of a visible sign,
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.500]   God's desire to reassure the heart of man,
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   that's just 100% grace.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.500]   That's 100% mercy.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   And then I keep thinking, what's the application to that?
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   I don't know.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   When God is trying to reassure your heart, what's the application?
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   You just thank him and receive.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   To reassure your heart, thank you, God, that when you spare me, I don't have to be in fear.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   What if you take this back?
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   What if the hand of mercy you extended to me, you say, nah, on second thought, never mind.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:39.500]   And then I remember that actually scripture says in Romans chapter 10, I extend my hand all day long to an obstinate people.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   God's extended mercy comes by way of reassuring us.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.500]   Sometimes I wonder, why does God have to repeat a lot of the things?
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   It's because we're hard of learning.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   But our God is a God who is willing to repeat the same lesson over and over again.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   That's just 100% mercy.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   Our God is such a good father that he tends to our fear.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   Our God is such a good God that he is not aloof when we're wrought with anxiety.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   He's not so far that he doesn't see our worries.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   That's just pure mercy and grace.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   And so I had such an emotional moment sitting in the room, first laughing, then wanting to cry, then realizing my application is I want to thank my God.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   He is a merciful God that he is the one who tells us when you are afraid, trust me.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   And I remember Pastor Peter going through that lesson saying, when you see this, this is a time to trust God.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:48.500]   When you see his promises, the part of the Noahic covenant and what we just read is an anchor and another staple point of God being so faithful.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   He is worthy of 100% of our trust.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   And that's just so amazing.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   So then I kind of think like, we should be so thankful.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500]   And then I start to imagine a little bit more.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:18.500]   And then obviously the conviction of, oh my gosh, if I actually was one of the eight people who came out, and I experienced this near death moment, then of course I would be just so elated I'd probably be on my knees.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   And came to the conviction it's unfortunate that sometimes like, near death experiences, it's what causes us to be so moved to gratitude.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:38.500]   But we who have the name of Christ, we who have salvation, we who have the greatest deliverance of all.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   In a sense, such a great deliverance, such a grand deliverance that deliverance from the flood pales in comparison to the deliverance we have from the wrath of God.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   The full wrath of God.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500]   The full wrath of God.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   Why do we need near death experiences to be so thankful?
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500]   That's what I started to ask myself.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.500]   But what's more, as I think about this then, it's just all the scriptures that admonish us.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   The first Thessalonians five that says rejoice.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   The reason why the scriptures can command us is because of this.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500]   We are delivered people.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   We are people who have had near death experiences.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   It's just that maybe we don't see it with our eyes, but the fact of the matter is there is a near death waiting wrath for every person who doesn't have Christ.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   And so we who gather, we're like survivors, you know?
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   Not because we made shelter and we made all this stuff on the island, but because we've been spared.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   And then so I started thinking like, wow.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   So that's, that's the reason why it just makes sense that we have to be thankful for everything.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   Every single thing.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   You know, have you met those individuals who maybe are a little bit more on the, I don't know what the word is, but the best way I can describe it is like a hippie.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   You know, they're like, wow, look at this clouds.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.500]   They look at the sun and they're like, look at that sunset.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   It's amazing.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   And they start welling up because so beautiful.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   And then there are people who just appreciate everything.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   And then you're almost like, eh, don't overdo it.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   You know, like all the butterflies, so beautiful.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.500]   And then they see children are, you know, everything's so beautiful.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   And then you're just like, ah, it's just awkward, you know?
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:31.500]   And half of you wants to say, wow, you just shouldn't be so thankful over the small things because we're thankful over the big things.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   But again, if you think about somebody who's been spared from not just near death experience, but the greatest judgment ever.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   Then it only makes sense that everything and anything you're thankful for.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   It doesn't make sense for a Christian to be like, I'm so grateful for the grandeur of salvation.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   And then they're just not thankful for where they live, the car they drive, the people they hang out with, the church that they go to.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   Like that just is a complete disconnect, right? Complete disconnect.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   And on the flip side, obviously, it's a disconnect.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   If you're so thankful for all the little things on earth, but you never look up to see the grandeur of the spiritual reality.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   For us, it only makes sense to be thankful for every single thing.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   And then, so that leads me to the final thought is, man, here at church, it's, I think about what I'm thankful for in this season.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   I think about what my life consists of.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.500]   And I have so many blessings here at church.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.500]   I am surrounded by fellow survivors.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   I'm surrounded by people I can rejoice with.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   And then these moments that I have where I get all emotional and I reflect on God, I get to turn around and say, isn't that amazing?
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   And then we just rejoice together.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   That's a huge privilege, you know?
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   That's a huge privilege.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   And then I realized this is, this was God's plan.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   All along, that his wisdom will be played out in the church.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:14.500]   And all of us, spared, lavished, loved by God, will come together, unite our voices, and just thank God.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   This was it.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   What's happening right now in all the regional homes.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   What's happening right now in the church right now.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   What's happening right now.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   This is what's his design.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   And he deserves all of it.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   Amen.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   I think about Genesis and I just realized God deserves every ounce of gratitude we have.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   Because everything we have, we have from the hand of God.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   There is not a single thing, not a single moment in which we have created for ourselves.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   But everything has been mercifully given to us.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   And we're so grateful.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   And I pray that as that is the case, we would do exactly what Noah did.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   Not what I would do.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   But what Noah did.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   Worship first.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.500]   I kind of thought about that because recently I just moved.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   And I got to be honest with you.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.500]   Sometimes I just so tunnel vision.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   If you move, then you got to clean.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   And oh my gosh, we got to clean.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   Because if you don't clean before the stuff furniture is put in, then you got to remove it again.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   And then clean it.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   And everything has a sequence.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   And in survival, it's like that too.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   You think, oh my gosh, you know what comes first is shelter.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   Then the next thing is water.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   It's not actually food.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   It's water.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   Because you can go a little bit without food.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.500]   And then you got food.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   And then so I would say, you know, the ladies, you go pick up whatever is dead on the floor.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   And you could eat.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   And then go pick it up.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.500]   And then the guys, you start building the shelter and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, right?
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   But with the heart of gratitude, let's all remember, just like Pastor Peter said during our Sunday sermon,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   priority is worship first.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   And I'm so thankful for the study in Genesis.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   Because these pages just come alive with, let us all join our hearts, giving thanks to God. Amen.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   And I want to give you this encouragement and challenge.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   If there is in any season, any particular milestone, any particular moment, a lot of you guys have either maybe sometimes moved from job to job.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   You actually move physically.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   You, you know, go into a new stage of life.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   You get married.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   Let's do worship and thanksgiving first.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   Because there's always a million things to do.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.500]   But God deserves every ounce of recognition.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   Let's pray together.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   Heavenly Father, we thank you and bless your name.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   You're worthy of it all.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   Thank you, God, that the security of our lives is not simply in how well we prepare.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   But what we need to prepare is our hearts for you.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   And I pray, God, that you would minister to us in such a way where our spiritual eyes and our spiritual senses would be in tune and we would recognize you in our lives.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:36:01.500]   Help us to see that in every moment you're the one sustaining, providing, leading, guiding, protecting, and loving us.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   And I pray, Father God, that with our voices and our hearts gathered, we want to truly say thank you from our hearts.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   We bless you.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   Amen.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   Well, that concludes our time together for the teaching portion.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   But we encourage you guys to get into groups, have some discussion.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   I'm going to give three suggested questions just related to when you are most aware.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   You know, when are you not just maybe a death-defying moment, but other moments when the scriptures hit you or someone came into your life.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   When you are super aware of God's grace and provision for you.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   There's also a question on how prioritizing gratitude and worship can take effect in your life even now.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   And then finally, because the church is a place where we can actually express our gratitude the best amongst the life, through the life of the church and through our participation in it.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   Just share, what kind of mercies of God did you experience?
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   What kind of things can you do within the church to express your heart of gratitude to the Lord?
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   All right.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   Blessings, everyone.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   Thank you.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:42.480]   Thank you.
