[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   Good morning and welcome to Bryn Community Church.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   We have quite a few announcements to get through.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   First of all, next Sunday is members meeting.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   And so we will be having fundraiser lunch that's going to be given by the Korea Mission team.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   So please stick around for that.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   And then our members meeting is going to start right at 2 o'clock.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   So if you can't make it, please give us a heads up and let us know ahead of time.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   On May 18th, that's in two Sundays, two or three Sundays.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   On 11 through 3 p.m., there's going to be a family ministry picnic.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   So this is open for anyone who's part of the family ministry from 11 to 3.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   It's going to be a casual gathering.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   Just grab your own lunch and go there.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   And we'll be eating together and just visiting with other family members to get to know them.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   So again, it's on May 18th from 11 to 3 p.m.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.920]   During the summer, we have a spiritual development classes.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   So we've shortened our regular Bible study that we have.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   Usually this session would last all the way up to June.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   But then the reason why we shortened it to 10 weeks is because we're trying to cover certain topics
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   that we believe will be helpful to the church.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   So there's three topics that are going to be covered,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   Bible study sessions that are going to be offered during the summertime.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   And all three of them are at different times and at different lengths.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.920]   So you're going to have to look that up when you go see it.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   There's three classes that are offered.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   One is foundation of marriage class.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   So if you are engaged and you need to take marriage class, this is a requirement for you.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   And then for everybody else, this is open to you as well.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   Whether you've been married for two years or 15 years or 30 years,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   you feel like this will be a benefit to you.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   The foundations of marriage is going to be taught by all the pastors.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   We're going to be taking turns.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   And then in between, we're going to be pairing you up with other couples
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   to kind of practice and fellowship with other people based on the things that you've learned.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   So if you are part of the family ministry, you're invited to that.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   You don't necessarily have to be married.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   You feel like this is going to benefit you, you can also sign up.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.920]   So we don't have any limit for that.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   There will be child care provided, and it will start sometime in May, sometime at the end of May.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   And then the second class are fourfold disciplines of the Christian life.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   So this is for daily devotions, prayer, evangelism, fellowship.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   And so it's going to be more of a practice.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   There's going to be brief teaching, and then we're going to be practicing
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   based upon whichever groups that you get placed in.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   It's not like a small group, but there will be different places throughout the city.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   Different parts where you'll be gathered together to practice the things that we're going over.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   And that will take place on Wednesday nights.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   No child care is provided for that, and it will be on campus on Wednesday nights at the end.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   I think the first date is at the end of May.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   Child care is provided for foundation of marriage, just a heads up.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   And then another class, parenting class, that's going to be sometime in July.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   So if you want to take that class, that child care is provided for that as well.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   That's going on on Thursday nights.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   So Wednesday nights are fourfold disciplines of Christian life.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   Foundations of marriage will be on Thursday.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   And then parenting will also be on Thursday.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   But again, the times are different.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920]   So this is not mandatory.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   If you feel like this is going to be beneficial for you, we ask that you would sign up.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   And so this is the reason why we shortened our regular Bible study,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   so that we can address certain topics that we feel like were beneficial to the church.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   So please sign up for that.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Along with that, a summer seeker group.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   On Wednesday nights, starting from May 28th, there's going to be a seeker's group.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   So if you are interested and you have questions about the gospel,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   you want to interact with Pastor Mark or different people in the outreach team,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   they're going to be doing a Bible study going over fundamental understanding of Christianity and the gospel.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   So if you think that will benefit you, or you know somebody that you think will benefit,
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   please sign up for that, and the first class is happening on May 28th at 7 p.m.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   Okay?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   Berean Men's and Women's Softball Tournament, or Mission Softball Tournament,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   is happening on May 24th.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   So if you already signed up, you probably got an email.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   There is a -- I think there is a practice happening starting today.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   I don't know -- is Tim in this room somewhere?
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   Okay, he's not in this service.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   Oh, there you are.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   So there is practice today?
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Okay, so there is practice today.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   So if you signed up and you got an email, please show up.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   And even if you didn't and you want to play, please sign up for that,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   and then they'll put you into various teams.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   There may be a team that is co-ed.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   So if you are interested in playing and your skill level for that team needs to be higher than normal, okay,
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   meaning like if you play softball and you feel like you've played co-ed softball before
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   because we don't want our sisters getting hurt in that tournament.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   And so there are a few other churches that are coming with that.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   There's not a lot of space, so if you're interested in playing, please let Tim know,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   and then they'll place you in that.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   For the men, your skill level doesn't matter.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   So we have all the way from advanced to beginners.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   So you'll be placed on -- distributed accordingly.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   So if you want to play, you can come out to that.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   And then finally -- no, actually that's it.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   All right, that was it.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   All right, so let me pray for us for the offering.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   And then if you did bring a physical offering, there is an offering box in the back.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   And then after our main worship, Luke Chow, our brother, is going to come give his testimony
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   All right, let's pray.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.920]   Thank you for the love that we understand.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Thank you, Father God, for the tremendous patience and grace that you show us every day.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   Often that we are unaware of.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   I pray that each time we gather together that you'd open our eyes to see just what a treasure we have in you,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   so that our response may simply be a reasonable response to what you've given us.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   I pray that you would bless this time, bless our worship, bless the giving that we give.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   May it be used wisely, prudently for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   Amen. Give me a seat.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   Good morning, Church family.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   My name is Luke Chau, and this is my testimony.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   I never grew up in the Church.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   I never had any formulated opinions of God or any higher power,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   not knowing if when we went to heaven
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   or if we disappeared into nothing when we died.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   Growing up, I was living deeply in sin.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   In high school, I was arrogant and self-absorbed.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.920]   I believed that I was more important than those around me,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   thinking that I had more interesting things to say than my peers.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   In my arrogance, I thought that I was better than everyone else.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   Oftentimes, I would compare myself to my classmates
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   and view myself as either physically or intellectually superior.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   Believing it to be such an achievement,
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   I took so much pride in taking so many APs,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   thinking I was better because my schedule was harder
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   than everyone else in my class.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   I looked down on those around me who would struggle in my classes,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   scoffing at how much work they had to put into passing their class.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   Furthermore, I started believing and saying that I was always right.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   I was quick to believe that those around me were wrong
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   and that I was correct whenever an issue occurred.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   In my senior year of high school,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   I started going to church with my family.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   It was here that I first heard the gospel.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   Hearing that Jesus Christ came down from heaven to save us
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   sparked a curiosity in me to hear more about our Savior.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   I started attending church regularly and made my way to Berean a few months later.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   I heard about our total depravity from God
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   and a message of repentance and why we needed a Savior.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   I also learned that we need to turn away from our sins in order to follow Christ.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   At this point, I started to form head knowledge of the gospel and who God was,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   but I was not ready to surrender my will to God.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   I still didn't understand my desperate need for a Savior.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   At the end of the summer, I was getting ready to go to Cal Poly SLO.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   However, my mom was still uneasy about sending me to college,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   worried for my well-being.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   Back and forth we went on deciding whether or not I was going to go.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   I would push more and more, trying to convince my mom
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   that I would work hard for a good degree
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   and to find a church where I could grow in faith.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   I would work hard for a degree and to find a church where I could grow in faith.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   I truly wanted to believe that I would grow more in faith in college,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   but deep down I knew that I wanted to go to Cal Poly SLO for worldly desires.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   I wanted to find a girl, party, have fun, and be away from my family without supervision.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   It was at this point when I started to feel that I had in one hand church
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   and in the other hand the college experience.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   A few weeks before my final deadline of rescinding my admission,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   I went to a party with my friends.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   When I got home, I was confronted by my mom,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   who knew immediately that I had been drinking.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   She told me if I was going to drink at home,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   I was going to drink and party at college.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   I tried to deny it, saying that I still wanted to go for my degree and to go in godliness.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   However, the more I told this lie, the less I believed it.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   After a week or so, my family sat me down and asked me why I wanted to go to college.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   I repeated this lie one more time before my sister, who normally doesn't get too mad,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   got very angry at me.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   She told me that I was being extremely selfish in my actions
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   and that I would disobey my parents so blatantly after how much they do for me.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   At the moment, I was so angry with my sister for confronting me.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   I wanted so much to hit back and retort back at her with my own.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   It was then that I realized my selfishness and my pursuit for my own desires.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   My parents provided everything for me,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   but my actions showed that I wanted to do it on my own without their help.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.920]   But however much my parents do,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   my Heavenly Father does infinitely more,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   and my sins offend Him infinitely more.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   I depend on the Lord for everything in my life,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   yet I just disobey Him.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   When I sin against His holy name,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   I am telling Him I deny Him and that I don't want to depend on Him,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   even though I know His way is best.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   And when He extends His grace to me, I slap it away with my sin.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   How could I do this to the one that loves me most?
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   I couldn't see how my own selfishness was hurting my family
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   and how much I was sinning against the Lord.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   James 4:6 states that God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   How could I, a richest sinner, hold so much pride in my heart
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   when Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, humbled Himself to come down to save us?
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   I was finally able to see my depravity and my deep and desperate need for a Savior.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   I could not do anything on my own or rely on my own power to save me.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.920]   I needed Christ to take away my sins to wash me anew.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   This led me to repent to the Almighty Father
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   after seeing my sin laid out before my eyes.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   And God is all-satisfying.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   I no longer live in my sin, struggling to fight it every day.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   I surrender my will to the Father that I deny myself,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   pick up my cross, and follow Him wherever He leads me.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   Thank you.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   [applause]
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   [inaudible]
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   [applause]
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   All right, thank you, Luke.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   And we really praise God for what God is doing in the Chao family.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   They broke the record, all three siblings that are being baptized here.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   So we're very thankful.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 11.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   I'm going to be reading from verse 11 all the way to verse 23.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   Luke 11, verse 14 to 23.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   "He was casting out a demon, and it was mute.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.920]   But some of them said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.'
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   Others to test him were demanding of him a sign from heaven.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   But he knew their thoughts and said to them,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   'Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself, false.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out?
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   So they will be your judges.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him,
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.920]   he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied on, and distributes his plunder.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters."
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   Let's pray.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   Father, we pray that your word would speak to us powerfully.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   I pray that your word that you have ordained to go forth
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   and to not return until it has accomplished its purpose
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   would cause your children to hear the voice of Christ and to follow him.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   I pray that your word would come alive in us, mold us, guide us, revive us.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   So some of you guys may know this and some of you guys may not.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   But if you look at--if you can put up the art.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   Yeah, there you go. All right.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   You guys know what this is already.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   I don't know how many of you guys are UCI students, but have you ever asked why?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   Why that? You know what I mean?
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   Of all the things that they could have chosen as their mascot.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   Zot, zot, zot. Like this is your--you know what I mean?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   So I've always been curious, and I looked it up,
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   and it said 1965 was when they voted for this, when the school was pretty young.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   And the competing animals were eagles, unicorns, seahawks, roadrunner,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   and they won by 51%, right?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   And why? Why did this win of all the things that you could have?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   And those of you who are UCI students, how many of you know the back story behind this?
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   Yeah, almost nobody. You just accepted this.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   Like so scary. Zot, zot, zot, right?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   The back story behind this is when they were--when UCI--
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   when they were kind of voting for this in the early stages was known as like the boonie school.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   You know, I remember visiting UCI in 1985 to visit some of my friends
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   who were already in college at that time,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   and I remember thinking, getting off the freeway, I said, "Where is this?"
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   So I remember, if you lived in Orange County, anything after Anaheim was considered boonies.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   I know now it's like, you know, there's a bunch of stuff,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   and Irvine is the destination place for a lot of people,
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   but anything beyond Disneyland was kind of like, "What good thing comes out of here?"
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   You know what I mean? It was kind of like Nazareth.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   [laughter]
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.920]   So imagine if it was like that in 1980, '85, what it was like in 1965.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   So, you know, it was kind of like a school that people didn't know much about,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   and the reasoning behind it, at least from the students,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   is that an anteater seems pretty innocuous, pretty, like, tame on the surface until it is cornered.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   And they said that when it is cornered and it decides to fight, it's actually very ferocious,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   and you can look that up in the Google.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   You know, they don't just eat ants.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   They have--at the end of it, the picture doesn't show it, but it has claws at the end,
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   and they said that thing is so dangerous that if you corner it and it comes out swinging,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   it can actually be very fatal.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   And I didn't know that it actually has a name, Peter.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   Did you know that?
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   [laughter]
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.920]   It's Peter the Anteater.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   It reminds me of my childhood memories of Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater, had a wife, a kitten keeper.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   That's--that was kind of like, you know, I just--but the name behind it is Peter the Anteater.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   And again, why I share this is because we don't know--you know, I was just curious all these years
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.920]   that I've been at Irvine, why the anteater?
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   And the reason why they go "zot," it's the noise that they make when they attack.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   Now you know, okay?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   You've been doing this for no reason.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   Like, that's "zot, zot, zot," right?
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   It's not the noise that they make when they eat ants.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   This is the noise that they make when they decide, okay, I'm going to become ferocious.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   The reason why I share that this morning is because Jesus is--in Jesus' ministry,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   as he is heading toward the cross, the leaders of Israel are starting to feel cornered
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.920]   because his popularity is growing.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   And so you see that Jesus' words become much more direct and harsher when he says,
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   "You brood of vipers.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.920]   You're like a dead man's tomb, and you're always dressing on the outside,
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   but inside is filled with dead men's bones."
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   And so the leaders of Israel are starting to feel his reputation is getting stronger and stronger,
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.920]   and we need to do something about this man, so they're coming out with their claws now.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   And so Jesus actually warns us in John 16, 2-3,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   "They will make you outcasts from the synagogue," "they" meaning the Jewish leaders,
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   "but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   These things they will do because they have not known the Father or me."
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   The greatest opposition to the cause of Christ, he says,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   is going to come from who you might think are the spiritual leaders.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:09.920]   And so this text is a warning to us, an encouragement to us to stay sober.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.920]   We're going to look at the context of this.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   And again, the outline of where he's at is he's heading toward the cross.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.920]   He's got maybe about six months to possibly, depending on your timeline,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.920]   to about nine months before he gets to the cross.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   He's already fed the 5,000.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   They reject him, so now he's focused on his attention upon the disciples,
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   and it, first of all, tells us about the miracle.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   And the miracle itself is, again, is a spectacular miracle in and of itself,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.920]   but there's not a lot written about it.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   It just says a demon-possessed man was healed, and he began to talk.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   The Bible records about nine different instances where Jesus actually casts out a demon.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   So if you were to point out what miracle did Jesus perform the most,
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   at least that is recorded, it's the demon possession.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.920]   Nine times, up to 12 times if you include when Jesus gives the authority to the disciples
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   to go out and cast out demons, and they come back and say, "Hey, the demons were even subject to us."
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   So if you include all of that, there's 12 different instances that are recorded
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   of a power encounter with the demonic world, and they come back.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   And the reason why this is so important is because nothing highlights more tangibly why Jesus came.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   It says in Colossians 1:3, it says, "He rescued us from the power of darkness
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   and brought us into the kingdom of his beloved Son."
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   So the whole purpose of why Christ was going to go to the cross and be resurrected
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   was to deliver people who were under the bondage of Satan,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   so that we may be delivered into the kingdom of his Son.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   So nothing illustrates that more tangibly than the encounter with Satan.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   In this text, it's not simply about the miracle, because we've seen numerous accounts of this before.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   And it just tells us, this is what happened.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   He encounters a demon-possessed man, casts it out, and he begins to speak.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   And then the first response from the crowd is amazement, which is a natural response.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   In fact, the early church in Acts 2.43 tells us, "Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles."
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   And we often talk about how we need to be like the early church.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.920]   But early church can't be manufactured.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.920]   That's not something that the early church was filled with awe because they gathered together
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   and the teaching was so fantastic, and so there was a sense of amazement in the early church.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   Amazement happened because they encountered God.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   It's not something that happens just because you put the small groups together,
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   and if you disciple people correctly, there's going to be a sense of awe that comes in them.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   True worship is something that happens when people encounter God.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   We see that all throughout Scripture, whether it is Moses, after God delivers them from Egypt,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   whether it's Deborah, where God brings revival through her, or Hannah because God answered prayer,
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   or David because he's delivered from his enemies, or Ezra, or Mary, or Zechariah.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   Every instance in the Scripture where they just impromptu breaks out into song is after they encounter God.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   And so worship just happens.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   We don't simply worship because we stood up and we know the songs and we sang these songs.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   Worship is something, obviously, that comes out of us
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   because there's a sense of awe of what it is that we are worshiping.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   C.S. Lewis says in his book Weight of Glory,
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   "It would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   when infinite joy is offered us. We are far too easily pleased."
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   I think the greatest struggle, again, in our generation is the sense of awe,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.920]   which creates worship, which causes fellowship, sacrifice.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   But it's a natural dilemma.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   2,000 years removed from Christ walking on this earth, what causes awe in us?
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   If the sense of amazement and awe is something that naturally happened
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   because they encountered God and his power, how do we sense that?
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   How do people 2,000 years removed, just working 9 to 5, taking care of children,
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   then coming to church, and this is something that we've done for years and years and years,
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   how do we worship God with a sense of awe?
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   What causes awe in your life?
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   Maybe it's an answered prayer.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   There are times in your life when you've been praying so diligently for something
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   and God answers it, and that causes a sense of awe, and your worship is different that Sunday.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   Or maybe you've shared the gospel with somebody, and you see somebody coming to Christ.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   Like Luke was sharing this morning about his pride and what can cause a young man's pride to break.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   That really is a miracle of God.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   When you hear other people's testimony, maybe God used you to share the gospel
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   and see someone's life changing because of that, and you say, "Wow, that's amazing."
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   Even the heavens rejoice.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   I believe that the greatest place where we encounter God that causes amazement is His Word.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   The Bible tells us that when He created Adam, the distinction between Adam and all the other animals
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   is that He says He put His breath in him, and it is His breath that gave him life.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   It is His breath that caused him to be distinguished between all other creation.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   As the Bible says, because of our sins, we've been separated from Him, and the Bible says that we died.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   And that's how we check if somebody is living or if they're dead, if they're breathing or not.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.920]   So we come to the New Testament, the whole purpose of Christ's suffering and His resurrection
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.920]   is to revive dead souls.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.920]   And He says that He has put His breath into the Word of God.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   All scripture is God-breathed.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   So the very breath that He put into man, that was squashed because of our sins,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.920]   He is now causing us to encounter Him through the Word of God.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   So when we study the Bible just for history, for knowledge,
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   you can study and never encounter God, but the more you come before God to know who He is
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   and God is revealed to us because this is His primary way He reveals Himself to us,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   there's a sense of awe.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   When you begin to see the real author, not Paul, not Peter, not Mark, not John,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   and you begin to encounter God of the Bible, you begin to see a sense of awe
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   that this was not written by man.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   This was not just--this is not just history.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   You begin to see how the roots are all connected and how the God who wrote the Leviticus,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   the same God who wrote Revelation, and God of Genesis, the same God that was in the New Testament.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   And when you begin to actually see that and encounter that,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   I believe that that's the primary way that we sense awe and amazement in the presence of God.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   You see, a Christian who is not engaging in these things can regurgitate information.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   They can tell other people about someone else's testimony, but it's never yours.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   You can read the books, and you can study, and you can memorize Scripture,
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   but it's all information that's being transferred from one person to another person to another person
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   without a sense of awe and amazement.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   The first response is a natural response.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   But the rest of this morning, I want to look at how did these people,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   where the Son of God is standing before them performing these miracles,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   possibly accuse Jesus of being a demon himself.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   This text doesn't tell us who it is, but the parallel account in Matthew 12, 20-24
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   tells us that it was the Pharisees, the leaders of Israel,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   who were accusing Jesus of casting out demons by Beelzebub.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   Beelzebub, basically, at the time of Christ, was used interchangeably with Satan.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   In other words, it's the power of Satan.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   Clearly, they can't deny a miracle is taking place because they're eyewitnesses of this.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   So either this is from God, and the only other power that they know is satanic power,
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   so they have already determined he can't be from God,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   so he must be doing these miracles with satanic power.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   And this is not the only place where this happens.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   John 7, 20; John 8, 48; John 10, 20.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   Repeatedly, they say they can't deny his power and miracles.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   It cannot be from God, so therefore, it must be from Satan.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   Do you know how crazy that is, that the Son of God, performing all these miracles,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   standing before them, the God that they supposedly worship,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   not only do they not recognize him, they accuse him of being satanic.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   If you're into sports, especially basketball, you know that there's a constant debate,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   "Who's the GOAT? Who's the GOAT?"
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   And clearly, it's Michael Jordan.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   Michael Jordan, like, no debate. Michael Jordan is the GOAT.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   But it's like telling Michael Jordan, "Not only are you not the GOAT, you ruin basketball.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   You're the worst player that has ever played basketball."
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.920]   The difference between him not being the GOAT versus him being the worst player ever,
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   that's the distinction that we're seeing.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   Here's the Son of God standing before them, and they're saying that he's from Satan.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.920]   How can the leaders of Israel be this far from the truth?
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.920]   They knew the Bible better than anybody else.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   They prayed more than anybody else.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   They even evangelized.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.920]   They kept the Sabbath holy.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   If you ask any Jew in the first century who were the spiritual leaders,
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   who knew more than anybody else, it was the Pharisees.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   No, they're not like the Sadducees. They already went liberal.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   They already denied supernatural power. They denied the resurrection.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   And they were chumming up with Rome because they wanted power.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   So nobody really respected the Sadducees, even though they were the ones in power.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   But the Pharisees, they knew the Bible.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   They were closer to God, at least in their view.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   And yet these people, not every single one of them, but as a group,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   decided that Jesus must be Satanic.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.920]   How did they get this far from him?
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   We don't have to guess because the Bible records for us.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   In John 11, 47-50, after Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead,
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   they're concerned about Jesus' popularity, and this is what they say.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   "Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   and were saying, 'What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.'"
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.920]   In other words, they can't deny these signs.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   "If we let him go on like this, all men will believe in him,
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   But one of them, Caiaphas, who was a high priest that year, said to them,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   'You know nothing at all, nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.'"
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   First of all, the reason why they were calling him Satan is because
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   they were setting up the theological basis why they needed to crucify him.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   They can't crucify the Messiah. They can't crucify the king.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   So they were basically setting out and beginning to spread the word that he is Satanic.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   So they're doing the nation a favor.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   So they were setting out a theological basis for what they've already planned to do.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   But the reasoning behind that, it says,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   "If this man keeps getting popular, it's going to take away our place."
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   It was much more personal than theological.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.920]   That they've established their place in this religious order,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   and they've connected their power with the well-being of the nation.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   And so if Jesus begins to gain in power, it's threatening their position.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   So they have to get rid of him at all costs.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   I don't know about you, but that sounds a lot like what's happening in politics today.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   I don't need to mention it, but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   People who are in power, who are being threatened,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   are going to use their power to protect themselves, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:04.920]   And in John 12.10 it says, "But the chief priests in the plan planned to put Lazarus to death also,
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   because on account of him, many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus."
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   They actually wanted to kill Lazarus.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   They acknowledged that a miracle happened, that he was risen from the dead,
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   and Jesus is the one that did it.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   And they couldn't deny it.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:30.920]   But instead of seeing that as a miracle of God, they said, "They're threatening us."
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   It was their desire for self-preservation that caused them to be this blind.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   As much as we want to look at this and say, "Thank God I'm not dead."
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   If I was in the first century, I would have been like the disciples.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   Maybe I wouldn't have been perfect, but I think I would have recognized it.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   But what caused them to be this blind was self-preservation.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   Self-preservation.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.920]   Because they wanted to stay in power.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   They wanted acknowledgment.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   They wanted to hold on to what they worked so hard to gain.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   That's why Jesus said, "If you want to follow after me, you must deny yourself and pick up your cross."
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   You can serve God, preach the gospel, study theology, all for self-glory.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   And become completely blinded to God.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   All in the name of God.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   Just like Jesus said, "These leaders, when they kill you, they're going to say, 'We're doing it for God.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   It's for God. It's for righteousness that we're doing this.'"
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   It was for self-preservation.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   In Psalm chapter 1, verse 1, it says, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers."
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   You see the progression of their sin?
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   As somebody was walking according to the principle of this world,
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   he's going to eventually be numbered with the sinners.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   He's going to be just like everybody else.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   And then eventually, he says, he's going to sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   Their progression against Christ did not happen overnight.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   They didn't see his power.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   They didn't see him opening the blind.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.920]   Eyes of the blind and all of that. You know, that must be satanic.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   It was a gradual progression because they were unwilling to humble themselves.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   They were unwilling to let go of their own glory.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   And as a result of that, the more popular he became, the more threatened they became,
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:38.920]   and the more threatened they became, the more they had to put him in the other category.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   Because he's from God, that means everything that we built up was wrong.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   Everything that we were pursuing was wrong.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.920]   Not just Sundays, not just my theology, everything was wrong.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   Where I find hope, where I find peace, where I find life, my desire for popularity,
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   my desire to be recognized, all of it was wrong.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:12.920]   The irony of all of this is that the Bible says when Satan, when the demons see Jesus,
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.920]   they recognize him, Luke 4, 41.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God."
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   But rebuking them, he would not allow them to speak because they knew him to be the Christ.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:32.920]   The leaders of Israel, the people who were studying the Bible,
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   people were proselytizing, saying that he's satanic.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   And yet the demons were afraid because they knew for a fact he was the Christ, the Son of God.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   Luke 8, 28, seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before him and said in a loud voice,
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   "What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   I beg you, do not torment me."
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   Because they recognized who Jesus was, they were terrified.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   Yet the leaders of Israel, leaders of Israel who were constantly memorizing the Torah, were so blind.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   As much as we would like to look at this and say, "Man, thank God I'm not a Pharisee.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   Thank God I'm not like the Pharisees. Thank God I'm not blind like them.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   Thank God I have the Scriptures. Thank God that's not me."
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   Do you think the Pharisees knew that they were Pharisees?
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   No, they convinced themselves that they were right.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   And the root cause of this is self-preservation.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.920]   Who's going to blame you for self-preservation?
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   It seems like of all the sins that you can commit,
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   all the rebellion and idolatry that we would be guilty of,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   they were just trying to preserve themselves.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   Which we all struggle with.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   After I take care of myself, after I pay my bills, after my children are taken care of,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   after our safety is up, after enough money is in the retirement,
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   after, after, after, self-preservation is at the core of where we're at.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   But the Scripture says their primary deceit was they were afraid to lose their power.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   And as a result, they became blind.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   And because Jesus kept them calling them out, they decided that he must go.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   The second group of people were skeptics.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   They weren't outright saying, "You're of the devil."
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   But they were demanding that he give proof.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   On the surface, it looks like, didn't Jesus himself say that we should ask, seek, and knock?
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Even Thomas, when he doubted the resurrected Christ, he said, "Let me see your scars."
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   And then he showed it to them. He didn't rebuke them for that.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   But you notice here, by the language, that they're not asking serious questions.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   They're not saying, "If you would just give me enough proof.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   I really want to obey you. I really want to follow you."
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   No, he's saying they're demanding proof.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   Think about all Christ has done.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   This is two plus years of showing miracles, sign after sign after sign after sign.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   And basically, they're saying it's not enough.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   We need more.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.920]   They're not asking for signs.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.920]   They're questioning him.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   This was willful ignorance.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   In Luke 11.29, Jesus responds to them by saying, "The crowds were increasing.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.920]   He began to say, 'This generation is a wicked generation.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   It seeks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.'"
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   He said, "If you are shaky, and if you're genuinely not certain,"
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   he said, "I left enough signs for you to know, if you really want to know."
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   He said he's going to leave the sign of his resurrection.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   We just came off of Resurrection Sunday, and I mentioned a few.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   The thing that really stood out to me when I was a young Christian is there was a Harvard law professor
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:23.920]   named Simon Greenleaf, and he was a professor of evidence,
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   and he was one of the founding professors of Harvard Law School.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   One of the students challenged him, "Because you are an expert of evidence,
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   use your knowledge and know-how of the legal structure, and can you disprove the resurrection?"
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   So he, in his arrogance, thought, "You know what? I'm going to finally put this to rest,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   and I'm going to show them that this is a ridiculous premise."
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   So he spent years gathering evidence like he would take it to the court of law,
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   thinking that he was going to disprove legally that this couldn't have happened.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   At the end of his study, he becomes a Christian.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   Not only does he become a Christian, he becomes an evangelist.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   He writes a book called The Testimony of the Evangelist, and he says,
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   "If any unbiased – again, any unbiased – jury in the world could examine carefully the evidence
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:26.920]   upon which the claims of Christianity rest, the result would be an undoubting conviction of their truth."
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   Jesus left enough evidence. If you would just search, if you are willing,
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   if you would just ask the right questions, and if you would search,
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   that you would come to this conclusion and conviction.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   But part of the reason why we remain kind of cloudy with our convictions,
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   for many of us, is because we're afraid of the conclusion that it's going to lead to.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   Because if Jesus really resurrected from the dead, and he is who he says he is,
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.920]   that the whole world is under the judgment of God,
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:04.920]   and that real life is coming when Jesus comes in glory,
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   nothing in this world matters.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   That's the logical conclusion, that we're on a boat that's going to go over the fall.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   And we're concerned about whether we're in first class or second class or third class,
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   whether we're going to have a good meal or not,
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   that we have a bucket list of what we want to experience on this boat before it goes over the cliff.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   That's what that means.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   But many people don't go that far. They'll ask questions,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   but they don't take the time to examine because they're concerned
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.920]   that if they come to the final conclusion that this is absolutely true,
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   the logical conclusion is what Paul did.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   The logical conclusion is what Peter did.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   The logical conclusion of the early Christians is as they are being burned at the stake,
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   crucified upside down, that they went to their graves saying, "No, this is true."
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   They were not special people.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.920]   They were just people who were convicted of this truth.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   So how much of our doubt is willful doubting?
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   We remain ignorant because we're afraid an absolutely convicted person
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   the conclusion of that, where that's going to lead me, I'm not willing.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   What if I am so convicted that this house that I'm trying to buy is just no longer necessary?
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   I'm trying so hard to take care of my kids, but in the light of eternity, it doesn't really matter.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   What if I get convicted? I'm going to sell everything and follow Christ.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   What if that's the natural conclusion?
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   But because we have committed to nominal Christianity, we will go as far as we can,
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   maintaining a comfortable, peaceful life while not denying Christ.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   And we willfully stay there.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.920]   Don't get me wrong. God did not call everybody to martyrdom.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   God did not call everybody out to the mission field.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   But how much of our skepticism is willful?
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.920]   Because we're afraid.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   We're afraid of the conclusion, where it's going to lead to.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   See, these skeptics don't sound as bad as the Pharisees.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   But they were just as sinful.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   They will be under the same judgment as the Pharisees.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Jesus' response in Luke 11, 17, 19, he says,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   "But he knew their thoughts and said to them, 'Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   and a house divided against itself, false.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.920]   For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out, so they will be your judges?'"
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   Now, the logical conclusion is, and he's just using deductive reasoning,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   "If I'm casting out demons by the power of Satan, how can that power stand?"
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   That's just logical. That doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   Why would Satan want to destroy his own house?
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   But the natural conclusion from this is Satan is not concerned about his own household.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   We're asked questions repeatedly, especially in the West.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   We travel around the world and we see persecution.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   We see Christians who are risking their lives just to get together.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   And we say, "How come we don't experience persecution?"
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   And when Jesus says, "Everyone who wants to live a godly life will be persecuted, but I'm not."
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   Why?
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   What if?
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   What if?
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.920]   The state of the church is exactly where Satan wants it to be.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.920]   What if the condition of the church is exactly where Satan wants the church to be?
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:30.920]   Because a lukewarm church does more damage for the witness of Christ than the atheists.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   I think you will testify from my experience, I've met more people who have left the church in bitterness.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Now, they will be accountable for their own faith.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   But I've met more people, far more people, who at one point knew something about the church.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   They said, "I don't want to be numbered among them."
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   So they walked away.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   Jesus says, "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me is scattered."
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.920]   There is no third category.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:11.920]   Either we are with him gathering, or we're part of the people that are scattering.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Why would Satan be concerned about lukewarm Christianity if lukewarm Christianity is doing more damage than the atheists?
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:30.920]   Why would Satan be concerned if the Hindus are coming and bashing the church, and that's bringing revival to the church?
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   Why would he do that here if the lives of his Christians are exactly where Satan wants us to be?
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   Let that sink in.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   Let that sink in, and I'm not saying every single individual is the same.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   But that's a common question that we ask, but we never really answer.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   Why, if Jesus said, "Anybody who wants to live a godly life will be persecuted," and we don't see any?
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   Why is it so easy?
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   What is this producing?
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:21.920]   And if you look at the cause of why these people are so hardened in their heart, it's simply self-preservation.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   Don't you and I struggle with that?
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   It's our self-preservation.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   We're willing to put up with all kinds of things, all kinds of doctrines, all kinds of people for self-preservation.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   We're bold when it doesn't cost us anything.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   We'll become timid if it somehow threatens us.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   And that's what caused them to be blind.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   He says Satan's not going to attack himself. That's ridiculous.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   And then he concludes by saying, in verse 20, "But I cast out demons by the finger of God."
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   Then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   And then he gives an illustration. He says, "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters."
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   He says, "By the finger of God."
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   They couldn't understand, like, clearly he has power, and they couldn't do anything with this demon-possessed man.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   And yet Jesus comes and says, "Get out," and he gets out, and it's done.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   And he says, basically he's saying, "I'm casting out demons by the finger of God."
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   Not fist of God, arm of God, power of God, just the finger of God. It's nothing.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.920]   It's nothing that what he is doing in light of who God is.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:04.920]   Can you imagine the restraint that Jesus had to show that with that flick he could have just flicked them?
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   How dare you? How dare you?
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   People died for lingering in the Holy of Holies.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.920]   People died for touching sacred things that belonged to him because it belonged to him.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   People died because they put up strange fires.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.920]   People died because they were in his presence. They couldn't even look at him.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   God had to protect Moses from just his back going passing, just a glimpse of him.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:49.920]   And that reflection of his glory scared the people to death, asked Moses to get in the tent.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   And these guys are standing in his presence calling him Satan.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   Imagine the restraint that Jesus must have practiced to not to flick them.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   It is incredible how blind and how offensive this statement is.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.920]   And yet Jesus restrains himself. He warns others.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.920]   There are no three categories.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.920]   He says either you are with me or you are against me.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   Which is it?
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:54.920]   He who wants to follow after me, he must deny himself and pick up his cross and follow me.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.920]   I pray that this encounter will be sobering to us.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   That we would not look upon the Pharisees and the skeptics and say that's not me.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   That would examine and come before the Lord and say search me and know me, see if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.920]   It's me. I'm my greatest hindrance.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   I'm my greatest blind spot.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.920]   It is my pride, it is my arrogance, it is my self-preservation that causes me to be blind.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.920]   Lord, open my eyes that I may see you as you are.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   That I may say, like Paul, that in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Christ, that everything else will become rubbish.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   Let's pray.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   Father, open our eyes that we may see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   That we may see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   Help us to live our lives for the eternal.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   For the precious souls, Lord God, that you have come to save.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   That we may be co-workers of Christ.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   That we may be the light and the salt that you called us to be.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   Lord, bring revival in our church, a revival in my life, revival in our generation.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   That for our inheritance that you would give us the lost.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:28.920]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.920]   What is our hope? What is our hope in life and death?
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.920]   Christ alone, Christ alone.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:49.920]   What is our only confidence? That our souls to Him belong.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   What holds our days within His hand? What comes apart from His command?
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   What will lead us to the end? The love of Christ in which we stand.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:23.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Our hope is free, is eternal.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:39.920]   Hallelujah, now and ever we profess. Christ, our hope in life and death.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.920]   What truth, what truth can call the troubled soul?
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:54.920]   God is good, God is good. Where is His grace and goodness known?
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:03.920]   In our brave Redeemer's blood. Who floods our faith when fears arise.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   Who stands above the stormy drought? Who sets the waves that bring us down?
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.920]   But to the shore, the rock of Christ.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Our hope is free, is eternal.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:36.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Now and ever we profess.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   Christ, our hope in life and death.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   Unto the grave, what will we see? Christ, He lives, Christ, He lives.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:06.920]   And what reward will heaven bring? Everlasting life within.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   There we will rise to meet the Lord. When sin and death will be destroyed.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   We will feast and end this role. When Christ is ours forevermore.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:37.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Our hope is free, is eternal.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:45.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Now and ever we profess.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.920]   Christ, our hope in life and death.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Our hope is free, is eternal.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   Oh, we'll sing hallelujah. Now and ever we profess.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   Christ, our hope in life and death.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   Now and ever we profess. Christ, our hope in life and death.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:29.920]   [music]
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   Let's pray. Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   eternal love of God the Father, rest, restore, strengthen all those who have been called
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.920]   according to your purpose, that we may live up to the gospel that we have been given.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:58.920]   May Christ's name be magnified. May the souls of the lost hear that there is hope in His name.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:05.920]   I pray that your children will live to shine your light brightly wherever you send us. Amen.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   [music]
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   God sent His Son. They called Him Jesus. He came to love. Heal and forgive. He lived and died.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   To buy my pardon, an empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:17:14.920]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:39.920]   Because I know He holds the future. And life is worth the living just because He lives. Amen.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   [music]
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:54.920]   [music]
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   What is our hope in life and death? Christ alone. What is our only confidence?
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   That our souls to Him belong. Who holds our days within His hand?
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:28.920]   What comes apart from His command? And what will keep us to the end?
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.920]   The love of Christ in which we stand.
