Just by way of taking care of some logistical items, I want to say a big thank you. A lot of you guys have signed up for our parking, volunteering, and also our setup and then our babysitting. So I want to extend just a real thank you to you guys for doing that.</p><p>For our Bible study, please note for those of you guys who are over in the overflow room, we're setting up at 6.30 and then after the study is over, we do have to collapse that and put the rows back for our cry room setup for Sunday, okay? And then finally, for those of you who are newer to church, I know we have a good amount of people who are newer to Berean, please note that our new membership course is going to be starting on October 2nd.</p><p>And you know that's an eight-week class that's going to cover all the philosophy of ministry, core doctrines of the church, and so please sign up for that and make sure you participate in that class. At this time, let's bow our heads, pray as we go into a time of singing praise and worship.</p><p>Heavenly Father, we truly do want to lift up our thanks to you. God, in this time, we want to make sure that we're expressing our heart of gratitude in light of our belief that you have granted to us so much in your Son. And again, even though we do this week to week, we're grateful, Lord, and we want to come with such appreciative hearts knowing that to be able to fellowship over your word, to be able to share our convictions, all this is grace and privilege to us.</p><p>And God, I pray that we would then continue just to apply ourselves to the study and learning of your word. And what's more, we just pray that your Spirit will cause our minds, our hearts to overflow with response of faith, response of desire to change, and ultimately grow to the stature of Christ.</p><p>We thank you. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. All right. Please stay seated as we enter into a time of praise. The love of God. The love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell.</p><p>A guilty pair, out town with care, God gave his Son to win. His erring child he reconciled and fought in front of his Son. When years of time, when years of time shall pass away, and earthly throes and kingdoms fall, when men who hear refuse to pray, on rocks and hills and mountains cold, God's love so sure shall still endure.</p><p>A measureless and strong, redeeming grace to Adam's race, the saints and angels sung. Could we with it. Could we with it. The ocean fill and were the skies of parchment made, where every stock on earth the quail and every man a scribe by trade. And to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry.</p><p>Nor could the scroll contain the whole, no stress from sky to sky. Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong. It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels sung. Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong. It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels sung.</p><p>All that I am. All that I am. All that I have. I lay them down before you, oh Lord. All my regrets. All my acclaim. The joy and the pain. I'm making them yours. Lord, I offer my life to you. Everything I've been through. Use it for your glory.</p><p>Lord, I offer my days to you. Lifting my praise to you as a pleasing sacrifice. Lord, I offer you my life. Things in the past. Things yet unseen. Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true. All of my hopes. All of my plans. My heart and my hands.</p><p>I lift it to you. Lord, I offer my life to you. Everything I've been through. Use it for your glory. Lord, I offer my days to you. Lifting my praise to you as a pleasing sacrifice. Lord, I offer you my life. Lord, I offer my life to you. Everything I've been through.</p><p>Use it for your glory. Lord, I offer my days to you. Lifting my praise to you as a pleasing sacrifice. Lord, I offer you my life. Okay, at this time within your groups, please go ahead and dive right into your shared observations, questions, and going through the text. And then after some time, about 45 minutes or so, Pastor Peter Kim will come back up to give the lesson for today.</p><p>Thank you, everyone.</p></div></body></html>
