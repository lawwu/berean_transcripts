href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=97s">00:01:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So our study this evening in chapter 15 is divided into three parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=103s">00:01:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a heavenly sign, heavenly singers and heavenly temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=108s">00:01:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how your worksheet has been divided into three parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=111s">00:01:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first part is just verse one and verse one is kind of an introduction to what's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=117s">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in verses two through verse eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=119s">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second scene, the heavenly singing is a vision of worship and is a very typical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=125s">00:02:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">scene that we've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=126s">00:02:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mentioned I think last week that various parts of the book of revelations up to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=131s">00:02:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">point where there's intense judgment and then there's a break to kind of give a glimpse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=135s">00:02:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=136s">00:02:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And whenever they see this glimpse of heaven, they see worship taking place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=138s">00:02:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the second scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=140s">00:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third scene is the preparation before the angels are sent out and judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=144s">00:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is poured out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=145s">00:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So God gives John a glimpse of the temple and the preparation that's taking place before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=152s">00:02:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're sent out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=153s">00:02:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=154s">00:02:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the three scenes that we're going to be looking at today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=155s">00:02:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one, which we see in verse one, the heavenly sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=163s">00:02:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so first of all, a sign is not the reality, but something that points to reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=170s">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is something that we may or may not know, but when we, when all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=175s">00:02:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've been studying in the scripture, especially as we've been looking at the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=179s">00:02:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of revelation that mentions various signs and each one of these signs, basically it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=186s">00:03:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to point to something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=189s">00:03:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">As an example, if you're driving on a highway long distance and you see a sign that says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=194s">00:03:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that shows you a picture of a gas station or a hotel or whatever it may be, that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=199s">00:03:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a sign that there's a city coming down the street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=202s">00:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=203s">00:03:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're to look for the exit, you have to look for whatever is coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=207s">00:03:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole purpose of the sign is to prepare you to point to something that is coming in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=212s">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=213s">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it starts out by saying, this is a sign, a great sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=218s">00:03:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pointing to a great reality that's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=220s">00:03:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=221s">00:03:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesus used that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=222s">00:03:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let me, let me go through this first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=226s">00:03:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">For international standard Bible encyclopedia, the literal understanding of it is a mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=232s">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">by which persons or things are distinguished or to made known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=236s">00:03:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=237s">00:03:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It is something that points to something greater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=241s">00:04:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesus oftentimes performed signs, he says, to show them who he was, that he is the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=248s">00:04:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The apostles, their works were accompanied by signs and miracles to point to the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=253s">00:04:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that they were specifically chosen by God to take the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=257s">00:04:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it says there's a sign, it's to point to something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=260s">00:04:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're seeing is not the reality in itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a point to something that's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=266s">00:04:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=267s">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I mentioned that Jesus performed many miracles, a sign to point to his identity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=273s">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=277s">00:04:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So what John saw was not the reality, but the pointing to the reality that's about to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=281s">00:04:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">take place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=284s">00:04:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And because this is the last sign of the last stage of God's wrath, it's described as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=288s">00:04:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">great and amazing sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=291s">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So three separate places where in the book of Revelation where it says there's a sign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=298s">00:04:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's taking place, and it's in chapter five, oh no, sorry, chapter 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=304s">00:05:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first sign, it was a sign of the woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=307s">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=308s">00:05:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember when the woman gives birth to a son, and then the beast comes and tries to destroy</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/237136859#t=318s">00:05:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second sign, if you guys remember, was the beast himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
