I'm going to pray in the name of Jesus, and I'm going to ask God to give me the strength. I'm going to ask God to give me the strength to understand. God, help me. The prayers I've been praying for are just for my children, that they understand the depth of their sin, and the beauty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that they would acknowledge, and worship God.</p><p>My prayer is that their hearts may be softened, and that their eyes may be enlightened by the Word of God. That's what I've been praying for. The most important thing that I pray for is for the salvation of my children. I would be seeking for the disciples in Kilian, that they may know God and worship Him.</p><p>The second thing I pray for is that I could be a wise and loving and patient person, and that they would be able to understand the depth of their sin, and that they would be able to understand the beauty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that they would be able to understand the depth of their sin.</p><p>I pray for the salvation of my children.
