as I mentioned before, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=56s">00:00:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">goal of this study is to get you to

we talked about that last week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=68s">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the context.</span></div><div

the text that they're quoting, you're going to see it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=91s">00:01:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=103s">00:01:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a logical connection from one section of the scripture to the next, just like if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=106s">00:01:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you're reading any letter, you wouldn't start in the middle, you wouldn't start at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=110s">00:01:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you would read it

book in order to determine the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=115s">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of the particular words or passages in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=118s">00:01:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the first things I ask you to do is to know the four chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=124s">00:02:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm assuming 100% of you did that

into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=135s">00:02:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">verses three to eight, and where does this fit in into his larger letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=141s">00:02:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't want to just go in there and then interpret a particular verse or a word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=145s">00:02:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of the larger context of what he's trying to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=149s">00:02:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=150s">00:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I asked you, like we outlined chapter one, to take some time to outline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=154s">00:02:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter two, three, and four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=155s">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you haven't done that, I want to encourage you as a homework to go back this week and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=160s">00:02:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">outline the text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=161s">00:02:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to give you the general outline for the sake of time, but that's not enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=166s">00:02:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to know the outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=167s">00:02:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just take an outline that I give you and say, "Oh, that's what it says."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=171s">00:02:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a world of difference in the way that you're going to understand the text if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=174s">00:02:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">already know what he is saying instead of just regurgitating what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=179s">00:02:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So each word must be understood within the context of the verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=184s">00:03:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you interpret love, servant, grace, outside of the context of what Paul meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=193s">00:03:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and what he meant within the context of that letter and that verse, again, that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=198s">00:03:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">misinterpretation comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=199s">00:03:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Each verse must be understood within the context of the paragraph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=204s">00:03:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you need to know the word in the context of the verse, the verse in the context of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=208s">00:03:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the paragraph, paragraph in the context of the chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=212s">00:03:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So verses three to eight that we're looking at, Paul is giving thanks in his introduction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=217s">00:03:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he's talking about prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=219s">00:03:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Where does this fit in, into the larger context?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=222s">00:03:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then each chapter must be understood within the context of the book, this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=228s">00:03:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is Paul's main point in

read and the outline that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=237s">00:03:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">give, if you were to give like one sentence statement of why Paul wrote this letter, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=243s">00:04:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is the main thrust of this letter, what would you say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=248s">00:04:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Please yell it out if you have an opinion on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=259s">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=264s">00:04:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have anything similar to that, that's probably, if you've read through it and outlined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=268s">00:04:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it, that's probably the essential theme that is

href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1829s">00:30:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then by the time I went through about two or three passages like that, I started</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1838s">00:30:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then afterwards, I went to read the commentaries just to compare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1843s">00:30:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I realized was that everything that the insight I got, it was in the commentary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1849s">00:30:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just kind of confirms, like, okay, this isn't

wasn't because they knew Greek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1872s">00:31:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't because they had this,

want you to go through inductive Bible study, because I want you to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/312455963#t=1892s">00:31:32.440</a></span> | <span
