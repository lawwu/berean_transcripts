Let me begin by welcoming those who are coming into town because of school starting. I know this is a welcome week. And so we have a welcome table stationed outside. As you were coming in, you probably saw a canopy and a bunch of tables that are set up, especially if you are coming in and you want some information about our college department, meet some of our staff here.</p><p>If you go to that table outside, they'll give you all the information that you need and give you the various schedules, things that are going on. There's a lot of stuff going on, especially with the college ministry this week. So please go to that table and they'll give you the information that you need.</p><p>Our membership class, our next round of membership class is starting on September 29th, which is next Sunday at 9.30. It's an eight-week course. And if you desire to be a member of the church, please sign up for that. And they'll give you directions on what's gonna happen. Again, this is happening during this service at 9.30 across the courtyard in our youth group room, okay?</p><p>So please sign up for that if you are planning to do that. And then our regional Thanksgiving dinner, they have about 25 people who have already signed up. They said they need another about 20 to 25 people to sign up. If you are interested in hosting, then serving the church in that way, there is a table outside.</p><p>And again, this is not for the regular sign up for just to participate. But if you're willing to host and you can fit maybe about 20, 25 people in your house, that's happening again on November 24th at 5 p.m. But if you're able to host and you're willing to do that, that sign up is on the courtyard.</p><p>As you're going out, you'll meet the table and you can sign up there, okay? If you are at the age of 50 or over, okay, so part of the Jubilee Ministry, on October 12th at 8.30, which is a Saturday in the cafe, we're gonna be having a prayer breakfast.</p><p>So all those who are 50 and over, part of the Jubilee Ministry. And a fee for that is gonna be $10 for breakfast. So please sign up for that as well. And then lastly, our Volunteers for Reformation Night, which is happening on October 31st at 4.30 p.m. So if you're willing to come and set up or even help clean up or run some of the games, please sign up.</p><p>And I think that sign up for that is also at the table outside. So if you go outside and just let them know that you wanna volunteer, they'll give you directions and the meetings that are gonna come from that, okay? All right, I think that's all we have for this morning.</p><p>Let me pray for us and give you an opportunity to give online. And again, if you brought a physical offering, we have a box in the back on the way out. You can visit that box on the way out, all right? Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace.</p><p>We pray, Father God, that we would never give into just a routine or a habit, but that the worship that we give you from our hearts will be an overflow of the great work that you are doing in us. Help us to recognize what it is that we have been given in Christ, that our worship truly would be genuine, an overflow of gratitude.</p><p>I pray this morning that you would help us not to be entangled with the things of this world, whatever we have brought into this room, that you would help us to focus our attention on Christ and his word. And I pray that even in this giving that we would give as an act of worship and maybe multiply 30, 60, a hundredfold for the sake of your name.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. (gentle music) (pages flipping) (gentle music) (pages flipping) (gentle music) (pages flipping) Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments just to greet the neighbors around us.
