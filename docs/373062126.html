class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=158s">00:02:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">As I look at this passage, there is a strong, emphatic command in verse one, saying, "Therefore,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=165s">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=176s">00:02:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in verse two and three, Paul calls for the harmony between these two ladies.</span></div><div

rapid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=186s">00:03:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">fire commandments that come at you.</span></div><div

commands of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=204s">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=205s">00:03:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, yes, although the emphatic command is "Stand firm," I saw that there was quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=210s">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a theme related to peace, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=214s">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, verse eight through nine, he gives two commands, which is dwell on these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=221s">00:03:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and practice these things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=224s">00:03:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, outlines aren't set in stone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=229s">00:03:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't "Thus says the Lord, thou shalt outline my verse this way."</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=239s">00:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes, it forces you to read and reread the passage over and over, and then just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=243s">00:04:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think like, "What is this train of thought here?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=246s">00:04:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=247s">00:04:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as an introductory remark, there's like way too much stuff to cover in today's lesson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/373062126#t=254s">00:04:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I set the major outline of the book in terms of my teaching outline for this
