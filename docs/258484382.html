href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=0s">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, so hopefully you guys had some time to look through these passages and I'm sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=7s">00:00:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you've noticed there's a lot of similarities to the sin offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=13s">00:00:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about how, what the sin offering meant last week and one of the key factors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=22s">00:00:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sin offering is to detail how God views sin and that not all sins were treated equally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=29s">00:00:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had the sin of the high priest, the sin of the community, sin of a leader or sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=33s">00:00:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of a regular congregation member and how the offering in each one of them were different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=39s">00:00:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was a distinction between an intentional and an unintentional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=45s">00:00:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And intentional we looked at last week where it was a willful rebellion against God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=48s">00:00:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Even something as small as breaking the Sabbath in our view may not seem like a big deal but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=54s">00:00:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in God's view it was very clearly stated how important Sabbath was and for someone to break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=59s">00:00:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that was basically a willful rebellion against God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=63s">00:01:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so sin offering kind of revealed all of that, it went through the intricate details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=68s">00:01:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This week's offering, the guilt offering, again in many ways it is very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=73s">00:01:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to give us another aspect and detail of how God views sin and how again the penalty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=81s">00:01:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of sin and how God in their repentance would restore whatever it was that was broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=88s">00:01:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we jump right into it, guilt offering in other places or oftentimes it would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=98s">00:01:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">called trespass offering or reparation offering and so there's about four or five different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=103s">00:01:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">names and all of them basically means the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=108s">00:01:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a different aspect of the sin offering but it specifically deals with trespass, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=113s">00:01:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something was done against something or someone, that this was not a private sin, this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=118s">00:01:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not a sin simply your rebellion against God but it affected other people, other people's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=124s">00:02:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">property or something that you've done and so that's why it's called a trespass offering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=129s">00:02:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you trespass against somebody else or a reparation offering because it required a reparation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=135s">00:02:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a pay of whatever it was that was broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A ram or male lamb without defect was the exclusive animals required for this offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=146s">00:02:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">All other offerings had different options for the type of animals used but this offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=150s">00:02:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">was limited to these two particular animals, at least that's what we see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=155s">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think that's the case?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=158s">00:02:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If you had some time to look through these passages and you try to understand what he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=163s">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">required in this offering, why do you think that God didn't give them any options?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=170s">00:02:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about the intention of this offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=179s">00:02:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to say anything, I just want you to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=182s">00:03:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know maybe some of you guys already asked that question before you came.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=187s">00:03:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Why in every other offering God gave different offerings that they could give, right, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=194s">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">give this one or that one and based upon you know your wealth and what you couldn't or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=198s">00:03:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">could or couldn't afford, you know, male lamb or female lamb but this one is very specific,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=203s">00:03:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it was just this animal and that was it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=215s">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't spell out why but we can understand why God wouldn't give them all these options</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=220s">00:03:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because the point of this offering wasn't the lamb itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=225s">00:03:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The point of this offering was reparation, is to pay back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=229s">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=231s">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the goal of this offering was to repay back whatever it was that you defiled, whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=236s">00:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you did against somebody else and to add on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=241s">00:04:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though the offering was given, the main point of this was reparation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=246s">00:04:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's probably the main reason why there wasn't all these different alternatives in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=252s">00:04:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">giving the offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=255s">00:04:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a specific monetary compensation involved in this offering for the restitution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=261s">00:04:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of damage committed by the sinner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=265s">00:04:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to kind of give you, again I want to go over this, after making the guilt offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=269s">00:04:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with the ram or lamb, it was required from the offender to add a fifth of the value to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=273s">00:04:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">give to the priest first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=276s">00:04:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why, again, the idea is trespassing, reparation, and to pay back whatever it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=281s">00:04:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that you defiled and then on top of that, add 20%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=287s">00:04:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why it's 20%, at that particular time, 20% was a typical interest rate on all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=294s">00:04:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">loans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=295s">00:04:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was, today, you know, we have different interest rates, like we have home loans, right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=299s">00:04:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">now I think it's about 4.3, so if you happen to live in California, that's about what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=303s">00:05:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would pay, everybody would pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=305s">00:05:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Car loans are different, you know, student loans are different, but at that particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=309s">00:05:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time it was well understood that if you gave a loan to somebody, that you would, they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=315s">00:05:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have an understanding that 20% would be given back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=318s">00:05:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this 20% basically represented that whatever it was that you took, that you were kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=323s">00:05:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">giving back with interest, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=326s">00:05:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost as if you took it for a loan and then you're paying them back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=329s">00:05:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this offering is unique in that there was, there's no other animals that was, choices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=338s">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that was given, it was specifically those particular animals and there was a compensation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=344s">00:05:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=345s">00:05:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There was actually money being exchanged in this offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=349s">00:05:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So like all the other offerings, you would bring the animal to the priest and they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=356s">00:05:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">see if it was acceptable, then after they received that it was acceptable, the priest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=362s">00:06:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would take it and then the restitution would be made to the offended party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=369s">00:06:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not spelled out here, but numbers 5, 5 through 10, it says if the offended party</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=373s">00:06:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't available to receive the property or money, the nearest relative who was available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=377s">00:06:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">was paid instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=380s">00:06:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are some of the unique qualities of this particular offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=384s">00:06:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of it is very similar to the sin offering, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=388s">00:06:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's like two or three things that are very unique to them, but the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=391s">00:06:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">unique part of this particular offering was the compensation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=398s">00:06:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what this offering, and we're going to talk about this later, what this offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=401s">00:06:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">basically taught was that when your sin caused damage to someone else's property, God required</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=409s">00:06:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that not only that you come before God and say, "Oh, I'm sorry," and then, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=412s">00:06:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">me and God, we're okay," but it was required to pay back, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=417s">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">To pay reparation and restore whatever damage that you've committed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=423s">00:07:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the teaching on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=424s">00:07:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember last week's, the sin offering taught that there's different degrees of sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=430s">00:07:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=431s">00:07:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was the main teaching on that sin offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=434s">00:07:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">This one, that even though you may have sinned against God, damage that was done had to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=440s">00:07:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">paid back, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=441s">00:07:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the main point of this particular offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=446s">00:07:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason given that is required for this offering is twofold, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=453s">00:07:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the large category one, and the second one I'll get to in a minute, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=457s">00:07:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">first category is when the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3253s">00:54:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that balance is a challenge even in the church where you kind of like, well, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3258s">00:54:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">want to be gracious, and we want people to feel safe where they can confess their sins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3262s">00:54:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and the next thing you know, everybody's like, well, you're a sinner, I'm a sinner, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3266s">00:54:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you create an environment where sin is okay because everybody's sinning together, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3271s">00:54:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you go to the other extreme where you put fear and trembling that we're watching, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3275s">00:54:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly asking each other, are you sinning, are you doing this, are you doing that, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3285s">00:54:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a constant challenge because we always tend to err one way or the other, or you kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3291s">00:54:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of gravitate one toward the other, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3294s">00:54:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can't ignore either, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3297s">00:54:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Because God is holy and God is love at the same time all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3301s">00:55:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a time when, okay, we're not going to talk about holiness now because we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3305s">00:55:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to focus on God's love, or we're going to focus on His

we do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3316s">00:55:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, how do we balance that, right, without neglecting the other?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3321s">00:55:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Four, do you have a tendency to keep sin private or do you regularly confess your sins to others</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3325s">00:55:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">asking for accountability?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3327s">00:55:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you know, we can easily hold things back, right, and just keep it to ourselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3333s">00:55:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but when we do that, the sin tends to fester and it becomes bigger, right, as we saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3339s">00:55:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so God always gives opportunity for us to, that's why the scripture says in James</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3342s">00:55:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to confess your sins to one another, right, to bring it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3346s">00:55:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we bring it out, it has a lesser impact, but if we are waiting for it to get exposed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3351s">00:55:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we get humiliated and the damage is much bigger, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3355s">00:55:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, that question is, is there a pattern in your life where you're willing to confess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3361s">00:56:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when there is sin in your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3363s">00:56:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, again, question number four, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/258484382#t=3365s">00:56:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into
