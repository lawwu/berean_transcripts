actually hitting and running bases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/271209114#t=171s">00:02:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and getting legitimate

might be able to win a game, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/271209114#t=179s">00:02:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one day.</span></div><div

with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/271209114#t=196s">00:03:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">our brothers and sisters in Christ.</span></div><div
