href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=171s">00:02:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=172s">00:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There isn't necessarily a specific exhortation of thou must do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=177s">00:02:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But nevertheless there is a desire of the author Apostle Paul that he wants to be

more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=192s">00:03:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so expressing what we want for them in life.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=202s">00:03:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants them to be informed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

emphasize for you what I would like to boil down this review</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=252s">00:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as to one theme that I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=255s">00:04:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the theme?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/442520967#t=257s">00:04:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the running ongoing content that has been the pattern of Apostle Paul's
