back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=9s">00:00:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Saturday and Pastor Mark gave a sermon and he gave his update, but we asked if we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=14s">00:00:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">have a couple people from the China team to give us an update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=18s">00:00:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well this morning everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=21s">00:00:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so my name is Jeremy and I was part of the missions team that went out to China</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=29s">00:00:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and we just got back this past Saturday, so it's been about a week now since we got back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=35s">00:00:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but God really used this trip to open my eyes and to teach me a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=42s">00:00:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I just wanted to share a couple things that God taught me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=45s">00:00:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So over the past two and a half weeks we had a lot of opportunities to be able to hang</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=52s">00:00:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out with the students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=54s">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had about a hundred students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=56s">00:00:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There were about 90 women and 10 guys, so we got to know the guys pretty well and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=63s">00:01:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the camp during break times, during meals, and during dorm visits we got to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=68s">00:01:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to them a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=70s">00:01:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think as we interacted with the students, God broke my heart a little bit for the students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=81s">00:01:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the people were living out their lives just like we do here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=87s">00:01:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're pursuing their goals and they just, you know, a lot of them have been through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=94s">00:01:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">rough experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=95s">00:01:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked to a lot of people that faced depression and even had thoughts about suicide and stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=102s">00:01:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=103s">00:01:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also met people that were a lot older, like in their 50s and stuff, but you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=111s">00:01:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you could tell that they kind of were looking for something more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=115s">00:01:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as I met these people, I felt like I really connected with them and I could relate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=119s">00:01:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot with them, at least personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=122s">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And God broke my heart for these people because they didn't have the gospel and they didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=127s">00:02:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know who Jesus was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=129s">00:02:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were pursuing the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=134s">00:02:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And at least personally, you know, like, you know, like it hurts me to see that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=142s">00:02:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the end, like none of those things really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=144s">00:02:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So something that we questioned a lot with them was, you know, is that all there is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=151s">00:02:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">life, you know, just pursuing your job, getting a good education and stuff, studying hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=156s">00:02:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for the students that are in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=158s">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it made me open my eyes to see the need of the gospel there, which was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=164s">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something that is kind of hard to see sometimes back at home just because I'm so caught up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=169s">00:02:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in like what I'm doing here and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=174s">00:02:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that challenged me, we did actually a devotion from John 4, 37 to 38.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=179s">00:02:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "For here the saying holds true, one sows and another reaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=183s">00:03:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=186s">00:03:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Others have labored and you have entered into their labor."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=191s">00:03:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Going out for two and a half weeks, it was kind of, I didn't really know what to expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=195s">00:03:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I didn't know, I kind of had doubts on how effective we would be just being there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=201s">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for two weeks because in the past two weeks, we got close to the students, but, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=208s">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't a lot of time with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=210s">00:03:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think this passage really showed that although we were only there for a short</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=216s">00:03:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time, that we were really able to make an impact on the students just by showing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=221s">00:03:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">love and just by, you know, talking to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=225s">00:03:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that all the students told us was that, like, they all knew that we were Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=229s">00:03:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that one thing that they were constantly saying is like, "Wow, like you Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=234s">00:03:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are like genuinely loving people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=236s">00:03:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think just that alone was able to make an impact on them and be able to like help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=242s">00:04:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">them think about, you know, our message to them more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=248s">00:04:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so God taught me that he can use anyone and anything to make his gospel known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=253s">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been learning about it in Romans a lot that although we're weak vessels, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=257s">00:04:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">uses us not by our own strength, but just according to his perfect plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=264s">00:04:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that kind of motivated me even coming back home that, you know, anything that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=271s">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do, you know, can make a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=276s">00:04:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes I don't try because I feel like, "Oh, what's the point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=279s">00:04:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to make a difference."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=281s">00:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But God taught me that even just by showing someone compassion and just really reaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=288s">00:04:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">out to someone can really make a big impact because you never know what someone's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=292s">00:04:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">through in their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are two things that God taught me during this mission trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=300s">00:05:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say if you guys could pray for the students that we met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=305s">00:05:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of our team has made connections with the students there that they're still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=311s">00:05:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping in contact with right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=313s">00:05:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So just pray that God would use like messaging as an avenue to continue to reach out to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=320s">00:05:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=321s">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They're asking a lot of questions and they're really interested, but just pray that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=325s">00:05:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">would open their eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=326s">00:05:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

added</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=374s">00:06:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on as an optional session at the end of the day, despite

a good handful of them still came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=385s">00:06:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were very thankful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=387s">00:06:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">A little background, Pastor Alex was a pastor here and he moved out to China a couple years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=392s">00:06:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ago.</span></div><div

really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=398s">00:06:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thankful that I got to get to know him and be able to serve

topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=407s">00:06:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So our topics were culture shock, baseball, dating and

practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=418s">00:06:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=419s">00:06:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us it was used as an opportunity to share the gospel with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=425s">00:07:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So during these times God made a few things really clear to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=429s">00:07:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing was that God is going to move and work regardless of my efforts or sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=435s">00:07:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the lack thereof of my efforts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=438s">00:07:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">By the end of the day we were all really exhausted and there were times when I just wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=442s">00:07:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">zone out or just sit there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=444s">00:07:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there was one night towards the end where Joyce and I had to sit through eight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=449s">00:07:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">nine hours of speeches, which was really long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=453s">00:07:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, even when I wanted to just sit and not really have a conversation about God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=458s">00:07:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the Holy Spirit still moves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=459s">00:07:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And those nights they asked so many more questions that we didn't even instigate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=464s">00:07:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Jeremy shared, a lot of them, all of them knew that we were Christians and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=467s">00:07:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">were really amazed that we would just come and pay for our trip to China to help them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=472s">00:07:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a really good way to really start talking about the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=477s">00:07:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And second, God's work in my life is undeniable and unavoidable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=483s">00:08:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the same way, whenever we were sharing, even if I didn't want to talk about God, He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=488s">00:08:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just came out anyways because I realized that all of my life decisions and my actions were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=493s">00:08:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">based on my faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=495s">00:08:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore I couldn't share anything about myself or my thoughts on any topic without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=500s">00:08:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just going back to the gospel and without sharing my faith with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=506s">00:08:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And last, God uses me as a vessel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=510s">00:08:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He's the one who worked in me and therefore He will work in the students' hearts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=514s">00:08:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was personally able to find a way to sneak in the gospel like once every day during those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=520s">00:08:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">English Corners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=521s">00:08:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you multiply that by 10 and then every night, we were able to share a lot and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=525s">00:08:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of good conversations that came about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=529s">00:08:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And Joyce and I personally had really good opportunities sharing with some of the sisters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=534s">00:08:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the students named Felix and we were able to share a lot with her and she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=539s">00:08:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">had a lot of really good questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=540s">00:09:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So she was one of the students that we gave a Bible to at the end and thankfully she goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=544s">00:09:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to school really close to Pastor Alex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=547s">00:09:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So she's interested in going to his Bible studies and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=550s">00:09:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something we're really thankful for and we hope and pray that she'll continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=554s">00:09:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to be there if we ever go back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=557s">00:09:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but with that said, a lot of us were also really sad that we couldn't connect the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=563s">00:09:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">students with any community or church or friends back where they were at because they came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=568s">00:09:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from all over China, not just Beijing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=572s">00:09:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, it was easy to feel hopeless or wonder if they would ever even think about the conversations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=577s">00:09:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=578s">00:09:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There was like nights where Joyce and I would stay there until 11 o'clock just sharing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=582s">00:09:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who God is and like answering their questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=585s">00:09:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I've been reflecting on the trip and myself, I realized that that same principle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=589s">00:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could technically be applied to me or any of us here that, you know, God didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=595s">00:09:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to work in our heart, but he did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=597s">00:09:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the same way he's going to work in their heart, whether or not they have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=600s">00:10:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">community or not, God's going to work in his own way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=603s">00:10:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that gave me a lot of hope and assurance in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=606s">00:10:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I just wanted to end with a couple of prayer requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=611s">00:10:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, a big thing, I think, like I just said, there's a lot of people who want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=615s">00:10:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to know about the gospel, but there's not enough people sharing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=619s">00:10:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, China really needs more workers and more people to share and serve and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=624s">00:10:24.040</a></span> | <span

lot of the Christians that we encountered out of the students, they struggled a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=633s">00:10:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with kind of just thinking of God as someone who helps them in times of need and kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=639s">00:10:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=640s">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we asked them more questions, it got them thinking, but they definitely, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=645s">00:10:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">need more just people to guide them and help them live out their Christian lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=652s">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For Pastor Alex, continual endurance, family's physical and spiritual strength, and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=660s">00:11:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more workers because, yeah, just praying that Pastor Alex will have genuine brothers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=665s">00:11:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sisters that he could serve and just be encouraged by and encouraged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=670s">00:11:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, yeah, it's hard when you're out there alone, even though he does have his family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=676s">00:11:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so keeping that in your prayers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=679s">00:11:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, those that we reached out to and those that Pastor Alex is still reaching</span></div><div

things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/231755587#t=688s">00:11:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they've been holding on to and really give their lives
