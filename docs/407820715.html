href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=135s">00:02:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As we look at this passage, there is a strong prayer here for every single believer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=142s">00:02:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we wanted to do first is take a look at one of the study questions was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=148s">00:02:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what prompted the prayer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=150s">00:02:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul in a couple of occasions said, "For this reason," and so we have to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=155s">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what was this reason?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=159s">00:02:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we notice is actually that this phrase, "For this reason," occurred in verse 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=166s">00:02:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul said, "For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=171s">00:02:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of you Gentiles," and then he paused in that moment, and when he paused, he paused to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=178s">00:02:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us the question, "Did you really understand the gospel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=182s">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you understand what God is doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=184s">00:03:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And do you understand why I'm trying to make sure I teach you these things?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=188s">00:03:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he picks back up his thought in verse 14 and says, "For this reason I bow my knees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=194s">00:03:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=198s">00:03:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as we take a look at this, we wrestle with Apostle Paul's thought whenever we study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=209s">00:03:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible because in a very methodical and I would say an intricate way, he strings together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=217s">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">many thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=218s">00:03:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm going to say is, Apostle Paul then has been saying that leading up to this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=224s">00:03:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a rationale, a motive as to why he is praying this for the church, for the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=231s">00:03:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things I just want to quickly mention is, every single one of us, at some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=235s">00:03:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">seasons we can wrestle in prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=237s">00:03:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some seasons, because of certain needs, we are fervent in prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=241s">00:04:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Other seasons, we struggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=244s">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps it's difficult to pray, namely because prayer in and of itself is a difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=249s">00:04:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline, and sometimes it's difficult to pray because maybe we've experienced disappointment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=255s">00:04:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes, it's difficult for us to pray, we struggle with it, because we're not reminded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=262s">00:04:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as to the grand purpose as to why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=265s">00:04:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if we were more encouraged as to the reason why we pray, then perhaps more so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=269s">00:04:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would pray all the more regularly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=271s">00:04:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, as we think about this, I have a couple questions for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=275s">00:04:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Could it be questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=276s">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the possible rationales as to why Apostle Paul is praying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=280s">00:04:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the reason that he is talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=282s">00:04:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Could it be that in verse 13, in our previous section, Apostle Paul mentioned that he wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=289s">00:04:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to encourage the church because he doesn't want them to be disheartened by his tribulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=294s">00:04:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically the fact that he's in jail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=297s">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you think about this, Apostle Paul perhaps could be saying, "I really want you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=300s">00:05:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand that God does love you, and although with your eyes you see persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=305s">00:05:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">coming, you see me in jail, although all this horrible stuff is happening, trust me, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=310s">00:05:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really loves you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=311s">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to know that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=313s">00:05:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are some people, some commentators, who think that Apostle Paul is pointing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=318s">00:05:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that the church may be discouraged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=321s">00:05:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us, if we received something of an exhortation, like "Follow me as I follow Christ,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=326s">00:05:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or "Obey what I say, but the person who's speaking to you is in jail," it could be disheartening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=331s">00:05:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As a matter of fact, it could lend to a little bit of suspicion, like, "What's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=335s">00:05:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">happening?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=336s">00:05:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=337s">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I don't think this is the case, namely because when Apostle Paul states this reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=344s">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he goes above and beyond that parenthetical section in verses 12 to 13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=348s">00:05:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sorry, verses 2 to 13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=350s">00:05:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather, he says, "For this reason," at the beginning of the chapter, pointing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=353s">00:05:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=354s">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">A second potential is Paul's love for the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=359s">00:05:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If we're looking at chapter 2, we recall that the church as it's being built, Apostle Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=365s">00:06:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in his description of the gospel in chapter 2 moved from personal salvation, moving from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=369s">00:06:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">death to life, to what that means as a ramification, that we all are made one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=375s">00:06:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That the dividing walls of animosity and enmity has been done away with, and so the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=380s">00:06:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=381s">00:06:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And we described how God loves that church as its own household, and therefore, Apostle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=386s">00:06:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, he essentially depicts in many ways his own love for the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=389s">00:06:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So is his love for the church the reason why he's praying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=393s">00:06:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Could be.</span></div><div

be said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/407820715#t=398s">00:06:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
