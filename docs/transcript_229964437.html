They traveled again to continue God's great commission to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth. (children chattering) - Are we lost? - We're not lost. - This looks like a moon. - But we're not lost. I know exactly where we are and we're not lost. - Hey, look at us, that means we're directions. - We're not lost. - Can you tell us how to get to Mars? We need directions. (chomping) We're trying to get to Mars. Can you help us? (chomping) - I'm Cork and this is Spork. Can you tell us where Mars is? (chomping) - You already said that. (chomping) - Let's just go this way. - Okay, fine. (chomping) (dramatic music) (cheering) - Hey, I never wanted to know who I am if my computer was this size. Those four, they're only gonna fall through my trap once again. - Hey, let's go stop Annie. - Okay. - Shh. - Wow, she's so pretty. - I know, like look right there. - Wow, and she even has earrings. (laughing) And does she have a mustache? She kind of has a manly face. (laughing) She's so pretty. Anyway, can you give us the directions to Mars? - Of course I can give you directions to Mars. Come here, this way, this way, this way. This way, this way, here, let me show you. All you have to do is come right here and-- (screaming) - I can't believe they fell through my pipe once again, you fools. I mean, I can't blame you though. I am pretty gorgeous. You fools, you better wait. I'm gonna come back and get you and do evil things. - What happened? - I think I hit the computer. - Oh no, we can't get out. How are we gonna get out of this theater? - Don't worry, we'll find a way out somehow. How, somehow? - Why did this have to happen to us? Why us? Hey! - Don't worry, God has a plan for us and we just need to trust in him. - You're right, we need to trust in God. What should we do? - I'm going to pray. God, please help us to remember that you have a plan for us and that you love us. Thank you for sending your son to save us. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. - Amen. - I am cursed. - What? - What? - What? - I'm cursed. - Whoa, we're out. - Yeah. - I'm cursed. - Yeah. - Help me with that. - Quick, let's get back to the ship before Nemesis finds us. - Okay, let's go. - Oh look, there's a message on the screen. We should play it. (computer beeps) - Captain, entering message. - Captain. - Captain Quint and Quint, we are on mission right now in China, and our people are in extreme danger. We need you to continue to work for the Great Commission. Come back to China, that people need you. And we hope that everyone, all the audience will join us in the work of the Great Commission. It's up to you. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, where did they go? Did you guys have anything to do with that? (audience cheers) Quint and Squirtle, where are they? Hey, you three, did you have anything to do with this? Drama. No, okay, Groots, my name is Nemesis of Genesis, not like my twin brother Andrew over there, but, Groots, I'm asking you, where is Captain Quint and Squirtle? (audience cheers) I am getting so sick and tired of this Groot. I am going to beat you up. (audience cheers) - Over here!
