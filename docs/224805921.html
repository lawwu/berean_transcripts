class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=91s">00:01:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">took six verses to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=93s">00:01:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you remember, it was pretty rapid fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=95s">00:01:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was kind of like the first part of it was the seventh seal, and then as soon as that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=100s">00:01:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was done, we jumped into the trumpets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=104s">00:01:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the first four trumpets, it was pretty rapid fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=107s">00:01:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it only covered six verses from one after another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=110s">00:01:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're getting into the last time chapter 8 finished was saying that there's three woes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=115s">00:01:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=116s">00:01:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says, "Woe, woe, woe is coming."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=119s">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it signified the intensity of the judgment that's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=122s">00:02:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you've read through it and you studied it before you came, you already know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=127s">00:02:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what we're covering today is far more intense than what happened prior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=131s">00:02:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's an increasing level of judgment upon each one of these trumpets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=136s">00:02:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to be covering the two, and then the third and the significant woe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=141s">00:02:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=142s">00:02:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, it keeps increasing, and then by the time we get to the seal judgments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=146s">00:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's even more intense than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=147s">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine, if you haven't read, you can imagine just how intense it will be that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=152s">00:02:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up to this point, a third of humanity is killed and tortured, and yet the third woe hasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=158s">00:02:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">even come yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=159s">00:02:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the real severity is actually coming in the seal judgments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=165s">00:02:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the first part of it, again, just by the sheer number of verses that we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=170s">00:02:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to be covering, the first woe is a severe torment, is carried out by the demonic forces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=179s">00:02:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the abyss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=180s">00:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't say abyss, but again, the judgment seems to be coming from the abyss, and most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=185s">00:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">commentaries believe that these are demonic presence that God is using to bring about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=190s">00:03:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=191s">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So he unleashes them, and he gives them specific assignments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=195s">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this first woe that's going to be coming out in the form of locust and through what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=201s">00:03:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing is going to be tormenting the earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=204s">00:03:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This torment is going to be so severe that the people who are affected by it are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=208s">00:03:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to be seeking death for relief, but do not find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=213s">00:03:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked one of the questions, like, what would cause somebody to desire death and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=217s">00:03:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not be able to find it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=219s">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's one of the study questions that I asked you, and I'll give you an opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=223s">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to discuss it with your group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=225s">00:03:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But imagine how severe the pain is that they would have preferred death over the torment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=231s">00:03:51.960</a></span> | <span

simple disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=235s">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is excruciatingly painful, and this is not for all mankind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=239s">00:03:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It is limited to those who do not have the seal of God on them, meaning that Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=244s">00:04:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">are covered during this period, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=246s">00:04:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't believe that they are raptured, but it's going to come upon the unbelievers, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=251s">00:04:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be, again, intense torment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=255s">00:04:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The second woe is going to come with a demonic army riding horses, a 200 million mounted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=261s">00:04:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">troops, which will ultimately wipe a third of the unrepentant humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=265s">00:04:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if the first woe is tormenting the people even actually seeking death, the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=271s">00:04:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">woe that's coming, the sixth trumpet, is actually going to bring a third of humanity to a stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=279s">00:04:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They're actually going to be terminated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=283s">00:04:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it kind of gives you an outline of the severity of the judgment that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=286s">00:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=292s">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fifth trumpet, the first woe, it says in verse 9-1, "The fallen star in 9-1, right?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=318s">00:05:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's clearly different than the fallen angel that we see in chapter 8, verse 10, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=322s">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 8, verse 10, the angel falls and what happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=328s">00:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The water is contaminated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=330s">00:05:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems like, at least the way it's described in chapter 8, verse 10, that it's a mass of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=337s">00:05:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">molten material that falls on the water and contaminates, it's

but some kind of a star, maybe an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=345s">00:05:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">asteroid, maybe a nuclear

being because a key is given to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224805921#t=361s">00:06:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">being, and this being
