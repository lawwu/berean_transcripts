href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=48s">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So last night, Harry did a great job giving introductions to Pastor Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=55s">00:00:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were a little bit concerned because on the thing it says 59 slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=60s">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we thought we had 59 slides, and he called me later on, and he did that on purpose to trick us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=67s">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't realize that Harry had that side to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=70s">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just serious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=72s">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wanted to give you a brief introduction because obviously you gave the formal presentation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=78s">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I wanted to give you a more of a personal note of Pastor Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=82s">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's a good group of us in here that have a personal relationship with him, know him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=87s">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But our church, I would say more than half of you probably have never interacted with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=91s">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to give you a brief presentation of Pastor Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=97s">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've shared this with you before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Outside of my decision to follow Christ, or it wasn't my decision, but meeting Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=105s">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the next best decision that I've ever made was asking my wife out and being married to her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=112s">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was probably the second best decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=115s">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where does that start?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=116s">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you hear?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=119s">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can say confidently that outside of Pastor Aaron and his decision to follow Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=125s">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that his best decision that he made was asking his wife out, Tina.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=130s">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tina, they both met at our church, and I was there at the very inception of when Pastor Aaron started poking around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=139s">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to see if Tina would be interested, and we were actually out in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=143s">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Tina, again, she's in the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=149s">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You've probably seen her with her children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Tina was the hope of our sister's ministry when she was younger, and we were very close to her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=158s">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if she would come home from UCLA, many weekends she would spend the time at our home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=164s">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because she didn't have a place to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my wife and I spent a lot of time just talking with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a passion and love for Christ that really stood out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=174s">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when Pastor Aaron said that he had interest in her, it just made sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=178s">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The cream of the crop, all the guys, the cream of the crop and our sisters would get together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were there from the very beginning, like I said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=186s">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Pastor Aaron wouldn't be able to do what he's doing without the support of his godly wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you haven't seen her, Tina is in the back with her children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Aaron is somebody that I've known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=198s">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I met his parents before I met him when I was a youth pastor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=202s">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was a third or fourth grade, and I don't even remember his face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=206s">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just heard of his name because I was the English education director at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Sunday school teacher actually mentioned it to me that there was a rascal in the room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=216s">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that was causing all kinds of trouble, that his name came up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=220s">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I knew his name. I didn't know his face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I disappeared from the church for about a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was in another church. I came back in 1997.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=228s">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then our youth pastor at the time told me that Pastor Aaron, who was a student at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=234s">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was actually one of the student leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember the name very vaguely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=238s">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It couldn't be that Aaron that I remember from third grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=242s">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "Sure enough." He said that Aaron became a student leader,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=246s">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he was the only student leader in high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=248s">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So ever since then, we took notice that he eventually went to college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think most of us would say that one of his primary gifts is in leadership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=258s">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we saw that even since he was young, even among his friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He went to UCSD, and he became the AEM, which is basically the student leader of that group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=272s">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember very vividly one of the things that he said to me when he graduated college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=280s">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You may not remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But after college, he came to me, and he was obviously finally coming home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=287s">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole time he was at UCSD, the majority of the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=290s">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he actually drove back home just to attend church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=294s">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time, our church was so small, and we had a lot of collegiates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=298s">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who were so committed to our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=300s">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, a lot of their email names were "Brian Soldier," "Brian Honors,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=305s">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and his email was "Brian Kid."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=308s">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of people thought that we were cultists because our college students</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were so committed to our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=313s">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Councilor Aaron was equally committed, or even more committed at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he would drive back home every weekend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=321s">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember when he graduated, one of the first things that he said to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=324s">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">an encouragement, he said, "You know, because he was a leader on campus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=328s">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he realized just how difficult it was to organize people and to satisfy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people pointing out, "You should do this, you should do that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=336s">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I never prompted him, but one of the things that I remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just straight out of college--so he was still very young--he came to me and he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=343s">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I know what it's like to lead and how you're always looking for people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "I'm going to make sure that without you telling me whatever lead there is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=352s">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to set it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember hearing that and being so encouraged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=356s">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought, "This guy is straight out of college, and he's able to recognize that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=360s">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was trying to encourage me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=362s">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one of the first things that I remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=364s">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that I remember was as an ADM, at the end of the senior year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=369s">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he had to give a sermon at the end of his fourth year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=374s">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were kind of reviewing what he wanted to preach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=377s">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he came to me and he said he wanted to preach on the priesthood of Melchizedek in Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=383s">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the king priesthood of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=386s">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, "You sure you want to make that your first sermon that you ever give?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=390s">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he was telling me, he was like, "That's the sermon that he remembered me giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=395s">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on the Book of Hebrews."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=397s">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of all the things that I talked about, he said that's the thing that really stuck with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=401s">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I told him, "Oh, go prepare your sermon."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=403s">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He came out with a 14-page manuscript, and I remember telling him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=407s">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"You're not going to be able to preach this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=409s">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "I'm going to try."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=411s">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he went and he preached, and I said, "How did it go?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=414s">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Yeah, I couldn't preach it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=417s">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot how much he went through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=420s">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I tell you that story because even when he was young,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=424s">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he really had a heart for the deep things of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=427s">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are the things that attracted him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=429s">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And ever since then, that's what he reads, that's what he teaches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=433s">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he really dives into these deep things of God, even to this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=439s">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been a great encouragement to me personally during periods of the roughest periods of our church early on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=447s">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes or no, how many times I would come home and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=450s">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Man, I thank God that Aaron is serving me because he was my right-hand man."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=456s">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he went through all the difficult times in our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=460s">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we were out trying to find facilities to rent, and we were only about 25, 30 people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=466s">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was probably the biggest proponent of our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=469s">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why so many people outside of our church thought it was a cult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=472s">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because they were speaking so highly of our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=475s">00:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they would come and visit, it's like there's only 25 people here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=479s">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They made it sound like it was a mega church outside the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=482s">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he was so excited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=484s">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, Pastor Aaron, through those years, like many, many times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=488s">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've shared with him as much as I've shared with my wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=492s">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe a bit too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=494s">00:08:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how much I leaned on him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=496s">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the frustrations, anxieties, and struggles that I went through,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=501s">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">even things that I would have held from Esther, I would tell him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=505s">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because I didn't want to poison Esther, but him, I thought it would be okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=511s">00:08:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted somebody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=512s">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He told me, he's like, "Don't ever hold back because I want to know exactly what you're going through."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=517s">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because he was also head of the TORC ministry, so I wanted him to see all the good and the bad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=522s">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not only in the church but even in me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=524s">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I shared with him everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=526s">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was my right-hand man in the earlier part of the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=529s">00:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and was a source of huge encouragement to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=534s">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was sent out to BMC about five years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=536s">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They had their anniversary service, a fifth-year anniversary service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=544s">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He took a small team out there and specifically targeted that area of San Francisco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=550s">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because they were lacking churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=552s">00:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, our denomination, the Southern Baptists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=555s">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has recognized San Francisco as one of the least churched areas in the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=560s">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So because of that, they're focused on trying to really recruit people to go and plant churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=565s">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why that's the case is because they're not receptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=568s">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of churches that get planted, they fold up in a year or less and they move out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=573s">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so less and less churches are coming into that area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=576s">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Pastor Aaron, knowing that that's one of the areas that needs to be targeted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=581s">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and not only in San Francisco, Millbrae, in the middle of nowhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=584s">00:09:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for those of you guys who don't know where Millbrae is, it's because of these boobies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=589s">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At least even in San Francisco. It's not San Francisco, it's not San Jose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=592s">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's right in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=594s">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is not an area that people actually move into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=597s">00:09:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an area that people move out from because it's too expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=600s">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's why they planted a church. It's been five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=603s">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's growing. Over 200-plus members who are coming into the church, and it's growing every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=609s">00:10:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're going through growing pains because of lack of space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=613s">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, ultimately, God is using him and his wife and his team to be fruitful over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=621s">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think none of us here who've known him for as long as we have are surprised that he's being fruitful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=627s">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because he was very fruitful here before he left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=630s">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when our church got to a point where we felt like it was time for us to plant a church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=634s">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there was absolutely no question in our church who would be the best person to lead this team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=638s">00:10:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was Pastor Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=640s">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So because of his leadership and because he was so fruitful and beloved in our church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=644s">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't that hard to recruit people to go with him because he was pastoring and encouraging so many people already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=650s">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that team, he got planted up there, and they're bearing much fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=654s">00:10:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every time we turn around, as much as our church is growing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=658s">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they're growing even faster than we are in percentage-wise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=663s">00:11:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're really encouraged to have him here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=666s">00:11:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I said, our church, especially the earlier part of the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=674s">00:11:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for a large part of who we are was because of Pastor Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=678s">00:11:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Aaron had a huge impact, and many of you are here as a result of his ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=684s">00:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those of you who were college students when he was ministering here, and even his peers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=688s">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, none of these things that I'm saying is exaggerated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=692s">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because everybody who's in this room knows exactly what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=695s">00:11:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so obviously when he left to plant the church, it left a huge hole in our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=700s">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we left it vacant on purpose because we didn't want to fill that with another pastor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=706s">00:11:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to make sure that our church was able to fill in that gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=710s">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm very encouraged that many of you stepped up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=715s">00:11:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and as a result of the hole that was left with him and the team that left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=719s">00:11:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that many of you are more involved in ministry and doing the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=722s">00:12:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it's a testament to his role in our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=725s">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because he made such a big impact in our church that it left a huge hole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=729s">00:12:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how it should be when somebody is that dedicated and that fruitful in the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=734s">00:12:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that you shouldn't be able to just slip out and nobody notices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=738s">00:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I could go on and on, but you're not here to hear me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284443442#t=742s">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to introduce Pastor Aaron because it is his first
