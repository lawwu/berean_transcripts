Good evening, everybody. Let's go ahead and take our seats. We'll get situated for our Bible study to start. All right, please join with me in a word of prayer as we begin our Bible study. Heavenly Father, with our hearts joined, we want to give you thanks. God, thank you for sustaining us.</p><p>Lord, the weeks are busy. The days go fast. And there's definitely enough worry for each day, as you have said in your word. But thank you, God, that you've granted to us strength, energy, but what's more, hope, not just for today or tomorrow, but God, hope eternal. Thank you for also your word.</p><p>Thank you also for your church. Lord, in all things, God, we consider, we consider you to be so lavishing in your love. So we praise you and thank you together. It's in Christ's name. Amen. I will offer up. I will offer up my life in spirit and truth, pouring out the oil of love as my worship to you.</p><p>In surrender, I must give my every part. Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart. Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring to so faithful a friend, to so loving a king? Savior, what can be said? What can be sung as a phrase of your name for the things you have done?</p><p>Oh, my words could not tell, not even in parts, of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart. You deserve my every breath, for you paid the great cost, giving up your life to death, even death on a cross. You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin, opened up the gates of heaven, and have beckoned me in.</p><p>Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring to so faithful a friend, to so loving a king? Savior, what can be said? What can be sung as a phrase of your name for the things you have done? Oh, my words could not tell, not even in parts, of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart.</p><p>Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring to so faithful a friend, to so loving a king? Savior, what can be said? What can be sung as a phrase of your name for the things you have done? Oh, my words could not tell, not even in parts, of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart.</p><p>Give thanks. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ His Son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ His Son. And now let the weak say, I am strong.</p><p>Let the poor say, I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. And now let the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say, I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks. Give thanks. Give thanks with a grateful heart.</p><p>Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ His Son. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Give thanks to the Holy One. Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ His Son. And now let the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say, I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us.</p><p>And now let the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say, I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. And now let the weak say, I am strong. Let the poor say, I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us. Give thanks.</p><p>Father, we thank you, Lord, for this opportunity to worship you. We pray, Lord, some of us may be coming from a busy day of work or a busy day of school, and we haven't been thinking about you. We pray and ask, Lord, that you would humble our hearts, that we're reminded of how much we need you each and every day.</p><p>We also pray that we're reminded of how much you've given to us. You've given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, Lord. You've given us our jobs, our finances, Lord. We pray that we would live our lives as living sacrifices to you, ready to serve you, ready to surrender all things to you, Lord.</p><p>So we thank you, pray for a great time of small group, a fruitful discussion. We love you, pray all this in your name. Amen. - All right, good evening again. Let's take a look together at some of the things that are taking place. One need for our Wednesday Bible study is we need helping hands with preparing our facility.</p><p>As you guys noticed, there's tables and chairs that we set up, and then at 9.30, we have a cleanup crew. So please use this QR code if you would please help us out with the setup and cleanup. Next, last call for our men's ministry fellowship. It's taking place this Saturday.</p><p>So if you've been procrastinating, please do it now, okay? The QR code is up there. Go ahead and sign up for that at this time. The next thing is that our outreach team is putting together a special dinner to invite your non-believing family and friends. As it is Thanksgiving time, we're going to be, you know, having a nice meal together, but giving a gospel presentation based on giving thanks to our Lord for all the goods in our life, but more so than anything, for the great good of Christ.</p><p>So if you would like to invite and bring a guest with you, please sign up and let us know. Even if you don't know the answer, whether the person you're inviting can commit or not, you can let us know, give us a heads up, and we'll be praying alongside you, okay?</p><p>The other announcement for the month of November is we'll be having our periodic cleaning and maintenance day for the whole church. So please sign up. It's an awesome time of fellowship, getting our hands dirty together, putting, you know, all the necessary things away, et cetera, and it's a pretty big event trying to get everybody coordinated, so please sign up for that to help out.</p><p>As you guys know, we've been also announcing our regional Thanksgiving dinner. The sign-up for that is closing at some point soon, so please make sure you sign up because group notifications will go out by next week. So that takes place Sunday, November 24th, at 5 p.m. And then finally, for everybody within the family ministry, there is going to be a Christmas party on December 7th at 5 p.m.</p><p>So please come join in the fellowship. There's going to be various activities taking place, and again, the QR code is there for you to register for that. All right, as a reminder, the lesson will be at 8. I hope you guys have a good discussion.</p></div></body></html>
