the events of Passion Week leading up to our Lord and Savior's crucifixion. And if there's one thing that I was reminded of this week, it is truly just how unworthy I am of Christ and His sacrifice on that cross.</p><p>The Son of God who is worthy would die for me, the unworthy, that I may live. And so what a great mystery that is that His amazing grace would come to me. So tonight as we gather to worship and to receive His word, to partake in communion together, may we look to Christ, may we look to the cross, the ultimate display of God's love for us, that we may respond with much gratitude and affection toward Him.</p><p>So let's worship together.

It is a very significant time, and every day of this Passion Week, as we've been meeting together, to think about the steps that Christ took to the cross and to his resurrection, every single day is as important as the last.</p><p>And Good Friday, some might ask, why is it that for a resurrected Christ that we would spend year after year thinking about his death and the horrendous picture that we just kind of replay over and over again year after year? It's incredibly important for us to remember the happening of Good Friday, that before we can just kind of run to the next part, before we can run to the love and grace and compassion that we so love to just think about and be grateful for, that we have to see what sin cost, and we have to see what sin is that would cause us to worship rightly.</p><p>And so, especially for the visitors, but for all of us who are celebrating the death of Christ, which is a very strange thing to celebrate, when we sing these songs that are coming up here, they're going to be teaching and speaking of this gospel message of Christ, the cross, and what he accomplished for us.</p><p>So, I would really invite us all to bring our hearts together to worship him, to contemplate, to think, and to meditate. And so, I'll open us up in prayer here. Heavenly Father, I pray, God, that your gospel would sink deep into us. Father, please help us. God, break through our stubbornness, our blindness.</p><p>God, to see appropriately what you have accomplished, that on this night, as we think about Good Friday, a Friday that does not seem in any way good, Lord, that it would be the greatest news for us because our Christ died for our sins. And so, Father, I pray for genuine worship to come.</p><p>I pray, Father, for all eyes to look upon you, that we would be grateful and that we would crown you our God, our King, our Lord, our everything. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

Okay, well, again, everyone, if you came a little bit later, welcome to our Good Friday service. Let me go ahead and open us up in prayer. If you'll bow your heads with me. Oh, Father, God, that song is so powerful, not because of any other reason than the message it says.</p><p>God, you were slain for us. Jesus, thank you for taking our punishment. Father, thank you so much for sending your Son. Thank you, God, that as a result of this Gospel, that many of us who have been saved can raise our voices together in unity and proclaim the praises of our King, of what he did.</p><p>Lord, help us to take a good, long look again at the glories of Calvary, at what was accomplished, that we could not do and only he could. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Well, for a brief rundown of these events that we've been going through in Passion Week, on the next slide here, on Sunday, we went through Palm Sunday.</p><p>I know that's very small. I'm sorry about that. But on Sunday, it was a triumphal entry. That's what was preached this past Sunday, the message as people were singing "Hosanna, Hosanna," and Jesus simply wept. Because though the myriads of people were worshiping God, that Jesus knew, and Jesus understood what was going on in their hearts, that these very same people would be the ones jeering at him very soon.</p><p>The second day on Monday, Jesus curses the fig tree, and then he just simply leaves it, and the disciples wonder what happened there, and then he begins to cleanse the temple. He goes to the place of worship, the greatest place of worship, especially during this Passover season, and he goes, and when the most people are gathered in the year, he begins to flip over these tables and saying that he does not receive this.</p><p>You have turned this temple into a den of robbers. On the third day, Jesus pronounces judgment and parables and woes upon the religious leaders of Israel, the very people who would be teachers of the law and who would be the keepers of the temple, the ones who are the most religious, the ones who fasted the most, who studied and memorized the scriptures, who are the ones to be looked up to, the ones you would call rabbi, and all of those things that come along with this religion, that them he would give the greatest woes.</p><p>Two days ago, we looked at Judas betraying Jesus into the hands of these religious leaders, that the religious leaders of Israel held hands with one of Jesus' closest friends, and together they conspired to kill Christ. And yesterday, Jesus leads the Last Supper. It's his farewell discourse as he begins to tell of the fact that he will be leaving and that the Holy Spirit will be coming.</p><p>He washes the feet of his disciples and then they make their way to Gethsemane. And at Gethsemane, he goes through such agonizing prayer asking God to take away this cup, the very cup that we're going to be looking at today, the cup of wrath, that's not found physically on a cross, but as the wrath of God is being poured out, as he was looking down the barrel of eternal wrath from his Father, that he prays in that garden asking if there's any way for it to be different.</p><p>But he asks that God's will would be done and not his. He is resolute. His face does not move away from what he is here to do, to die for the very people who want him killed. And so this is Passion Week. It's the week that answers humanity's greatest problem.</p><p>The Passion Week is so important for us. Pastor Peter Chung, when he came up on Monday, said this is, in fact, the most important week in all of history, and I agree. When we look around this world, there are so many problems. Many of us are experiencing those very problems today.</p><p>There's great brokenness in our lives. You know somebody who's dying. You know somebody who's sick. You yourself might be in that condition. If you were to just turn around and take a look at what's going on in your family, there are many of us who have broken families, people you have not seen or talked to in years, divorces, adultery, children who don't have parents.</p><p>When we look around at the wars that are going on, we look around what's happening in our offices, the gossip, the slander, the backstabbing. In our groups of friends, in all of what's going on around us, there is brokenness. There is depression. There's violence. There's anger. There's hatred and theft.</p><p>People are taking advantage of people. There are disasters and tragedies and diseases. There are those who are going hungry. But again, Passion Week is not here to address all of those. Passion Week is here to address humanity's greatest problem. All of what I just mentioned are symptoms of this greatest problem.</p><p>And that is the impending reality of eternal death. And that's what we're going to be talking about today. When Jesus came into the world, that's what He came to address. We think of Him as a good teacher and He was going around helping people and healing people. But He never once said that that's what He came to do.</p><p>He always used those as opportunities to point to a greater reality of what He actually came to do. Yes, He healed people. He cast out demons. He multiplied bread to feed the hungry. He stopped storms and He temporarily brought people back to life. He was always pointing to the fact that these were temporary miracles staving off what's coming in this impending death that is for everyone.</p><p>The fatal end of every human being that He was ultimately trying to point to. So we want to ask some questions today. And the first is this. Why is there death in the world today? That's our first question. Why is there death in the world today? Many of us have just accepted it as a fact of life.</p><p>That is actually, it's just what are we going to do? That's what happens. It's inevitable. You asking why or knowing why it happens isn't going to change the fact that it will come. But if we're to stop and ask the question why is there death? The Bible answers it.</p><p>What we do know is that death is real. And I have some slides for us here. We find cemeteries and in these cemeteries we know that it's filled with people who used to live just like you and me. If there were enough of these tombstones that could number the amount of people who are here that they used to be us.</p><p>That all of us will one day be them. I know it's a depressing thought but it's Good Friday we're talking about death. This is death. It's waiting for each of us. There is not one of us who can't, it doesn't matter what we believe. It doesn't matter what we do.</p><p>This is going to come. I just googled it. I just googled cemeteries of famous people and these are the first three that popped up. Here's the first one. John Wayne. I wasn't around during his lifetime I think. I think it was 1970 something. I was born after that so I never saw him.</p><p>I never knew him. All I know is that he's a famous man. He accomplished a lot. He was an actor I believe and so you look at it and for all that he accomplishes at the end he ends up in one of the tombstones. The next guy that popped up was Charles Chaplin.</p><p>I thought he was a lot older than that but he passed away in 1977 and a more recent one was Queen Elizabeth. These were people who accomplished many things and I was just curious to see what would pop up and these were the first three that popped up. It doesn't matter, right?</p><p>At the end we can have romantic notions of what they've accomplished and what they've done but this inevitable end can't be lost on us. That they could have left behind even some form of legacy that most of us will not ever be able to even dream of becoming like that but what of them now?</p><p>For them, not for us. What are they thinking now? What are they feeling now? What do they want now? Did anything they did actually matter for their now? These cemeteries then show that at the end next slide it brings us to the same place. Here's a 90 year human life in months.</p><p>If you are a college student and you've been with me in Searchlight I would have showed you this slide before in particular. This is a 90 year human life in months. You would be lucky to live 90 years. Look how sobering that is. Each of those circles is a month.</p><p>One line is three years and so we can actually do this. If I were to print this out for each of us we can all fill out how many months in our lives have already passed by. I know it's a very depressing exercise to do this. You can do that in your mind right now.</p><p>How many lines have you filled out? And how many are left? Now this is small. Let's get a little bit smaller. That's how many days we have. Can't even see it. That's how many days we have. So we check these off day by day by day. It doesn't matter.</p><p>No matter who we are no matter what we've accomplished we're checking these things off. We could be the most intelligent person in the world. We could be the strongest in the world. We could be the fastest person. We could have multiple Olympic gold medals under our name. We could have cured diseases that save millions of people.</p><p>We could have created the greatest of inventions and it does not matter because at the end we end up in the same place. You could have healed someone and say like wow what a great man that his accomplishments would heal these many people only to have them also follow you to death.</p><p>That's depressing. No one knows why we die only that we do. Something happens to the cells. They degenerate. They mutate towards death. No one knows why. It's inevitable. It's a reality. If you were to imagine an hourglass every single one of us has a certain number of sands. Grains of these sands that are preordained for us and every moment I am taking away your precious life right now.</p><p>The sand of your life is currently falling. You cannot get that back. You cannot stop it. You cannot freeze it. You cannot add more. Ninety years. If we go to the next slide here's another exercise. These are Super Bowls. For those of us it's hard to understand and comprehend.</p><p>There's a Super Bowl every year. Some of us really look forward to it at least for the show or the chips. Every year that goes by I am 37 years old. If we go to the next slide that's how many Super Bowls have already passed from me. That's how many Super Bowls that I have left.</p><p>That's how many more. There's nothing to stop this. If we go to the next slide if you don't like Super Bowl how many times do you see snow? Most people see it every year if you're in Southern California because you feel like it's your duty to go and see snow once a year or you go to the ocean once a year because we probably should.</p><p>Again, 37 years old that's how many times I'm going to see the snow. That's if I live 90 years. Can we go all the way? Yeah. Okay. Whoa. You just took away my life very quickly. All right. If we go to the next slide here this is the actual average lifespan of the human in America.</p><p>This is America. This would be a little bit of a closer bet and if you guys are older than me then you have more X's on this but we don't even know if we have 75 years. There's a possibility if we go to the next slide we have 60 years or we might have 40 years.</p><p>I'm 37. I might live only to 38 years old and quite honestly I might just die tomorrow and I would have already seen my last day. No more snow for me. In Psalm chapter 90 verse 9 through 12 it says, "For all our days have declined in your fury.</p><p>We have finished our years like a sigh. As for the days of our life they contain 70 years or if due to strength 80 years yet their pride is but labor and sorrow for soon it is gone and we fly away. Who understands the power of your anger and your fury according to the fear that is due you?" So listen to this.</p><p>It says, "So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom that numbering our days that doing this exercise tonight I feel no remorse or apology towards you for taking away the sands of that because at the end he says that numbering your days brings you wisdom.</p><p>It sobers you up to understand and recognize the brevity of life that death is pending and that it is coming and that it is sure and the world tries to cope with this. You and I have tried to cope with this. We've tried to figure out ways to deal with it to get away from thinking about it.</p><p>Some of us straight up we will deny it that we will pretend that it's not going to happen that our children will never die that our parents perhaps will be okay but it is coming and every time the reality hits closer and closer and closer to home it brings us to greater and greater states of wisdom.</p><p>There are many of us who are staving it off that perhaps we know it's coming and so then we will exercise we will take multivitamins we will go to the doctor and get our checkups that we will do what we were told to do. There are many of us who are not thinking about it that we're covering over it with entertainment with hobbies with our careers with advancement but it's there death coming for us all.</p><p>It's not a fear tactic I'm employing tonight. This is a simple reality. The Bible says that there is going to be something that comes at the end of that last thing. So it's our question why is there death in the world today? Why? I did nothing to answer it.</p><p>I just put in more why I mean that it is there that it's going to happen that it's sure. Well that Psalm 90 that we looked at actually answers it right before. This is what it said before but look at the verses right before there. It says for we have been consumed by your anger and by your wrath.</p><p>We have been dismayed. You have placed our iniquities before you our secret sins in the light of your presence and then that's why for all our days have declined in your fury. The Bible actually answers the question as to why we die. We all know we do it doesn't matter what you believe or what religion you come back from we all know we die.</p><p>The Bible tells us why it happens. It's because of our sin. It is his wrath upon sinners. That's what death is. It's not just an inevitable reality of life. It is the consequence of our state. It is the consequence of our behavior our words our thoughts our deeds our thoughts.</p><p>Romans 6.23 says for the wages of sin is death. This brokenness inside of us all this sin inside of us all no person needs to be taught how to sin. We are born into sin. We are born into rebellion. We don't need to be taught how to be selfish.</p><p>Yes there is a moral compass instilled into us all but we were made into the image of God and yet we are born wretched and depraved from the very beginning. Listen to what J.C. Ryle says. He says alas alas it lies smiling and crowing in its cradle. You know what that is?</p><p>That's a baby. That's a cute baby. That little creature carries in it in its heart the seeds of every kind of wickedness. Only watch it carefully as it grows and its mind develops and you will soon detect in it an incessant tendency to that which is bad and a backwardness to that which is good.</p><p>You will see in it the buds and germs of deceit evil temper selfishness self-will obstinacy greediness envy jealousy passion which if indulged and let alone will shoot up with painful rapidity. Who taught the child these things? Where did he learn them? The Bible alone can answer these questions and all the foolish things that parents say about their children.</p><p>There is none worse than the common saying my son has a good heart at the bottom. He is not what he ought to be but he has fallen into bad hands. Public schools are bad places. The tutors neglect the boys. Yet he has a good heart at the bottom.</p><p>The truth unhappily is diametrically the other way. The first cause of all sin lies in the natural corruption of the boy's own heart and not in the school. Romans 3.23 says for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God for every single one of us have fallen into this kind of depraved living.</p><p>Earlier on in the text it said that there is none righteous not even one and what we pursue are more and more and more of the same. So our second question is why is sin so egregious that it would require death? That is the reason. Why is there death?</p><p>Because of sin. What about sin would require my death? If somebody killed just serially murdered 7,000 people and we say maybe him but what about somebody who killed no one and just lied? What is it about sin? Well the scriptures teach us because it's not simply about the offense of whom you offend.</p><p>You know what's interesting is that when we are in a certain state it is hard to see outside of that state. If you were to live in a community where everything is just terribly difficult that people are stealing and hurting each other and stomping on each other to get ahead in life and you just grow up and that's not a thing.</p><p>It would be a strange thing for you to just come to a place like Irvine where there's so much order and everything is so manicured and so when you get plucked out of a certain state you can see it but when you're in it it's impossible to see. We begin to say this is just how things are.</p><p>So if you're in a place where there is rampant crime then people are just going to grow up saying this is how things are. I'm not saying we're okay with it it's just this is how it is and we're surrounded by this and what happens in our state the reason why we have such a kicking back a rebellious attitude against this fact that sin would actually require my death is because we are currently in a world where we cannot see outside of that and so then we begin to create standards in accordance to what we see and in accordance to the world order that we live in that I am better than that person and so therefore there's a standard that I can draw and we all start to do that and we do that here and we look at like criminals out there and we say well they are worse so I get sin death for them but for me sin going to death makes no sense and we create these standards that make no sense because there is nothing to tether itself to that's why Ryle he says I do not think in the nature of things that mortal man can at all realize the exceeding sinfulness of sin in the sight of that holy and perfect one with whom we have to do he is the one who reads thoughts and motivates us as well as actions and requires truth in the inward parts we on the other hand poor blind creatures here today and gone tomorrow born in sin surrounded by sinners living in a constant atmosphere of weakness infirmity and imperfection can form none but the most inadequate conceptions of the hideousness of evil we have no line to fathom it and no measure by which to gauge it this sin in the sight of the one we offend we have broken his laws there is a reason why there is morality inside of us there is a reason why we are able to say that there is good and there is bad you can say all you want that this was developed over time in history no there is something inside of us when we see somebody smashing in the head of a baby that all of us would react and say that that is evil because there is something inside of us that understands that now where we draw the line we all do what is right in our own eyes we get to create the standards of that whether by culture or by society or by governmental laws that are created whether it is by familial structure or the culture that has been developed by our church but these sins are severe before God enough for him to say that the wages of sin is death sin is corruption and there is reason why Jesus comes and he links something like lust which is in us all to adultery and we say I get it those people committed adultery I know I know lust is not good I will try my best but those people committed adultery will create a standard and a line that divides me from them he links murder with anger there is anger in us all bitterness and resentment and he says it is anger anger is murder and it is liable to the hell fire it shows the problem of our sin see we get caught up in thinking sin are the sinful things that we do it is not sin comes from the sinner it is talking about a state of an individual you don't say about the person with cancer oh they have cancerous cells you would say only that they have sin so then to the one who has done bad things we would not just say that they have done bad things they only did these few bad things you would say that they are a bad person I know that is hard right but we all have lines for that at a certain point if somebody has killed many people and says to you but I just killed a few people but for real though I am a father and you should see how much I love my child you say no no we understand that we as a society are so good at trivializing our sin we use our own standards and rubrics to form the acceptability of our actions but they are all over the map we say some things like are okay and we would say that other things are not okay and once we set them we yell at each other we grow what we think to be righteous anger we become judges when we are the ones who are on trial to be judged there is a deep corruption in all of us we are liars we are thieves we are adulterers we are murderers we might say that's not me that's not my reality but this is the reality there are criminals who say that we are not bad people we will say that we are not bad people we think that we can draw the same claim before God come to him and say I'm not so bad I'm mostly good and we might think it's not that big of a deal but it's only shrouded we might be polite we might have grown in courtesy and thoughtfulness but it goes down deep into our hearts we look a certain way but our hearts are wicked and corrupt the words that pop out the thoughts that come to our minds are symptoms of the deeper reality that we are sinners we like to put aside sin and call it a disease we blame it on the culture we hold others culpable for what has happened to me Ryle also says that sin is the universal disease of all mankind it's this idea no matter the fact that you have not you could come from an isolated island that has never touched any form of civilization and sin would still be found there as sin is everywhere and so this is what the Bible says this is the reason why the reality of death that is universal to all mankind is upon us because sin is universal that's why we die and we live our lives with the hourglass day by day dropping in sand thinking that this is important or that is important and I have to do this and I have to accomplish this and I'll try to be like this only for every day to pass by closer and closer only this one singular problem matters there at the end this problem of death and the God who stands looming over us there will always be death because there will always be sin and you cannot justify you cannot cure this there is no outrunning sin there is no hiding from sin you cannot justify your way out of it and no excuse will be enough your morality is not enough your skills are not enough your personality is not going to be enough your services your works your intellect your legacy that you leave behind your attempts at compromising and pleading and negotiating and smooth talking before God is not going to be enough there will be death waiting and so third point what is death?</p><p>death is not just the end of existence we think that's what death is that's what we see it's just a grave it's a cemetery that that's the end but that this is only a picture this is only a symbol this is only a foreshadow of what's actually happening death is eternal it is eternal death it's perpetual death it's perpetual death it's perpetual death it's eternal death it's perpetual it is continuous it will know no end death is seen only in part here in this world death is only manifested in temporary things here in the current passing things that we see we will see glimpses of death in our lives with broken cars broken dreams end of seasons we'll see end of a relationship we'll see sickness take hold only glimpses of it all this to say that inevitably will go away death is only a picture inevitably will go to the end of life and it's death and that's why it unsettles us because there are stamps of this pending reality of eternal death and eventually we all end up there inevitably in the ground but so much more death is utter and complete eternal destruction death is not just a state of non-existence death is not a state of non-existence death is not just a state of non-existence we will not just turn into dirt the bible says that death is eternal in consequence because of who God is the bible says that God is of pure eyes he cannot behold sin he cannot look upon evil the bible says that God is so pure that the smallest of sins cannot be overlooked he is the perfect judge the bible says that God is so pure a judge that he doesn't just look at the outer actions but the inner state secret sins inside of us will not be left unaccounted for the bible says that God is a judge he is so pure that there is everlasting punishment that there is a what the bible says would be a worm that does not die and a fire that is never quenched God is so pure that no sinful person has any hope of entering heaven and eternal life and so it leaves us to bring us into the passion account because the point is that we're in big trouble we're in huge trouble I don't know if at any point we've turned off but we are not guaranteed the ability to walk out those doors tonight not a single one of us is guaranteed our very next breath we are in huge trouble if we die in the state of sin right now is a time of grace where God is giving us opportunity but that brings us to our fourth point is before that comes tonight the answer for sin and death is Christ on the cross sin is dealt with in Jesus Christ why does the Passion Week matter because it tells us about sin and it tells us about the solution to our greatest problem that God is full of justice and wrath not in any way compromising his goodness but God is loving and compassionate and kind and merciful see sin is not just a disease it's not just a passive reality that slowly kills us sin is active what we see as we just conclude in a passage like this is that sin is active sin is what we've been seeing all week long it is intentional it is purposed and it is desiring to do away with God to kill the creator of life death is because of sin death is because of this judgment for our sinfulness and so that is what is coming out to us Matthew chapter 26 verse 47 through 50 and this is sin made alive not just the people that we read about but our sin can be seen in this text verse 47 while he was still speaking behold Judas one of the twelve came up unaccompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs who came from the chief priests and elders of the people now he who was betraying him gave them a sign saying whomever I kiss he is the one seize him immediately Judas went to Jesus and said Rabbi and kissed him and Jesus said to him friend do what you have come for then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized him verse 56 but this all this has taken place to fulfill the scriptures of the prophets then all the disciples left and fled I hope that every juncture of this week showed you that every party that was involved that was me that that was us that there is some rebuke in our lives because of this that what we see here in Judas is not a story two thousand years ago so far off this is sin personified this is what our sin is this is how ugly it looks that that Jesus he followed that Jesus he pursued the Jesus who loved him the Jesus who would do so much for him that he would turn and give him over like this continuing in verse 59 look at the continuing nature of our sin personified now the chief priest and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death look at how active they are they keep trying over and over somebody that we can put to death this Christ verse 65 then the high priest tore his robes and said he has blasphemed what further need do we have of witnesses behold you have now heard the blasphemy what do we what do you think and they answered he deserves death then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists and others slapped him and said prophesy to us you Christ who is the one who hit you this is our sin we think our sin is not such a big deal it is us it is me who slapped the author of life it is me who mocks him who spits upon him Matthew 27 22-26 Pilate said to them then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ they all said crucify him and he said why what evil has he done but they kept shouting all the more saying crucify him when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing but rather that a riot was starting he took water washed his blood washed his hands in front of the crowd saying I am innocent of this man's blood see to that yourselves and all the people said his blood shall be on us and on our children oh my goodness look at that then he released Barabbas for them but after having Jesus scourged he handed him over to be crucified this is us this is our sin personified this is why sin deserves what it deserves this is the prime example this is sin exemplified calling for the death of the God who gave himself to save us a God who desires it to such a great degree that he would come down from heavens heights it's so clearly seen here in this crucifixion that we are participants participants Christ was not just killed he was not just put to death he was murdered by a seething people it was not just a call to kill Jesus but to scorn and mock him to inflict punishment upon him we who are at the mercy of his judgment would put Jesus Christ on trial and judge him we the guilty would judge the innocent and we would say I've done no wrong you have done wrong we would look upon evil and call it good and look upon good and call it evil this is the sin inside of us this very day it manifests in different ways but in every single one of us this is what resides John Stott says were you there when they crucified my Lord and we must answer yes we were there not as spectators only but as participants guilty participants plotting scheming betraying bargaining and handing him over to be crucified we may try to wash our hands of responsibility like Pilate but our attempt will be as futile as his for there is blood on our hands before we can begin to see the cross as something done for us leading us to faith and worship we have to see it as something done by us leading us to repentance indeed only the man who is prepared to own his share in the guilt of the cross wrote Ken and Peter Green the same his share in its grace participants every Good Friday we ought to remember that we are not reading a story of other people that did something to this God man we are staring at a story that reflects as a mirror into my very own heart that my lying my lusting my selfishness my anger is seen Matthew 27 27 then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around him they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and after twisting together a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they knelt down before him and mocked him saying hail king of the Jews they spat on him and took the reed and began to beat him on the head after they had mocked him they took the scarlet robe off him and put his own garments back on him and led him away to crucify him they took the responsibility of his blood and now this is the continuing condition of humanity on God this is sin continuing in verse 45 now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying that is my God my God why have you forsaken me and some of those who are standing there when they heard it began saying this man is calling for Elijah immediately one of them ran and taking a sponge he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink but the rest of them said let us see whether Elijah will come to save him what a comical sight what is happening here and then in verse 50 perhaps one of the most shocking shocking lines in all of scripture and Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit human sin will not stop until Christ is crucified dead done away with we cannot exist co-exist with a God who is dead co-exist with a God like this because sin is bloodthirsty it's spewing it's angry it cries for death of God human sin is vicious against God and rebellious human sin can't tolerate the existence of God who threatens our sovereignty our desires our pleasures we need him out of the picture we need him gone and we hate him for it we hate that he demands these things and so what we see here is the impossible the eternal one the ageless one the alpha and the omega the one who was who is and who is to come the omnipotent one he breathes his last and yields his spirit death death falls upon Christ death falls upon Christ the death that is inevitable to us all because of our sin falls upon the sinless one that's impossible Jerry Bridges says man's sin was not a mere paper debt it was not a hypothetical debt it was an actual legal debt it was Christ's own flesh that was nailed to the cross as he was made sin on our behalf paying our legal debt costs Christ agonizing pain and separation from his father as he bore the full force of God's wrath against the offense of sin and at the cross Christ extinguished the wrath of God toward believing sinners by his own bloody death thereby paying the full legal debt due by sinners so on this Good Friday Jesus accomplishes the first half of what is needed for our salvation he pays the punishment of eternal death for all those who had placed their faith in him and remember death is not a simple annihilation it is not a simple just conclusion to his life it is taking on eternal death if our debt is eternal death then what was accomplished in Christ is that he takes on eternal death a perpetual continuous death that knows no end a worm that never dies a fire that is never quenched was poured out upon Christ when he yields his spirit it was not the people that held him there it was not the nails that held him there it was not his physical humanity that was just ending that held him there or it was not the end of his existence in such a physical manner what was happening on that cross is that he yielded his spirit that he chose to march to physical and spiritual death that he died that's Good Friday and so the story concludes at least of this portion in verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom and the earth shook and the rocks were split the tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many now the centurion and those who were with him were looking over Jesus when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening became very frightened and said truly this was the son of God we ask the question how could a good God allow there to be eternal death the proper question is why would a good God send his son to take this but that is the gospel what we see is how much God loves us and it makes no sense that what we see with Jesus marching through the spitting the stripping the mocking the jamming of thorns onto his head the beating the tearing him apart piercing him all of that to a people who wanted him dead he made no move to protect himself he made no move to stop what was occurring because he wanted to save the very people who were nailing him to the cross that's how much God loves us that he would that a father would send his only son knowing that this would happen that a son would lay down his life for us willingly the greatest problem of humanity is death it's not your unpaid bills it is not your health problem it is not the broken relationship that is in your life they are not unrealized dreams they are not things that we do not have our biggest problem is our sin and the death that it brings and all other issues we have in life are symptoms of that and tonight just to conclude here is that the cross then says I like the way Martin Lloyd-Jones puts it says that the cross declares the cross proclaims that by the story we read that he demands of us to repent of our sins that that death that is inevitably coming for us all if we are to repent of our sins and place our faith in the Christ who did this for us that we will be saved from that death I would like us as we enter into a time of communion to take time to think about our sins to pull that together with reality as we think about what it is that communion is I'm going to take a moment to pray for us and then we'll enter into this time together Heavenly Father I pray God that as the sermon ends and as a time for our reflection begins Lord that your spirit would be powerfully moving in a way that my words could not and Father where my words lack God I please I pray to you right now that you would do a great work in the hearts Father to show us our great need for you to turn away from the sins that we are living in to turn in gratitude towards the Christ who would do this so Father I pray that your gospel your cross would preach and proclaim that it would declare to everyone of our hearts what is needed of us that it might move us to repentance in Jesus name we pray Amen Well we're going to be doing this communion and we always want to remember the importance and seriousness of participating in the Lord's table and tonight is especially important because we have many visitors with us for us who believe in the authority of the scriptures this communion is one of two ordinances there are instructions given by Christ to us the church and so Jesus gave this symbol as a symbol and a reminder to us and we are to continually regularly in remembrance do what he has called us to until he returns at his second coming and so tonight what we're doing is taking up these elements and it is only for the Christian it is only for the believer who has been baptized who has declared and proclaimed their faith in Christ so if that is not you we pray we please ask that you do not participate in communion tonight do not come up do not take up the elements if you are in a place of unconfessed sin we also ask you to stay in your seats and at least take this moment to repent of your sin and that means to turn away and to make a concerted decisive action tonight to say that I will no longer walk down this path and then and only then as you have repented and turned away from your sin to come and take the elements with us in 1 Corinthians 11 23 it says for I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you that the Lord Jesus in the night in which you was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me for as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but a man must examine himself and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup for he who eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly and
