I was younger, I thought of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=172s">00:02:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness just like I thought about

think about practical holiness, I got to think about what I should and should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=211s">00:03:31.220</a></span> |

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1164s">00:19:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The point is, the "Be holy for I am holy," the calling that God gives us, can be seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1170s">00:19:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">as an objective standard of God.</span></div><div

timeless, which is broad and universal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1207s">00:20:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1208s">00:20:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe for us, again, when we think of the concept of holiness, we're thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1212s">00:20:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">things where we're supposed to stay away from things that are vile, wicked, detestable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1217s">00:20:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and namely, we're thinking about

set of propositions or statements, but rather,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1241s">00:20:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it is an objective

can be focused</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252204226#t=1255s">00:20:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">on God's statement, "Be holy for I am holy," but
