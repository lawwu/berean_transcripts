So if you are planning to pray, to do that, we ask you to come sit up in the white chairs, okay? And then as we get started, again, like in the time we're just gonna move the white chairs out. So if you're planning to do that, just sit there and then right before we get into prayer time, we're gonna move the chairs, just kind of giving you a heads up. And just like before, we're gonna ask people who are gonna be praying, who want prayer from the leadership to come to the front and then we're gonna take some time to pray over you. And then we have something at the end that we're gonna be praying for certain needs in the church and we'll kind of give you a heads up on that as well, okay? So if you are planning to just at some point, just kind of move down to the white chairs and then you can, we have carpets on the ground, so if you wanted to pray, we'll have that ready for you, okay? - Why don't we just take a minute or two just to gather our thoughts, to come before the Lord in preparation as we spend some time worshiping and praying. (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) - Let's pray together. Father, we come before you, thankful that you gathered your church to come and pray, to acknowledge that you are Lord, that you are God, that you are gracious to us, that we are undeserving of your mercy. Father, I pray that as we spend time tonight praying, soften our hearts, Lord God, with all the distractions around us, Lord God, help us focus our attention to what we're doing tonight. Lord God, as we sing, let our hearts be engaged in the words that we sing. As we pray, as we spend time individually coming before you, help us, Lord God, know what to pray and how to pray. Lord, fill our minds with things that are needed in our lives, spiritual things, Lord God, that we may not have been focused on. Lord, as we pray diligently, earnestly, with zeal, and as we pray for those things as a corporate body, Lord God, soften our hearts, break us, Lord God, to see what is around us. Help us not be fixated upon our own lives, but help us to see what you see around us, the people you placed in our lives, the things, Lord God, that need to be saturated in prayer. So, God, I pray that this night may be a night of blessing, a night of communion with you, and that you continue to bless the body of Christ, this church, Lord God, as we worship and pray to you. So we entrust this time to you, asking for your grace again. It's in Christ's name we pray, amen. Let's all stand together as we sing. Again, we're going to spend some time worshiping our God, and then it will lead into individual prayer after Pastor Peter gives us some encouragement.

(bell tolling) Let me read the text with you from Ephesians chapter six, verses 10. Finally, be strong in the Lord in the strength of his might. Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, having done everything to stand firm. Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayers and petition, pray at all times in the spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints. Pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, and make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel. Let's pray. Father, help us to cut through our facade, our religiousness, our desire for presentation over substance. Lord, reveal with your word and your Holy Spirit that we would be naked before you. Search us, Lord God, for any hidden sins, any compromise, any hardened hearts, any bitterness, any evil thoughts, anything, Lord God, that we have not surrendered to you, that your word and your spirit would search us, that our prayers, Lord God, will be truthful and honest and desperate. We pray that your word would teach us, reveal to us, rebuke us, challenge us. Help us, Lord God, in our weakness to pray with all prayer, with all the saints, with desperateness. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. How many of you would honestly confess when the Bible warns us about having a form of godliness yet no power? How many of you will say that that is the case and yet you've been in that situation for years? You go through the motion, you do what you're supposed to do but you know that you have picked and chosen what is easy and you have held for yourself what is difficult. You're willing to do what God calls you to do as long as it doesn't disturb your life too much, as long as you can maintain your life and still serve the Lord. And as a result of that, you have held on to a form of godliness and you do not know the power of God. I would say many of us would probably confess that that is the case. We ask ourselves and we need to ask ourselves, do you really believe? Do you really believe that the son of God came off of his throne and gave up everything that you and I may have life? And if you believe that, do you also believe that he will come as a conquering warrior to separate the sheep and the goat, to judge the righteous and the unrighteous, to distinguish between those who genuinely believed and those who held on to form, a religiousness? That Christianity has made your life a better life. Because you made some friends. It gave you hope. It taught morals. It gave you purpose, community. But you cannot honestly confess that Christ is Lord. Not Lord over what you've chosen to give him. Not Lord over the things that are convenient. But Lord. Have you ever said to the Lord, here am I, send me. And actually meant it. Have you ever confessed, say you are my Lord, Lord over all things, and actually meant it? And you're not Lord over all things, but you're Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. You're Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. You're Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. You're Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And you're not Lord over all things. And yet the angel of light can come in the context of the culture of the community. When we're deceived to think that the cultural Christianity is the Christianity. And that the church as a whole could be deceived. The church as a whole could be deceived. And headed down the path of judgment. It is Satan comes to deceive us. And we are warned to stay alert. 1 Peter 5, 8, "Be sober in spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. But resist him firm in your faith." 2 Corinthians 2, 8-10 "The lawless one at the end will be revealed." Meaning the work of the lawless one, the Antichrist is working. But in the end times it would be made clear where that line is. How much of what we do is real? How much of what you believe and practice is real? Or have we created a form of Christianity? A subculture of Christianity? Well we're no longer wrestling to know the truth. And to practice the truth. And embrace the truth. When we pick and choose what is convenient for us and what is easy for us. We have created a Christianity that is no longer Christian. It's a subculture of Christianity that helps us with our life. Our existing life. The life that we had before we met Christ. Christ just helps us. So that we can be happier. Safer. Live longer. Healthier. But it's not a new life. Because it is not a surrendered life. Do we actually believe that all this is going to be gone? That we're just sojourners just passing through? There's a reason why he tells us to watch out and stand firm of the scheme of the devil. The scheme. When we think of evil we think of Hitler. We think of mass murderers. We think of rapists. We think of things that you and I cannot imagine doing. But the devil is much more clever than that. He uses the term scheming because when he is effective we don't know. When there is malware when you have people who are targeting you to get money that they don't deserve spam doesn't come with red lights. Spam doesn't come to try to get you to click so that they can take your information and rob you of money. It comes in a friendly form. Hey John. Hey Peter. I have something for you. And it tempts you so that you click it. And when you've taken the bait you've succumbed. That's why he uses the term scheming. Scheming that tempts you cause you to click. Cause you to go down that path and next thing you know you're being compromised. And you have a form but there's no power. The biggest hindrance to the power of God in a Christian's life is himself. It's not your neighbors. It's not the community. It's not the people around you. It's yourself. Ourselves. And so we are encouraged and warned like Paul says to Timothy don't entangle yourself in civilian affairs. So that we may please our commanding officer. Meaning that we're at war. We're at war. There's souls at stake. There's people who are lost. Under the power of darkness. So a Christian cannot live as if he doesn't know that. Christian cannot make his greatest priority the length of his life. A Christian cannot live his life with his greatest priority the safety of their own children. A Christian who's opened his eyes to know the reality of heaven and hell can no longer in his right conscience live as if that's not real. Either you believe that and you give your life to spread the gospel. To save lost souls. Or honestly confess that you don't believe this. Be honest with yourself. Confess you don't believe it. I don't believe it enough to give up my life. I believe enough so that I can go to church and be a good Christian, cultural Christian. Not enough to take up the cross. Not enough to lose my life that I may find it in Christ. There's no different levels of Christianity. Either we believe or we don't believe. Are we living as if we're in war? Are we praying like we're in war? Are we desperate like we actually have an enemy attacking us? Are we crying out to the Lord? Because we really believe that these souls are headed to hell. Or have we been blinded by cultural Christianity? Because that's all you see around you. So it has become normal to be dull. It's become normal to go through the motion. But it's not real. That's not real faith. We need to pray because there's a battle going on. We need to pray because many of us have succumbed to the scheming of the devil. We've already succumbed to it. We need to pray that God would open our eyes so that our faith is real. That we don't repeat cultural Christianity. I guarantee you one generation that lives cultural Christianity next generation is apostasy. Apostasy. That's a proven observable fact in Christian history. If you accept cultural Christianity as your norm the next generation will walk away from their faith. I want us to pray with a sense of urgency. With honesty. Don't sit in your chairs and pray because it's time to pray. So that you can say that you prayed. Pray because you're desperate. Pray that God would open your eyes so that you can see what he sees. That he had compassion for lost souls. Imagine the compassion of our father. That he would send his only begotten son to suffer for people who would crucify him. Imagine what he must have been feeling. Imagine what he must have seen. Imagine how desperate we must have seen to him. That the only path of salvation was to have his son suffer in his hands. That you and I may have this life. And then imagine those same people who sing the songs and praises of what he has done and then live like the rest of the world. Imagine how he must grieve. Imagine how he must ache. Imagine how he must hurt. Imagine how he must be angered by an apathetic church who has held on to a form of godliness with no power. Pray with me. Cry out with me. We are more desperate than we know. You may not see the consequences of it tomorrow or the next month but eventually you will see the consequences. You will see the consequences. If we continue to have a heart that is cold. If we continue to play around with the things of this world. If we continue to hold on to form without real worth. Eventually you will see the effects of it. Maybe not tomorrow maybe not next month but you will see it. In your next generation. In the church. As I mentioned before we go into prayer. Jesus warned the church. I have this against you. I have this against your first love. He said if you do not turn if you do not repent I will take away your lamp stand. The lamp stand is the church. That doesn't mean he is going to shut the doors. Doesn't mean that the name community church isn't going to exist. But we would no longer be useful to the kingdom. And I want you to imagine even if it's just for a minute that we decided to shut this church. Starting this Sunday there is no Berean community church. There is no bible study. There is no college ministry. There is no retreat. What will you cling on to? What would Christ mean to you? What would you believe? Would you still pray? Would you still study the bible? Would you still evangelize? He said that a church that is no longer passionately in love with Christ is a church that is no longer passionately in love with Christ. In his eyes it is no different than a church that has shut down. We are not responsible because you and I do not have the power to turn sinners from their sins. But he did warn us that if I tell you to tell a sinner that his judgment is coming and I'm telling you to warn them and you do not warn them and they do not turn that sinner will be responsible for his sins but you will be responsible for your callousness. For not telling them. But if I tell you to go tell a sinner to turn from his sins and you warned him and they didn't respond so that sinner will be responsible for his sins but there will be no guilt on you. Let's take this challenge seriously. Our church is growing.  He didn't send us here just to grow. We didn't establish this church just so that we can grow. This church is here because we need to be a light in this dark world and not just in Irvine. The world. I need our church to commit to Christ. We need this church to commit to Christ. We cannot stay open if Christ is not our passion. If Christ is not our love. If Christ is not our Lord. Because we're just playing a game. Pray with me. We are far more desperate than we think. This is far more urgent than you think. We are far more vulnerable than we think. Your children are in far more danger than you think. We need to pray. We need to pray with urgency. Pray as if our life depends on it. Pray for the lost souls. This evening I'm going to ask you to pray. And I'm going to ask you to pray for someone very specific. That do not know Christ in your life. Don't just pray a peppered prayer. Lord, save this person. Save my mom. Save my dad. Pray as if they're on their deathbed. And this is it. Seek him with all your heart. Pray. Commit to fasting. Pray. Pray with urgency. I want you to think of someone in your life that you love who do not know the Lord. That may be your children. It may be your mom. It may be your dad. It may be your sister. It may be your brother. It may be a cousin. It may be a co-worker. But somebody you genuinely care about who does not know the Lord. And plead on their behalf. Because they don't know how to pray. Because their eyes have not been open. They don't know the danger that they're in. They don't know the love that is waiting for them. So they cannot pray. But that's not you. That's not you. So let's pray specifically for them. After you've prayed for them, ask the Lord to open your eyes. And to pray for those who you may not love. But that God would give you enough love to pray on their behalf. Pray for the souls that you met out in Korea. Pray for your co-workers. That you have compassion for. And even beyond that, ask the Lord to soften your heart to pray for strangers. Pray and plead on their behalf. Knowing and believing you know what is waiting for them. And then, pray for those who you do not want to pray for. Pray for those who have hurt you. Pray for those who you've been bitter at. Ask God to give you the strength and the love enough to pray for those that you've been resisting. And to really pray. So this evening, I want to challenge you. Don't just casually pray. Don't just put in the time to pray. Don't just go down a list to pray. Figure out figure out the urgent things. And plead. Don't just ask. Beg. Plead. Pray out. So that our God knows how important this is to you. Pray in such a way that when God hears our prayers that He knows how desperate you are. Pray in such a way where He understands how important this is to you. And a God who promised and said, "If you abide in my word, I'll abide in you." Ask whatever you wish and it shall be done for you. And cling to that promise and pray. That we may see the power of God. That God would deliver us from a form of godliness. That we may participate in His power. So I'm going to pray for us. I'm going to give you time to pray. And you can spread out if you want. You can pray with other people if you want. If you need someone to pray for you, then you can come up and we'll take some time to pray. But please do not pray casually. Pray with urgency. Let me pray for us and then we're going to have the music just kind of play. And again, like I said, if you are sitting somewhere where you're self-conscious about what other people are going to think of you if you pray, then get out of there. Go somewhere where you're not going to be distracted and pray. Heavenly Father, we want your glory, not the praise of men. We want true peace, not just a safety net. We want true life, not just superficial happiness. We want true hope, not just wishful thinking. Help us to see the weightiness of what it is that you've given us. Help us, Lord God, to see that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, that we are in spiritual battle. If we've been entangled in civilian affairs, Lord, deliver us. If we've been coveting the world more than coveting your grace and love, Lord, deliver us. Lord, if we've succumbed to the scheming of the devil, open our eyes, Lord God, that we may cling to you and flee the devil. Help us to be a church that isn't just known for studying the Bible, but is known, Father God, for men and women who pray, who pray desperately. Help us, Lord. The harvest is plentiful, yet the workers are so few. Raise up true workers for your kingdom. Help us, Lord God, to pray. In Jesus' name, amen. Help us to move our chairs, if you can help us to move all the chairs. And then again, we're going to take some time to pray. And then in about 15-20 minutes, I'm going to invite those of you who want prayer to come up and pray together.

This is my wife Claire. And as many of you may know, we have a four-year-old son, Asher. So about less than two years ago, my wife Claire, she started to have a stabbing pain on her chest. And we did a lot of tests, but did not find anything until about last September. She started to have, like, an extremely severe back pain, and we went to a lot of tests. And later that day, last Thanksgiving, we find out she has a tumor on her chest, which caused her to have a spine fracture. So since then, we went through a lot of rounds of chemo and radiations. And recent tests show--SCAM shows her tumor continues to spread. So she will start her new clinical trial next Wednesday. And we are so grateful that since then we received so many prayers and help and support from church brothers and sisters. Recently, my wife, she read the Gems, Chapter 5, and she see the power of prayer or faith from righteous persons. So we humbly and boldly ask for more prayer today. We ask for prayers, like, first, to have God be glorified through this, and for us to be a good testimony for his love and grace, and secondly, to keep us continue to have peace and joy from God in any circumstance, and to protect from losing hope or anything like that, but instead to continue to have thanks and praise to the Lord, and to always remember his word that there's nothing too difficult to the Lord, and last, to pray for her complete healing and protect her from all the side effects that we don't know. Thank you. I feel I'm unworthy to sit here and share, but recently, Lord has taught me that we as Christians should not hide, but be light to the world and around. So I think I should step out of my comfortable zone. During the sickness and treatments, there are many--to be honest, I experienced a lot of closeness and God's presence. I'm so thankful, and there are many peaceful moments. Majority of the time, I feel very peaceful, that when I can sincerely boast in Christ and sing, "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not disappearing, persecuted, but not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed, because I have the most treasure in my earthen container." There are also times when I can do nothing but cry out to Lord, "Please do not cast me away from your presence. Do not take your Holy Spirit from me, because I am scared and I am so in need of you." There are times I confidently proclaim that I belong to Christ and the evil has no power on me. There are times, like last night, when I cannot stop coughing for hours to get some rest. I can only let the tears down and whisper in my heart, "Are you still there? Please help me. Please save me from this darkness." I quickly repent and confess my unbelief. I know God is my portion. There is no Savior except Him. Sometimes I feel, I feel in so many ways, in the disease, my physical health, my planning and ability to do things, and even my accountability to others. Sometimes I just feel everything is still fine. I can laugh, plan and do things, especially for my lovely kid, and celebrate each day before Lord. I am weak. I am sick. I really pray and hope and plead and cry to the Almighty and mercy for God to save me with His divine healing thoroughly and speedily. But I also am very grateful. There are so many things to testify and glory God in each step. I still trust in Lord. I know our God is good. And His thoughts toward us and me is thoughts of peaceful. And Christ is my perfect Savior that can save me from both things and sickness. I shall still praise Lord regardless of anything. And actually praise brings me a lot of strength. I need your help and many prayers because the Bible tells us the prayer of faith shall save the sick. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man alleviates much. At last, I hope to end this sharing with Psalm 27, verses 1. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Who should I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life. Whom should I dread? Praise the Lord and thank you all for your prayers. Before we pray, you know whenever we pray for someone who is sick, especially as sick as Claire is, there's always this reluctance that what if we pray and God doesn't answer? And so as a result of that, we kind of have a tendency to pray and covering just in case. When we pray, we pray with confidence because we are assured of two things. One, that our God is capable, that our God is powerful. For God to heal this is nothing to Him. He who did not spare His own Son, how will He not along with Him give us all things that are necessary? And so one, we know that God is more than capable of moving mountains if He desires. That we know for sure. Two, we know He loves her. We know He loves Khan. We know He loves Asher. That we are confident in. And so when we pray, we pray with confidence that He is able. We pray with confidence that we are praying for somebody that He loves. And that whether He answers or not, we are in a place where we can plead. We want this. Right? We want this. We want this to be His will. We desire this to be His will. And so in the end, God hears us and what He does with that, that's up to Him. But when we pray, we pray with confidence. Right? Because we are praying to a God that if it is His will, that He can. And we want this to be His will. Right? So we are going to pray for them. And first of all, I want us to all pray collectively before I pray. Before the elders lay hands and pray for her, I want all of us to take a few minutes collectively. Not only is the prayer of righteous people like this God answer, but He also hears the prayers of the cries of the church. And so we are many in this room, so let there be many crying out on their behalf. This young family with a young child at home. And every single one of you who has a child at home, you know. You know how urgent this prayer is. So let's pray. Okay? Take some time to pray. And after a few minutes, if I can ask the elders to come. And we are going to lay hands on Claire. Lay hands on her. Okay? And after about a few minutes of praying, right? And then afterwards, about 3-4 minutes, then I am going to lead us in prayer. And then our praise team is going to come up and we are going to close out the night. Okay? Let's pray.      Father, we thank you that you have given us a church community. We can come around, Father, this young family with Claire. Lord, you know that they have been wrestling with this for so long. And I know that they are fatigued, they are tired, they are scared. Lord, I pray that you would hear our prayers collectively. That you would hear our crying out. That this precious sister, Lord God, is in need of your healing. Lord, I pray that this would be an opportunity to show your glory. Your power, Father God, that our faith would be strengthened because of her. That our whole church, Lord God, would have greater faith, Lord God, because of your healing upon this sister. I pray, Father, we know that you are more than capable. Lord, if you have been waiting for us to pray collectively, to cry out to you. Lord, we are crying out to you now. Lord, I pray for her, I pray for her husband, Con, I pray for Asher. Lord, as you love them so much that you gave your only begotten Son. That you didn't even spare your own son, Lord God, for them. So how much more, Father, we believe that you desire what's best for them. Lord, you told us to pray in faith without doubt. So we pray, Father God, that you would bring healing, demonstrate your power. That we would celebrate and worship and honor and glorify you. Strengthen their faith, Lord God, that they would not be tired. That they would not be weary. I pray that all that you have promised in your scriptures, Lord God, will become a reality and not just wishful thinking. And so we lift her up to you, Father God. We lay hands, Father, because we desire this collectively as a church. We cry, we beg, we plead together, Father God, for healing that only you can give. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray, Amen. Amen. So I pray that you continue to pray for her and her family. So if you can all stand up with me for our closing praise.  As we sing this last song, "Abide," as we've been so encouraged, we know, Lord, we know that we are unable to sustain ourselves. That it's through Christ and through him alone that we are able to abide. So as we sing this song, I pray that it may be not just a song we sing, but a prayer as well.   For my waking breath, for my daily breath, I depend on you, I depend on you. For the sun to rise, for my sleep at night, I depend on you, I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. When the spirit leaves, as I'm falling, I depend on you, I depend on you. For the victory's still in front of me, I depend on you, I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Be my strength, my song in the night. Be my all, my treasure, my prize. I am yours forever, you're mine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. When I pass through death, as I enter rest, I depend on you, I depend on you. For eternal life to be raised with pride, I depend on you, I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Be my strength, my song in the night. Be my all, my treasure, my prize. I am yours forever, you're mine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Be my strength, my song in the night. Be my all, my treasure, my prize. I am yours forever, you're mine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Let's pray. Father, you're so good. You're gracious to us. You've shown your love towards us. You continue, Lord God, to show your faithfulness to us. Lord, help tonight not be a night that we pray urgently, Lord God, but may it continue throughout the days and months and years as you establish this church. Help us, again, see the world as you see it. Help us to have spiritual eyes, spiritual wherewithal, Lord God, that we are in the midst of a battle, a spiritual one. And the way, Lord God, that we participate is through spiritual means. So I pray, Lord God, for strength for each and every one of us to rely on your spirit's power to sustain us, to move us forward individually and as a church. God, we pray for your name to be magnified, that the light of Christ may be shown brightly through each and every one of us who call you Lord and Savior. Again, Lord God, do almighty work for the magnification of your name. Provide healing, provide strength to those who need healing, especially for our sister class. Lord God, we know that you are a God who is good, and we trust that you will do good things in your timing, in your ways. Just help us, Lord God, just to be tools in your hand to honor you and give you the glory, the majesty, the honor that you're due. Again, be with us, Lord God, as we depart. Strengthen your church the only way you can. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
