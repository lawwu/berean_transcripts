mentioned in the scripture that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1013s">00:16:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">don't typically pay a lot of

dragon, there's all these different things that are being presented in the scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1030s">00:17:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that we kind of vaguely know, but we don't really understand the spiritual realm.</span></div><div

God of heaven, earth, and under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1047s">00:17:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the earth, meaning that there's a, there's all of this is God's creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1053s">00:17:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That it's not just a

real than this because once we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1064s">00:17:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">die, we're going to be in

again, I think it's interesting for us to think about all this because there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1073s">00:17:53.360</a></span> |

href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1080s">00:18:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we should because it's there for a reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

fulfilled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1516s">00:25:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">through Christ, it was literal.</span></div><div

was going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1526s">00:25:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to betray Him, He was going to ride on a donkey, He was going to be nailed on a tree, the leaders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1531s">00:25:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to betray

much of that was word for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/224027392#t=1538s">00:25:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">word fulfilled.</span></div><div
