So I will not fear, for this truth remains, that my God is the ancient of days. None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hands, for His throne it shall remain and ever stand.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Not by my earthly wisdom, the grace of life without a stain was treated for the sake of life. By grace I am redeemed, by grace I am restored, and now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.</p><p>Let praise rise up and overflow, my song resound forever. For grace will see me welcomed home, to walk beside myself. By grace I am redeemed, by grace I am restored, and now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord. I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.</p><p>By grace I am redeemed, by grace I am restored, and now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord. All right, good morning, welcome to Breen Community Church. A few announcements. First of all, if you are part of our singles ministry, the band ministry, the Christmas party for you guys are happening on December 20th at 5pm.</p><p>That's a Sunday in the sanctuary at 5pm. So if you are planning to come, please sign up for that. It is a potluck gathering, so you will need to sign up and sign up for the potluck as well. And then, women's basketball. Some of the ladies asked me how come we didn't announce the WBBA, so we are announcing it now.</p><p>So if you are planning to play, it is happening at the same time on Sundays, starting from January 11th at 4pm. So please sign up for that. And then, again, you must be a member to be able to participate in that. And then finally, Breen Missions t-shirt fundraiser. So we made announcements a few times about that.</p><p>The fundraiser table for the shirts will be set up outside. So as you go outside, you will probably see a table. And you can sign up for it. I don't think they have the t-shirts yet, but if you sign up for it, it should be coming soon. And the cost of it is $30, and the proceeds are going to help the members of our team that are going to South Korea and India coming up in January.</p><p>Okay? Alright, so let me pray for the offering. And again, if you do have a physical offering, we have an offering box in the back that you can visit on the way out. Alright, let's pray. Father, I pray for your continued grace and love that you pour upon us.</p><p>We pray, Father, for your Holy Spirit to lead us, that we may worship you, Father God. Undistracted in whatever it is that we have been entangled with and cause us, Lord, to have our minds be focused on. I pray that you would direct our path toward you, our thoughts, our will, our praise, that it may all belong to you.</p><p>We pray, Father God, that you would bless this time, bless the offering that we give. May it be given joyfully, bountifully. And we pray for wisdom and your grace, Lord God, to be able to handle it in such a way that greater honor would come to you. We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray.</p><p>Amen. Thank you. Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue. Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to do. Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to do.
