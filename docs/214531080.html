href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=155s">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">same in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=158s">00:02:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's point one, and we're going to take some time to talk about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=161s">00:02:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The point two is the gospel that he is declaring was always meant for the world and not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=167s">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=189s">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to argue in this text, is that the God of the Old

an era where, not just during an era, but in a place of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=207s">00:03:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the world where the New Testament is probably about 95% of the preaching and the teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=214s">00:03:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that you hear in our generation in this particular part of the world is primarily coming from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=221s">00:03:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that in and of itself is not a problem, because the New Testament is also the Bible,</span></div><div

Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=232s">00:03:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=234s">00:03:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a tendency to kind of gravitate toward the New Testament because we superficially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=239s">00:03:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think that the God of the New Testament is an easier

they'll talk about certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=248s">00:04:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">verses that are being quoted in the New

<span class="t">But whenever they come to the Old Testament, they always mention about stoning homosexuals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=265s">00:04:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or if they're disobedient to parents, there's capital punishment if you don't obey the Sabbath</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=271s">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, because the Old Testament, at least on the surface, seems like it's a more difficult</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=278s">00:04:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot harder to explain the God of the Old Testament, so our tendency is to gravitate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/214531080#t=283s">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">toward the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
