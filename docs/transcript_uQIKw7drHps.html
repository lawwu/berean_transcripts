(audience chattering) We're gonna get started in about 30 seconds. (audience chattering) (audience chattering) All right, I'll go ahead and pray for us, and then we'll get started with our last Bible study for this year. Let's pray. God, we just thank you so much for your faithfulness, especially just over the past several months here as we studied your word through Galatians. God, there's so much theology, so much just head knowledge that we've gained, but I just pray, Lord, would you remind us that ultimately that you, just a holy, perfect God, humbled himself from glory to rescue us when we were completely hopeless in our sin. But not only that, Lord, by grace, you've elevated us to be heirs with Christ as your children. So, Lord, we just pray that this praise that we lift up to you would not only be a reminder of your grace, but also just a reflection of our hearts just filled with gratitude and joy and peace, God. So, God, would you just glorify your name and your name only, and I just pray all this in Jesus' name.

Uh, what do I push? Boop. Okay. And I'm gonna, for extra context sake, I'm gonna pull it back a couple verses. So we're gonna start at verse 22, okay? "But the scripture has shut up everyone under sin "so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ "might be given to those who believe. "But before faith came, "we were kept in custody under the law, "being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. "Therefore, the law has become our tutor "to lead us to Christ so that we may be justified by faith. "But now that faith has come, "we are no longer under a tutor "for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. "For all of you were baptized "into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. "There is neither Jew nor Greek. "There is neither slave nor free man. "There is neither male nor female "for you are all one in Christ Jesus. "And if you belong to Christ, "then you are Abraham's descendants "and heirs according to the promise." Um, so here are the questions that you did probably hit upon in your preparation, okay? 'Cause remember, I mean, this is the last one, but we're coming to share rather than coming to learn, okay? But these are the questions that I'm hoping that you share in the process of going through the verses. The first one is, "What does it mean to be baptized into Christ?" Okay? And then, "To have been clothed with Christ." And hopefully you found some cross-references. I'm not sure how deeply you went into the baptism, but hopefully that is something that you covered. Three, "What is the purpose of the phrase male nor female?" There are other dualities here, but this is just one that kind of came to my mind. What is the purpose of that phrase? Four, "What does it mean to be an heir "to the promise of Abraham?" And then as a bonus question, I added number five. "And if you have time, "what is the one thing that stuck out to you "in the study of the first half of Galatians?" The chapters one through three, there are 75 verses. Chapters four through six, there are 74 verses. So it's almost split right in half. So what did the first 75 verses, how did it feed you? Okay? So that's what we're gonna be going over. And at 8.10, we'll reconvene and we'll do our final wrap-up session. Okay? And let me pray for us and then we'll dismiss. Lord, we are so thankful that you give us your word and your truth. And we know that there's only one interpretation of all the scriptures that is correct, and that's yours. So I pray that we would grow in the ability to land on conclusions that are as close to your interpretation as we can possibly get. So give us insight, give us skill, illuminate our minds. But more than that, would you illuminate your words into our hearts that it would leave an indelible impression on our lives. And so I pray that you would feed us tonight, help us to serve well through the feeding, to live well by the life that we draw from it. And would you grant each and every table and each and every home group just great insight into your truth and pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
