He lived a perfect life. He died upon a cross. Then he rose from the dead. Now he is in heaven, seated on his throne, at the right hand of the Father, where heaven is his home. We praise you, Jesus, Son of God. We praise you, Jesus, Son of man. You left your throne of grace to suffer in our place. So we praise you, Jesus Christ.  Jesus came to earth.

Merry Christmas!             It will be called Wonderful Cancer.    Away in a manger, now and for a bed, the little bird Jesus lay down his sweet head. The stars in the sky looked out where he lay, the little bird Jesus asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes. The little bird Jesus, the crying he makes. I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky. And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh. Behold the star, behold the star of yonder. Behold that star, this is the star of Bethlehem. The world's my roof, I'll take the air. This is the star of Bethlehem. For him shall watch my feet from sky. This is the star of Bethlehem. Behold the star, behold the star of yonder. Behold that star, this is the star of Bethlehem. The wise men came from the east. This is the star of Bethlehem. To worship him the prince appeared. This is the star of Bethlehem. Behold the star, behold the star of yonder. Behold that star, this is the star of Bethlehem. This is the star of Bethlehem.</p></div></body></html>
