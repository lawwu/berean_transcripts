judgments, what's the first one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=141s">00:02:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The seal judgments,

beginning of the seal judgments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=146s">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you see?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=151s">00:02:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The four horsemen, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=152s">00:02:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And each one of them representing different judgments of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=157s">00:02:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But the seal judgment primarily is an introduction where the Lamb of God, remember it begins</span></div><div

then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=168s">00:02:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lamb of God shows up, and because of his righteousness and sacrifice, that he's able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=175s">00:02:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to open up the scroll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=176s">00:02:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one by one, the scrolls are being opened up, and that's the judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=180s">00:03:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first seven seal judgments is the initiation of the judgment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=185s">00:03:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have the second set, the trumpet judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=190s">00:03:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember we talked about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=191s">00:03:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the trumpet represent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=195s">00:03:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like warning, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=197s">00:03:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're in the army, or if you're in the context of battle, or maybe if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=201s">00:03:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">were wandering in the desert, you don't blow a trumpet before somebody goes to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=206s">00:03:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You blow the trumpet to wake people up, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=209s">00:03:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the trumpet judgments, each one of them is kind of serves as a warning to the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=215s">00:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that the real judgment is what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=218s">00:03:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The bold judgments, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=220s">00:03:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So each one of the seven trumpet judgments is kind of a preparation to kind of sober</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=225s">00:03:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people up and saying, "This is coming," so that it wouldn't catch you off guard, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=229s">00:03:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for the Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=230s">00:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's the seven judgments of the trumpets to prepare, and then the final bold judgment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how would you describe the bold judgment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=239s">00:03:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The wrath, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=240s">00:04:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They were all wrath of God, but the bold judgments are the final, complete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=246s">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of the other things were warning that it was coming, and then finally it has come,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=251s">00:04:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=252s">00:04:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember in the previous passages where there's promises are made that he's no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/238342925#t=256s">00:04:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to delay, meaning that the final judgment is going to come, the end is
