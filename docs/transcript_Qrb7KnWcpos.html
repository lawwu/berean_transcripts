What is this? Yeah. They're earbuds that you can hear yourself. So awesome. Is that fine? Yeah, that's fine. How many points did I actually get off that? Yeah, I mean, it's not-- I don't know how to-- I'm going on my dad. He doesn't need it. I got it. I'll take it. He already doesn't need it. It'd be nice to use for papership, because I print all my videos. Yeah. It's nice. I don't have to waste paper. Or it's a hassle to print it out and sort it. Sort it out. It's older. I don't throw it away. I save it. I had it. I leaf through it. I used to save it, but it was like, wait. I used to have a flexible holder. I did too in college. But-- But where did you lose it? It's just too much. You bring it in? Is that your dog? No, I hate to move. Are you sure you're going to be fine?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Hello, everybody. We can go ahead and find our seats. We'll take a couple of minutes to pray to prepare for worship.  All right, let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father, we just thank you for bringing us here tonight. Thank you that we are able to meet as a body to worship you, to study your word together. We know that it's a privilege. Help us to come with worshipful hearts, with eagerness to just dive into your word tonight. I pray, Lord, that as we just go into a time of singing, I pray that these lyrics that we sing to you would be of a pleasing aroma and that you would just give us all strength. And yeah, just bless this time. Would you be honored in your name, and pray, amen.   How I love the voice of Jesus on the cross of Calvary. He declares his work is finished. He has spoken this hope to me. Though the sun at sea is shining, though the war appeared as lost, Christ had triumphed over evil. It was finished upon that cross. Now the curse, it has been broken. Jesus paid the price for me. For the pardon he has offered, great the welcome that I received. Lonely I approach my Father, clothed in Jesus' righteousness. There is no more guilt to carry. It was finished upon that cross.  Death was once my great opponent. Fear once had a hold on me. But the Son who died to save us rose, that we would be free indeed. Death was once my great opponent. Fear once had a hold on me. But the Son who died to save us rose, that we would be free indeed. Yes, he rose, that we would be free indeed. Free from every plan of darkness, free to live and free to love. Death is dead and Christ is risen. It was finished upon that cross. Onward to eternal glory, to my Savior and my God. I rejoice in Jesus' victory. It was finished upon that cross. It was finished upon that cross. It was finished upon that cross.  When the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply come, longing just to bring something that's worth, that will bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. King of endless worth. King of endless worth, no one could express how much you deserve. Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours, every single breath. I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. And it's all about you. It's all about you. It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. Hello. Hello. Good evening. Can we-- thank you, AV team. Just a couple of quick logistical things. It's pretty crowded in here, right? And some of your groups might have a little bit of difficulty hearing each other. So if that's the case, and you kind of want a little bit more space, if you're in the youth group room on the other side, we've moved the home group to the seeds room in the main sanctuary. So the classrooms on the side are actually going to be available for you guys who are over there on the other side. For you in here, if you guys want to just adjust your table a little bit, or even just go to the courtyard to share your discussions-- and I think we can even have about two or three just dispersed in the sanctuary-- by all means, do that. Because we do want to have you guys just really engage in the discussion and not feel frustrated because you can't hear each other. As you guys know, we do have a lot of people now on Wednesday. And so we do want to try to figure out over the next week or so just a better seating arrangement. So we'll try to work on that. But for the time being, if you are really condensed in your area, you guys can move and space yourselves out a little bit. And then we'll talk to the small group leaders, and we'll try to figure out an arrangement in the coming weeks that will accommodate us until December. Is this screen-- I'm going to go ahead and read. It's on here.  - We'll just have to control it from the back. We'll just control it from the back for now. - OK. Can I have the next slide? Yeah. I'm just going to read this. This is your passage. "I am amazed that you're so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel, which is really not another, only there are some who are disturbing you and who want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed. And as we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you have received, he is to be accursed. For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God, or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ." The word gospel is mentioned seven times in the first few verses. And you've got four mentions of it here. And so you're going to notice a few things already just on the screen. But in your small groups for the next 50 minutes or so, I would like you guys to share your-- can you switch to the next slide? Questions and observations that you did from homework. This isn't technically like a school homework. It's something that you prepare because you're coming to share rather than to passively learn. So whatever you prepared from 6 through 10, go ahead and share those questions and observations. And in the process of sharing, you're going to hit this question. What would a distorting of the gospel entail? If you become anathematized, if you become accursed forever, this is a question you need to get right. So what is this? What is the distorting of the gospel entail? And you don't want to draw from personal experience or if you feel like, oh, I've been abused in this way or that. All of those things are not unimportant, but they're not primary to the text. So going through Galatians, what would the distorting of the gospel entail? You want to make as many observations as you can there. And then also, what does it mean to be a man pleaser in the context of this epistle? And I'll give you a hint. It doesn't mean to be like a suck up, someone who's afraid of people. That's not what that means. And hopefully, you gleaned as much. So what is a man pleaser? And so we're going to have you guys go over these things for the next 50 minutes. And then at 8, 10, we're going to re-congregate. If you have adjusted and you've moved somewhere, please be back in your seats right at 8, 10. I like to be pretty sharp, so you'll see me up here at 8, 09. So 8, 10, we're going to get the lesson started. Let me pray for us, and then we'll break up into our groups. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that you've called us here tonight to feed off your word, to meditate upon it, to glean from it. And I pray that every single one of us would leave this place really understanding just how beautiful the gospel is, and with a conviction not only to get it right for our own personal lives, but Lord, that we would be so excited to share it. And so I pray for just your help, help all the facilitators just to facilitate well, help all of us to really engage the text and engage one another as we fellowship over your word tonight. So we pray for your guidance and your protection over each table. And Lord, we entrust this time into your hands. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. I'll see you at 8, 10.
