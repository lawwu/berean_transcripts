Happy Lord's Day and hello as well to all those joining us online. What a joy and privilege for us to gather together outside to worship our God. Throughout history, God's church has been a singing church. Not just singing to God, but singing to each other. As we recently studied in Ephesians 5, 19 to 20, Paul commands the church, encourages the church to speak to each other through hymns, through psalms, making music to each other, singing with gladness in our hearts to God. So that is what we want to do this morning. As you've seen, the words will be on the app, so if you don't have the words with you, it's on the app, so if you want to pull that out, we'll give you 30 seconds to do that. And then we'll begin with the time of worship.

Good morning, Green Community Church. Okay, before we begin, let me first say happy birthday to some of our special people who are at home. We forgot to say happy birthday last week. We have Edison Lee who is turning three this week. Hudson Young, happy birthday. Emma English, turning five. Carol Cho is turning five today. And then Harvey Kim is turning four. Okay, happy birthday to all of you. Sorry we missed some of you guys last week. Hopefully we'll be able to continue this. Before we get started, again, obviously, you know, we kind of had to scramble to get this ready. So don't look at the details. As long as there's enough shade for you, that's enough. Okay, so hopefully we can get the kinks out for next week. We don't know how long we're going to be in this situation. But some people may ask why are we going through all this hassle to be able to meet physically. Hopefully God tells us we can get back together. The corporate gathering of the church should not be so easily removed. In Hebrew chapter 10, 22-25, the passage we're going to be getting to soon says this. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering. The concern we have right now, according to the statistics, the Barna report has come out and they said among the millennials, which would be a large part of our church, over 35% of people who regularly attended church before the lockdown have already moved away from their faith and they're not attending church anymore. That's just the millennials. I know even those who don't fall under that category, many people have drifted away already. Those are people who have physically left it. These are people who were attending church before the lockdown are no longer attending church. 35%. That's a huge percentage. Those are people who physically moved on. Then there is a large portion of people who have spiritually drifted away. There is a reason why the Bible tells us not to neglect gathering together. In Hebrews chapter 10, 22-25, the people were undergoing persecution and hardship was happening and there was serious consequence for their gathering because the persecution was intense. They actually had Roman guards who were looking for Christians gathering, looking for Christian leaders, Christian gatherings so they can put them in prison and obviously cause physical harm in order to stop the movement of the gospel. So because there was tremendous fear, people were beginning to neglect coming together. Obviously, we're not in the same situation where there is a concern of this disease that is spreading and we want to be careful about that. But the physical gathering of the church, the corporate worship should not be something that we should be kind of fold easily. So we want to make sure. That's why we go through all of this because what we do together, it does matter. It is not like -- we go online worship, we hear sermons, we can sing songs. Yes, it is a good replacement when you cannot gather together. But as much as we can, we want to do our best to signify and to gather together because there is spiritual significance and God is honored by that. So even though there may be some risk and we want to do our best to honor the government that we are under. But at the same time, we want the church to understand the high view of the corporate worship. So again, verse 25, not forsaking our own assembly together as it is a habit of some but encouraging one another. All the more as you see the day drawing near. As it becomes more and more difficult to be a church, we are not only preserving our faith but we are active in preserving other people's faith. We are thinking carefully about people who are drifting. The people who are in your lives, in our lives that you know who need encouragement. So right now everybody is in survival mode and waiting mode. But this is the time we really need to engage. Don't wait for the church to say let's do this together. If you have family, friends, brothers and sisters you have known and haven't talked to in a while, it's a great opportunity for us to consider how to provoke one another on toward love and good deeds. There is a spiritual battle going on and self-survival is not enough. This is when the church needs to be sober and think about what is going on around us. That's the reason why we are going through what we are doing. I want to thank you for the time you have spent this week. Again, don't look too carefully. Just enough so we can have some shade and this cool breeze feels so good. I don't know if you can feel it. I can feel it. Actually, this is a good amount. We have enough chairs. But if you are able to come to the 830 service, I know some of you cannot, especially the parents with children, you cannot. If you are of that age group, 1030 is fine. But if you are able to come to the 830 service and there is no reason other than you have to wake up earlier, we will ask some of you to try to come to the 830 service because this service is going to get packed. 1030 is easier. Some people can't go to any other service but this one. We will ask you to come to the 830 service so we can make more room here. We have a couple of announcements. First of all, next Sunday we have our members meeting. Please mark that on your calendar. At 230 after the second service we will have the members meeting on Zoom. Then we have a baptism after our worship. Elise Chen is going to come up and give her testimony after the worship. She is going to be baptized. Then we have our outreach team. I think June is going to come up and give the announcement. You can use this mic. >> Good morning, everyone. Let's see. This is from our outreach team. I actually tried to call Hans and Franz to come and give this announcement. They told me that all of the flights from Austria were canceled. You will have to deal with a less muscular person. Our gospel night which had been scheduled for April but had to be rescheduled because of COVID. We have rescheduled it now. It's Saturday, August 29 at 4 p.m. by Zoom. Please mark that in your calendars. There is going to be a gospel presentation by one of our leaders. Then a Q&A session where people can anonymously text in questions. There is going to be a flyer on our church Facebook page through which we can use to invite people and get the word out. We are also sending out a registration form and asking people who are interested in joining to please register. By that we will send out the Zoom link. Bereans can join too. Everyone is welcome since it's by Zoom. If you are inviting people, we ask that you please join with them. As a friend. Hopefully this can -- as Pastor Peter has been saying, with the kind of spiritual battle that we are going through now and have been going through, this can really be an opportunity for all of us to join in this spiritual battle. Thank you. >> Again, we want to encourage everybody. This outreach was scheduled before the lockdown. They decided to move it online. We have been really encouraged because we have heard so many people from our church who online has been watching and inviting them to watch online. As much as we are excited about this, we are also excited about the fact that we are going to be sharing the gospel. As much as a lot of people in the church, again, the universal church has been struggling being online, there's also been a lot of people who have been very active in sharing the gospel and bringing people online to watch the services. I have heard -- again, I have gotten e-mails from people. I have gotten texts saying I have my roommate or girlfriend online. A lot of that stuff is going on. We want to encourage you that just because what we are doing is different, we don't just watch and wait. We are -- the new opportunities we have to be online, to be active in doing that. You may have family and friends who may not normally come to something physically, maybe because they are intimidated, but maybe more open to do so online. We want you to take advantage of that. We want you to exercise that, be active and prayerful about doing that. Let me pray for us. Right after we will have the time for offering. If you brought a physical offering, the box is to my right and to your left at the door. Let's pray. Gracious father, we thank you so much for your continued love toward us. We know, father, that you are sovereign. No matter how chaotic the world around us becomes, we know that all of this, Lord God, is under your sovereign control. Help us, Lord, to anchor ourselves in Christ that we are not swayed back and forth by every wind of doctrine, every trend, everything that is going on around us. Help us, Lord, God, to know where our life is, our hope, that we may covet the things, Lord God, that are eternal and not temporal. We pray, father, God, that as we have this time of giving, may it be a true sacrifice, true worship in spirit and in truth. We thank you, father, God, and may your grace and your Holy Spirit through your word bless this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.  >> Let us stand together again as we continue worship.</p></div></body></html>
