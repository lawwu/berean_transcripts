of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=223s">00:03:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the seven churches are just in order of this

them anywhere from 30 to 45 miles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=233s">00:03:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">apart from each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=235s">00:03:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the reason why these roads connected was because every single one of these cities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=240s">00:04:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are major cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=241s">00:04:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There was some kind of major trade going on or it has

because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=268s">00:04:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of the largest and its significance and its

href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=300s">00:05:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a discussion as to how do we understand these angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

night, it records that Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/218294103#t=464s">00:07:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was warning them about the false
