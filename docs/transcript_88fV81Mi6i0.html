So you don't realize how much of our singles are serving the church until they're gone. So if things aren't running smoothly, it's because they're not here, okay?</p><p>We're waiting, waiting 'til next week. All right, so this week, the hermeneutics Bible study is starting this coming Wednesday at 7 p.m., and the home groups are also starting. So for whatever reason, if you haven't signed up, please sign up for that. And if you are new to the church and you wanted to participate, we ask you to come to Wednesday Bible study, and Pastor Mark will be able to help you when you come in, and Justin will kind of get you situated in the right place, okay?</p><p>So that's starting this week. Family ministry prayer meeting. If you're part of the family ministry, there is a prayer meeting going on on February 8th, this coming Saturday. Is it this Saturday? Yeah, this Saturday at 9.15 a.m. at the Youth Chapel across the courtyard. So please come to that, and let them know that you're coming.</p><p>And then next Sunday, we have a communion Sunday taking place, so please prepare your hearts for that. If you are a parent of our Sprouts department from kindergarten to sixth grade, next Sunday there is a PTA meeting that's taking place to kick off the beginning of the year. The sign-ups are on the QR code.</p><p>I guess that's up there. And child care will be provided, so they'll need to know if you're coming and how many children you have, and so they can find the right number of babysitters for that, so please sign up for that. Men's ministry fellowship. This is our quarterly men's ministry fellowship that's kicking off on Saturday on February 15th at 9.00 a.m.</p><p>at the fellowship hall. And the purpose of this is to live living life purposefully, and it is kind of goal-setting for the men's ministry, and there will be a talk on that and an opportunity to sit down and to goal-set for not only this year, but kind of projecting in life, and so it will help to do that.</p><p>That's happening on February 15th, not this Saturday, but the coming Saturday. The lunch -- the cost for the lunch is $10, and the final sign-up is next Sunday, and after that, the fee will go up to $15, okay? So if you are planning to come, please sign up prior to that.</p><p>And then we have one last announcement. Our assistant, Helen, is going to come up and give the announcement. Good morning, church family. As the need is increasing, we will be holding a Q&A session on Saturday, February 22nd at 10 to noon. For anyone in our church who may want to know more about autism spectrum disorders or other disabilities which qualify for any services through various organizations, we will talk about navigating the different life stages, and we will have some service professionals from within our church, such as speech-language pathologists, special ed teachers, social workers from the OC Regional Center and the Department of Rehab available to answer questions.</p><p>So if you have a loved one or a student or even are just curious on how you can support a church family with an ASD, you're welcome to join. There will be child care provided, and for any questions, you can contact me at the email indicated in the announcements, and we hope it will be a helpful session and an opportunity to gain knowledge, support, and resources that are available.</p><p>Thank you. All right, thank you. You can sign up for that, and that's happening on February 22nd. Let me pray for us, and again, to give online, and if you have a physical offering, there's a box in the back on the way out. All right, let's pray. Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes toward Christ, to know, Father, that ultimately our help and our refuge is in him. Help us, Lord God, to untangle whatever it is that we have been tangled in this world. Help us to fix our eyes upon Christ, knowing that he is the author and the perfecter of our faith.</p><p>I pray that everything that we do, Father God, will be an overflow of the tremendous grace that you've given us, that our worship may be in spirit and in truth. I pray that this giving would reflect your love toward us and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Let's take this moment just to grieve those around us. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ >> Father, we thank you for your patience with us.</p><p>Lord, we know just how privileged we are. We know the access that we have toward you. Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith, that we would enjoy the privilege of access we have to you, that we may come to the throne of grace with confidence.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, if we have hardened our hearts towards you because we are unwilling to surrender our lives, I pray, Father God, that the preaching of your word, week in and week out, would chip away from that hardened heart, that they also may repent and come to you.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, not to feel safe simply because we're at church or because we've been raised in the church or because we serve in the church. Help us, Lord, to find life in Christ, that we would be a church filled with people who are drinking constantly of the living water, of the living bread, that our love is not simply the gathering of believers, but Jesus.</p><p>Give us Jesus. Give us more of Jesus. Help us to see Jesus. Help us to love Jesus. Help us to worship Jesus. May him and him alone be our refuge and our love and the object of our worship. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Let's all stand up for the closing praise.</p></div></body></html>
