So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=123s">00:02:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we pray that you would help us in Jesus' name we pray, Amen. All right, so if you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=127s">00:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the beginning of the letter in Revelations chapter 1 verses 1 through 8, there's obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=133s">00:02:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">two sections and hopefully you had enough time to look at it before you came. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=139s">00:02:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">any study, and I'm going to say this again, probably as often as I can, any study that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=145s">00:02:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to, you're really trying to glean from, if you just come in passively to listen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=150s">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I guarantee you, you're going to obviously get less. The more you put in, the more you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=154s">00:02:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get out of it. Book of Revelation, I told you this in Isaiah. Isaiah, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=158s">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just kind of casually come in, a lot of that stuff is going to go over your head. You already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=162s">00:02:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know that Revelation is not a book that you can just read casually. You can't just kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=166s">00:02:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of flip through one page and say, okay, I get the gist of it. You really have to wrestle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=170s">00:02:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through what he was saying, where it's headed, in what context of history is he talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=175s">00:02:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or else it's just going to sound like red horse, white horse, you know, black horse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=181s">00:03:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and death and life, and that's basically all you're going to get, right? So I really want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=186s">00:03:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to encourage you. I'm giving you those questions as a pointer, so there's kind of a highlight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=192s">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but I really want to encourage you to go in there and dig. Dig verse 1, 2, 3, 4, and ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=197s">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the right questions, because this book was not meant to be just skimmed over, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=202s">00:03:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think any book was meant to be skimmed over, but this book in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=206s">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he wrote it and revealed to it in such a way that those who are diligently seeking, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=211s">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">searching, and asking, they will find the answers, right? And those who are just casually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=217s">00:03:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's almost kind of hidden. It's kind of like the reason why Jesus spoke in parables. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=221s">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">said for those who have ears so that they can listen, and ask, and search, they will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=226s">00:03:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have to go the extra step to find out what the meaning of the parable was. And he said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=230s">00:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those are given so that revelation may be given to you so you would have a deeper understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=235s">00:03:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. But those people were just casually listening. It's actually hidden to them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=239s">00:03:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">In Revelation, the apocryphal writing is exactly like that, right? If you casually listen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=244s">00:04:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I guarantee you that it will go over your head. So again, this is my encouragement to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=248s">00:04:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you to really dive into this book. And some of the greatest treasures in the Scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=254s">00:04:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are things that are at least superficially hard to understand. But when you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=259s">00:04:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">see what's revealed in it, you're going to find that this will help you to connect a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=263s">00:04:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of other parts of the Bible that you may not, you had maybe had a vague understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=267s">00:04:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of. Okay? All right. So we're going to look at the prologue. The very beginning, it starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=271s">00:04:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to show his servants the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=277s">00:04:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=281s">00:04:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get a little bit deep into that. But the first part of it, everybody have your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=287s">00:04:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">outline, right? Okay. When he says the revelation of Jesus Christ, right? Does this mean the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=296s">00:04:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">revelation about Jesus Christ or revelation coming through Jesus Christ? I just want you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=310s">00:05:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to think. I'm not expecting any answers. I usually don't expect any answers. Right? Is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=316s">00:05:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus Christ, or is it saying revelation through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=322s">00:05:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ? If you read the commentaries, there's, you know, there's pages written on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=331s">00:05:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">why they think it is about Jesus Christ and why they think it is through Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=337s">00:05:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think it necessarily has to be one or the other. The broad outline of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=343s">00:05:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">introduction is going to be about the revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus Christ, and revelation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=349s">00:05:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that is obviously coming through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the author, ultimately the author</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=355s">00:05:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">through the Holy Spirit. So if you look at the first few verses, it will give us a brief</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=361s">00:06:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">outline of how the revelation came to us. The order of the revelation that we see first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=370s">00:06:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">not to Christ, right? Revelation came from God to Christ. I think I got another. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=383s">00:06:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not there. It's actually here. All right. In a few seconds, it'll come up. Okay. I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=400s">00:06:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to read a passage in Amos 3, 7 through 8. It says, "For the Lord God does nothing without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=405s">00:06:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">revealing his secret to his servants, the prophets. The lion has roared. Who will not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=410s">00:06:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">fear the Lord God has spoken? Who can prophesy?" So in Amos and all the other prophets, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=418s">00:06:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">says, before he does anything, he makes sure that revelation is first given. So the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=424s">00:07:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of Revelation basically was not meant for it to be hidden. Right? So a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=431s">00:07:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">think like, oh, the book of Revelation, he kind of wrote it in code so we won't understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=436s">00:07:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That was not the intention at all. In fact, from the very get-go, it says, this was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=440s">00:07:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">revelation. God is intending for us to know what he is saying. But he said it in a way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=446s">00:07:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">where it requires work, it requires seeking him out. Right? So the order of what we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=453s">00:07:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in the revelation is that God revealed through his son Christ. Christ reveals through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=461s">00:07:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">angels and then angels reveals through John. And then in the end, John reveals to the seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=469s">00:07:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">churches. So you can say, in a sense, that God is speaking through these various channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=478s">00:07:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the typical way that God speaks. Again, in certain circles, or maybe even us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=486s">00:08:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we will sometimes say, God told me this, God told me that. But the usual, it doesn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=491s">00:08:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that God can't do that, or that God doesn't do that. But the typical way that God reveals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=496s">00:08:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">himself is usually through his servants. And here he clearly spells out that it is through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=501s">00:08:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, Christ through the angels, angels to John, and then John to the seven churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=508s">00:08:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the questions that I want you guys to contemplate and think about, and I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=511s">00:08:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one of the discussion questions, why does God not reveal all of this directly to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=515s">00:08:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">us? Why does he go through Christ? Why the work of the Holy Spirit? Is the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=523s">00:08:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">only able to do something that God cannot do? And that's why he hires him or gets him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=528s">00:08:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that? Is the Holy Spirit not able to speak to all of us? I mean, the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=532s">00:08:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is also omnipresent. Why does he use these channels to reveal these important things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=538s">00:08:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to us? I'm not going to answer that. I want you guys to think about it. Because this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=543s">00:09:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the typical way that revelation usually comes to us. God uses his particular servants and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=549s">00:09:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">raises them up so that they would go and disseminate this information. He says that the revelation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=559s">00:09:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">came to John to the seven churches. And so the first three chapters we're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=563s">00:09:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at the characters of the seven churches and the meaning of that. So we're just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=568s">00:09:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to touch upon it today. And we're going to dive a little bit deeper into it next time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=572s">00:09:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because next time he's going to go directly into that. But why the seven churches? Why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=580s">00:09:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">not the 30 churches? Or why not the 15 churches? If you know anything about that area, Asia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=585s">00:09:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Minor, how big is Asia Minor? Some of you guys who know the biblical geography. Is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=592s">00:09:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the size of Florida? How big is Asia Minor? Land wise. Just a rough guess. Or you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=606s">00:10:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">no idea where Asia Minor is. I know some of you guys know where Asia Minor is. Remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=611s">00:10:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in Paul's second missionary journey, he was about to go to Asia Minor. The Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=616s">00:10:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">tells him not to go there. And then he crosses over and then he goes to Philippi. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=623s">00:10:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">whole region he said not to go. Basically the size of Asia Minor would probably be about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=630s">00:10:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">two thirds of the United States. It's about a half of Turkey. So if you know the size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=636s">00:10:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of Turkey, Turkey as a nation is huge. Land mass wise is huge. So majority of Apostle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=642s">00:10:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's missionary journeys took place in this area. Right? So he's at the island of Patmos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=650s">00:10:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">across the ocean, which is the short distance on the island. He's been basically banished</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=657s">00:10:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to the island of Patmos for doing work in Asia Minor. But in that whole area, this letter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=662s">00:11:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is written to only seven churches. Now were there only seven churches at the time? No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=669s">00:11:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in the scripture itself, it mentions other places. Like I think I mentioned Troas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=674s">00:11:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Colossae, Hierapolis. I mean there are many other churches that are mentioned that Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=679s">00:11:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">does not mention. So why does he single out these seven churches? Again, we don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=683s">00:11:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the exact answer for that. And again, I had a map but I can't show it to you for technological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=689s">00:11:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons. Okay. But one of the theory is that if you look at the map of the seven churches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=696s">00:11:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it is kind of connected to each other. So the ancient history, or at least the roads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=706s">00:11:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that the Romans built, that every single one of these cities were not small towns. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=710s">00:11:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">were big towns and they were the most heavily populated. Therefore the trades and the commerce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=716s">00:11:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">was very active. So you'll notice that not only Apostle Paul, but all the missionary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=723s">00:12:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">work that is done in the early churches typically targeted big cities. It would make sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=729s">00:12:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">humanly speaking it would make sense because that's where the most concentration of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=733s">00:12:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">were. So if Apostle Paul was to come and preach the gospel, he'd want to preach it to as many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=738s">00:12:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">people as possible. So the early church, in order to maximize their effort, they targeted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=743s">00:12:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">these large cities. So every one of these seven churches that we'll get into when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=749s">00:12:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually dive into those texts are churches that happen to be significant in size because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=755s">00:12:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of where they were. And there were easy roads that traveled between these cities that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=760s">00:12:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans built for that purpose, for business purposes. Okay. So again, this is not a fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=766s">00:12:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but this is again, educated guess, I guess, by the scholars that this is probably the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=772s">00:12:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why these seven churches are targeted. But the number seven also is significant because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=778s">00:12:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever the Bible mentions the number seven, it signifies something perfection. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=784s">00:13:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the seven churches of Christ. And so there's symbolic reason behind a number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=790s">00:13:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">seven, but there's also practical reasons that these churches probably were larger than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=794s">00:13:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">average churches. The revelation from Jesus Christ is given to His servants for the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=805s">00:13:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of revealing it to others. Now that's a question that I proposed to you in the beginning. Why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=809s">00:13:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">was revelation given to John? In fact, it wasn't just John. If you look at the passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=818s">00:13:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "He made it known by sending His angels who bore witness to the Word of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=822s">00:13:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and to His servants," in plural. Right? So he says, "The revelation is given to all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=830s">00:13:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">His servants, but in this particular situation for the churches, it is given to John." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=840s">00:14:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at it, the revelation given to His servant, or in particular John, is strictly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=845s">00:14:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for the purpose of making it known to other people. So when we talk about the good news,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=851s">00:14:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's meant to be spread to those who will continue to spread the news. Right? So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=858s">00:14:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we ask the Christian, if we're coming to God asking, it's like, "I'm just curious. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=862s">00:14:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">just curious to know who God is. I'm just curious." But a typical pattern that you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=868s">00:14:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">see in the Scripture is God reveals Himself to people who are ready to reveal Himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=874s">00:14:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to others. Because that's the purpose of revelation. The purpose of revelation is not just for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=881s">00:14:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">an individual. That's why the Gospel, the term Gospel, the good news of the cross, euangelion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=889s">00:14:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a deliberate use of that word for a particular purpose. Because the Gospel was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=894s">00:14:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">given with the understanding that it's meant to be spread. The Gospel saves us. It is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=902s">00:15:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. First to the Jew, then to the Gentile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=907s">00:15:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Paul says, "First to the Jews," it means that the Gospel first came. The news</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=911s">00:15:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">spread among the Jews because God has been preparing them to receive the Gospel message,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=917s">00:15:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">even from their Old Testament history. Everything about the Jewish culture and their history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=922s">00:15:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and everything that they experienced was for the purpose of the Gospel to come and make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=926s">00:15:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sense to them. And then when Christ came and was resurrected, now He's opening the door</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=931s">00:15:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for the Gospel to go to the Gentiles. So the very significance of what we're doing, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=940s">00:15:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">very purpose of this revelation is not so that we can come and say, "You know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=945s">00:15:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't study revelation. I don't really know what's going on in revelation. So I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=948s">00:15:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">know it. I'm a Christian. So I should know it." That is not the purpose of revelation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=954s">00:15:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course we should know it. Scripture has a completely different meaning when you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=963s">00:16:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">studying it for the purpose of sharing it. Now I have the exact opposite problem. My</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=971s">00:16:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">problem is everything I study, I study for the purpose of sharing. That's my problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=978s">00:16:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So ever since I started preaching, I wrote in the very beginning of my Bible to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=985s">00:16:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that you study this for yourself. Make sure you study this for yourself because my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=989s">00:16:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">natural inclination whenever I study is like, "Okay, this makes sense. This would make sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=994s">00:16:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in Bible study. This would help me to preach the message." But having said that, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1003s">00:16:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">don't study the Word of God with the intention of sharing in the Great Commission, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1008s">00:16:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a huge chunk of the Bible that won't make any sense to you. Even if it makes sense to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1013s">00:16:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you logically, you will never understand the heart of God. Because He's writing these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1019s">00:16:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Why does the church need to be pure?" Of course we want to bring more honor and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1026s">00:17:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">glory to God. Because the whole purpose of the church is to shine His light so that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1033s">00:17:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">world may see who He is and that the world also may come and worship Him. And if our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1040s">00:17:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">hearts and our mind and our intention is not engaged in the Great Commission, the Word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1044s">00:17:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, there's going to be a disconnect from God's intention and you're just going to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1049s">00:17:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">His words, but you're not going to hear His heart. So when we study the book of Revelation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1055s">00:17:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the purpose of the study of the book of Revelation is not so that you can say, "Well, I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1059s">00:17:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">what the black horse is. I figured out what the trumpet is or the bowl is." Right? I guarantee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1066s">00:17:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you you're going to come out more confused. I'm already telling you, you're going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1071s">00:17:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">out more confused if that's our approach. The reason why we study the book of Revelation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1077s">00:17:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is to know Christ. It's going to be a revelation of who Christ is. And because of our knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1085s">00:18:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ, our knowledge of Christ, that it is for us to live soberly, eagerly anticipating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1092s">00:18:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for His coming. And then to encourage other people to remain sober and then bring other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1097s">00:18:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">people to Christ as well. Right? So any Bible study that is disengaged with the Great Commission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1104s">00:18:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is not going to make much sense. It's looking at, you know, like an instruction manual with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1108s">00:18:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">no intent of ever making any furniture. Right? You only look at the manual, you only look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1115s">00:18:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">at that because you have intent of making something. And that's the purpose of Revelation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1120s">00:18:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Revelation was given to Apostle Paul, to John, to all these disciples so that they may spread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1126s">00:18:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And those who heard the message immediately went and told other people. And we're 2000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1131s">00:18:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">years removed, but that purpose is never going to change until when? Until He comes. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1138s">00:18:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Where does it say that? Matthew 24. Right? He says, until the gospel has gone to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1144s">00:19:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">remotest part of the world, until all the nations have heard, then the end will come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1150s">00:19:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So until that happens, in other words, that hasn't happened yet. 2000 years later, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1154s">00:19:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">still hasn't happened yet. Until that happens, until the church is actively engaged in spreading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1159s">00:19:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this news to the remotest part of the world, and every nation, every tribe hears, He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1164s">00:19:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the end will not come. So Revelation is for that purpose. Right? Is to reveal His truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1170s">00:19:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to get us to go and get us to share. It is given to show His servants what must soon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1183s">00:19:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">take place. Now the idea of soon, I'm not going to get too much into this today. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1188s">00:19:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a sense of urgency. Did you catch that? Right? Now you may read that and say, well, I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1193s">00:19:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">understand if they were the first recipient that they thought maybe Jesus was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1197s">00:19:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">come tomorrow. 2000 years later, do we still have that sense of urgency? Is this relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1201s">00:20:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">today? And you can see why some people would read that and say, well, this must have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1207s">00:20:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">written for the first century people. Because it didn't happen soon. So if it was soon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1212s">00:20:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it must have already happened. So we're looking at something that already happened and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1216s">00:20:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">not in the future. Because if it's in the future, how can it be soon? Right? Why would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1221s">00:20:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">there be a sense of urgency if it didn't happen after 2000 years? Yes? I hope you asked that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1229s">00:20:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because that will tell me that you were studying and wrestling with it before you came. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1233s">00:20:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would there be a sense of urgency studying this book? Right? Because the whole purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1240s">00:20:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of this Revelation is to give a sense of urgency so that His people will live with a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1247s">00:20:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of urgency. Right? Whether He comes tomorrow, whether He comes 1000 years later, He is coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1254s">00:20:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? He says to us 2000 years may seem like a long time, but to God, it's a split second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1261s">00:21:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of the way we understand the soon is that everything that needed to happen before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1269s">00:21:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the end is about to come, for the Son of God to come, to live as a human being, to suffer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1277s">00:21:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to die, to resurrect, to give the Holy Spirit, to renew the covenant. Everything that needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1283s">00:21:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to happen for the end to come has happened.

So the question that the readers of Peter was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1293s">00:21:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">asking is that we thought He was going to come right away. Right? If Jesus said it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1299s">00:21:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">finished, why didn't He come right away? How did He answer that? Don't worry, I'm not expecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1311s">00:21:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">an answer. I just want you to think about it. How did Peter answer that question? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1317s">00:21:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody is talking with a sense of urgency. He is coming. Paul says that it is his hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1322s">00:22:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to preach the Gospel. Right? And he is praying that the Word of God may speed with urgency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1329s">00:22:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the early church there was a sense of urgency. How do you and I have a sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1333s">00:22:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">urgency 2000 years later? When the real issues that we are dealing with is getting promotion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1340s">00:22:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">paying our bills, right? Buying a house at the right time. Why would there be a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1345s">00:22:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of urgency? He hasn't come in 2000 years. How did Peter answer that? I'm trying to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1362s">00:22:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">if anybody, anybody is, any hint? I think you know. What did He say? So that more people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1374s">00:22:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">may come to Christ. Right? In essence, in summary, that is what He says. 2000 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1380s">00:23:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of being patiently waiting for sinners to repent to come to Him. So that more people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1385s">00:23:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">can come. So that more of the Gospel may spread to the more remotest parts of the world. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1390s">00:23:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is what He said. He said if He came 2000 years ago, we wouldn't be here. Our parents wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1396s">00:23:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">be here. Our great grandparents wouldn't be here. Right? He said the purpose of His patience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1402s">00:23:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">is so that the fullness of number of people entering the kingdom may be fulfilled before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1408s">00:23:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">He comes. So that sense of urgency to get the Gospel out, whether He came 100 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1412s">00:23:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ago or 3000 years later, isn't any different. Right? Because every generation is responsible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1421s">00:23:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for that generation.

So there is a sense of urgency. So the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1437s">00:23:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">century people who read this, it is urgent for them.

There was a sense of dire need that he is going to come soon, that we need to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1569s">00:26:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that we can. That's why Paul said, "If you are going to run the race, run to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1574s">00:26:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">win, not to just sign up, not to just say, 'I got a number,' but run to win." I say all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1582s">00:26:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of this because that's how this book starts. Right? That's how this book starts. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1587s">00:26:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get into a little bit more next week because he's going to pile it on some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1591s">00:26:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">more. Okay? When he says these revelations have been given, it teaches us that these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1600s">00:26:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">are not random events. It's God's preordained things that are going to take place. These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1612s">00:26:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are not just looking down the future and say, "Oh, I wonder when or how this is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1615s">00:26:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">happen." These are preordained. That's why he is revealing these things. The content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1625s">00:27:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of his revelation is a record of what John heard and he saw. It reveals what he saw and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1635s">00:27:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">heard and not necessarily what he understood. Now keep that in mind. Okay? And I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1640s">00:27:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to put the next one up there so you can just fill in the blanks. Again, typically when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1650s">00:27:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we're reading scripture or any document that's removed from us in our culture, in our language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1655s">00:27:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to contextualize how the early church would have understood this. Right? So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1660s">00:27:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we see these images, we naturally may ask, "Why doesn't God make it clear?" Right? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1669s">00:27:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to us, if we want something clear, we want him to spell it out, write it out, describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1674s">00:27:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it for us. Because you and I live in a written culture where the highest authority in our,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1681s">00:28:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where we live, is a contract. Right? You describe what the contract is and what the details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1687s">00:28:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are. You do your part and this is my part. Right? And then even when we go to school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1692s">00:28:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we primarily learn through written word. We read things that were jotted down, we write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1696s">00:28:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that and then nothing is certain until it is written down and it's signed. How do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1701s">00:28:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">communicate these things to people who don't know how to read? Right? Again, understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1709s">00:28:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the first century, majority of the people, majority of the people in the church did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1715s">00:28:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">know how to read or write. Those of you who've been to India with us, you know, every time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1719s">00:28:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we go, we have to contextualize the things that we say because even the pastors, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1725s">00:28:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say, I don't know exactly what percentage is, but even the pastors, many of them have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1729s">00:28:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not been educated beyond third grade. So even third grade, at least they can read, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1734s">00:28:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some can read and some can write. But if you run into somebody who's sitting there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1738s">00:28:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to understand what you're saying and they've never been taught how to read, never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1743s">00:29:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">been taught how to write, your communication has to be very different. Right? Because a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1749s">00:29:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of times it's not verbal. Right? So our denomination came up with the way to share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1754s">00:29:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel where it involves a lot of play acting. Right? But in our generation, or at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1761s">00:29:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">least where we are, we kind of look at that as like, oh, we're trying to sensationalize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1765s">00:29:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel, we're trying to make it attractive. But if you're talking to people who don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1769s">00:29:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">know how to read or write, that's the best way to communicate. Right? Isn't that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1774s">00:29:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">way we communicate to children? Because they're not able to verbalize their thoughts. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1779s">00:29:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they sing these songs, they're not able to, like, we sing, it's like, oh, well, revelation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1784s">00:29:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we're caught up with God. And a lot of these doctrines have meaning for us. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1788s">00:29:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with children, they don't know. So when we say caught up, we say caught up. Right? He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1793s">00:29:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was resurrected. He's like, you resurrected. So we do all of these things to, so that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1798s">00:29:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kids could see the physical action and they can visualize and say, oh, that's what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1803s">00:30:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">means. Right? So it's an extra step that we take to reveal something important, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1808s">00:30:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to people who don't know how to read or write. Right? So if you see what it says in verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1814s">00:30:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">2 and verse 11, it says that all the stuff that is being written down here are not things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1820s">00:30:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily that he heard. It's things that he saw. Now, it doesn't mean that he didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1826s">00:30:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hear. He also heard. But basically, this is, the book of Revelation is a document of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1832s">00:30:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things that he saw, a vision that Christ showed him of what is going to take place. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1839s">00:30:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't tell us that John himself understood what he was writing. Right? We don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1845s">00:30:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if he understood or he didn't understand because he doesn't explain. He just tells us, he saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1851s">00:30:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus, he has eyes of fire. He has hairs of wool. Right? He has feet of bronze. And we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1859s">00:30:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to see that next week. Right? But he's just seeing a picture. Like Jesus shows him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1865s">00:31:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a vision and he's just writing down what he's seeing. And remember, what he is seeing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1873s">00:31:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in heaven. Right? These are things that are not things that he can readily identify. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1881s">00:31:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you read the book of Revelation, he'll use a lot of imagery and he says, like. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1886s">00:31:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll see that also in the Old Testament prophets. It was like this. It was like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1891s">00:31:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they don't have anything specific. Right? So somebody who lived, let's say, even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1897s">00:31:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">200 years ago. They come to Los Angeles and they start walking and they start describing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1905s">00:31:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what they see. How do you think their description was going to be? You think they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1910s">00:31:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">say, I saw an automobile that runs on gas. Right? And these roads were paved and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1918s">00:31:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">had lines and they had drivers and they were turning left or to the right. Is that how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1922s">00:32:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they would write it? They wouldn't know this. They wouldn't know how to write that. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1926s">00:32:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't know what an automobile is. They don't know what a cement pavement is. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1932s">00:32:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're going to say stone. If they had carriages, they say, I saw like strange carriages that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1939s">00:32:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are taking them down the road. Right? These people were dressed funny and they were very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1945s">00:32:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">fast. Right? So they're going to describe what they're seeing with what they are able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1953s">00:32:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to describe. So Revelation is a written down document of what John saw. He may have seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1963s">00:32:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a nuclear bomb. Right? And he said a third of the heavens disappeared and wormwood and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1968s">00:32:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so many Christians have gone through and studied how wormwood, that's a nuclear center out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1973s">00:32:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in Russia. And so he must have been talking about that. And if you look at it, it could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1978s">00:32:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">be like what would happen that you and I could relate to that can destroy a third of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1983s">00:33:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">earth? It must be the nuclear bomb. We don't know that for sure. But imagine if you've,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1989s">00:33:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the greatest weapon that you had was a spear. Right? And that's the closest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=1994s">00:33:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that you can relate to. And then you see a vision of an explosion and massive hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2002s">00:33:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of thousands of people just being slaughtered all at once. Like how would he describe that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2006s">00:33:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So a lot of the book of Revelation is just him looking down the line and he doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2012s">00:33:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fully understand or he doesn't have the capacity to even explain. He's just jotting down what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2017s">00:33:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he sees. Right? So in some sense it is hidden, but the whole purpose of it is not to be hidden.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2025s">00:33:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually shows him the picture. Right? Now, because you and I live in a verbal society</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2033s">00:33:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where written documents, if you want something clear, you want it written down so I can read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2037s">00:33:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Right? In an oral tradition, your communication, ability to memorize, what other ways would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2048s">00:34:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be a necessity or better way to communicate if you didn't know how to read or write? Songs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2061s">00:34:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Songs. And that's exactly what they did in the early church. They sang the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2067s">00:34:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody ever go to a Jewish synagogue? No reason to, unless you're in a seminary. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2074s">00:34:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you ever visit a Jewish synagogue, about 80% of their worship is just singing. It's from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2079s">00:34:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the tradition that was passed down from the synagogues. So they would basically take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2083s">00:34:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">portion of the Torah and they would just sing it. So it's kind of weird to me. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2088s">00:34:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not like the songs that we sing where it has a beat, it sounds a lot like the music we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2093s">00:34:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">listen to on the radio. It just sounds like chanting. Because they're just reading and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2100s">00:35:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">chanting. So everybody would chant along and that's how they went through scripture. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2105s">00:35:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they would draw. I would think, if there's one skill that I really wish that I knew how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2110s">00:35:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is drawing. Because I think there are certain things that are better drawn, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2116s">00:35:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see, than maybe verbalize. You know what I'm saying? Anyway. So again, the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2124s">00:35:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">why I say all of this as an introduction to the book of Revelation is to give you the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2127s">00:35:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">mindset of where we're going. Right? To give you a picture of why was this revealed in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2133s">00:35:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this way. So that even when things get difficult, just picture yourself watching this from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2139s">00:35:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">first century Jewish man. He's looking at something that may have happened 2,000 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2146s">00:35:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe 3,000 years down the line with all the technological advances. And that's what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2149s">00:35:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing and that's what he's jotting down. Okay? So the purpose of Revelation, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2162s">00:36:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to bless all who reads aloud the words of the prophecy. I put verse 8, but it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2169s">00:36:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 8. Verse 3. Okay? So I made a mistake there. It's verse 3. To bless those who hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2184s">00:36:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and ultimately bless those who keep what is written in it. So obviously we can understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2192s">00:36:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to bless those who read aloud the words of the prophecy, because that was the primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2197s">00:36:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">way of what? Sharing. Right? When they received Paul's letters, somebody had to stand in front</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2204s">00:36:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the synagogue and read it out loud. Right? So it was meant to be read. And then for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2209s">00:36:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to hear. And then ultimately, why do you read it and why do you hear it? Right? Verse 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2215s">00:36:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of his prophecy and blessed are those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2218s">00:36:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hear, who keep what is written in it for the time is near. So the whole purpose of reading,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2224s">00:37:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole purpose of hearing is to what? To keep. Right? So again, this exercise of studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2232s">00:37:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Revelation or any book of the Bible, the ultimate goal is not simply to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2236s">00:37:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know. It's to keep, to walk, to obey. Right? So the purpose of the book of Revelation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2245s">00:37:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not to simply reveal, it's to get us to move. Right? What should be the end conclusion of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2254s">00:37:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing that judgment is coming? Pretty obvious, right? Move. Tell people. Hopefully it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2265s">00:37:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">create a sense of urgency to get out, to bring people to Christ. So that's why he says the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2272s">00:37:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of it is to read, to hear, and to keep. Part B. We talk about Revelation from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2284s">00:38:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ. Now we're going to be talking about Revelation about Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2290s">00:38:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at verse 4, it starts out by saying, "John, to the seven churches that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2297s">00:38:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are in Asia, grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2303s">00:38:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this section, verse 4 to verse 8, basically is a revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2308s">00:38:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. But if you look at verse 4 and verse 8, it begins and ends the same way. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2316s">00:38:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at verse 4 and verse 8. So it begins by declaring God to be who was, who is, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2322s">00:38:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who is to come. Verse 8, "I am the Alpha and Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2327s">00:38:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was and who is to come, Almighty." So you see these as two bookends. Right? Before he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2334s">00:38:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">goes into describing who Jesus is, he reminds the reader of God who was, who is, and who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2342s">00:39:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is to come. And then he concludes it by saying, don't forget that he's the Alpha and Omega.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2347s">00:39:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">He basically has another exclamation mark and he reminds them again of who was, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2352s">00:39:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is, and who is to come. Right? Now why do you think he does that? Think about if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2365s">00:39:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are writing this letter to a group of people who are suffering for the name of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2371s">00:39:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">How would that hit you? In fact, it's not just even the seven churches. They are experiencing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2382s">00:39:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all kinds of persecution. But think about John himself. Right? He's at the island of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2387s">00:39:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Patmos because he was put in boiling oil and they couldn't kill him. And out of fear of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2393s">00:39:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">their gods, the superstition, they basically banished him at the island of Patmos. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2397s">00:39:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">island of Patmos, Google island of Patmos. Right? And I don't know what it looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2402s">00:40:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">today, but if you Google island of Patmos, it's known to be a desolate place where there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2406s">00:40:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing grows. So it's basically you throw your prisoners and people that you don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2411s">00:40:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to execute, but you don't want to hear from, you just put them on that island. So imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2414s">00:40:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">how miserable John was. And I'm absolutely certain there was no medical care over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2420s">00:40:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So probably eating was difficult. I don't know if the Romans left food for them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2424s">00:40:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or not, but imagine how miserable John must have been. John and the people who are receiving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2430s">00:40:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this letter, the first 300 years of the church was probably the most heavily persecuted period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2439s">00:40:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christian history. The first 300 years. And the first hundred years, and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2443s">00:40:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tail end of the 300 years was intense at the very end. But Paul is writing during a period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2451s">00:40:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">when Nero began the persecution where you see all these pictures of Christians being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2456s">00:40:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">dragged into the Colosseum. It was during that period, 65 AD to about 95 to 100 AD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2462s">00:41:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's about the period when Paul is writing this letter. So to them, when you hear that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2467s">00:41:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">your God is and was and who is to come, what would that do for you? Typically when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2481s">00:41:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">suffer, right? What's one of the greatest comforting aspects of our God? That He is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2489s">00:41:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sovereign. Yes? Because everything seems out of control. It seems unfair. What people have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2497s">00:41:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">done, what is happening to you, why is this happening to me? But to know that our God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2502s">00:41:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is absolutely sovereign, that He hasn't lost control, therefore He hasn't lost control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2507s">00:41:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of you, right? It's a great source of comfort. So when He says Christ, before He goes into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2514s">00:41:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Christology of who He is and what He has done, He says the God who is speaking to you, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2518s">00:41:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">revelation that I'm giving to you is coming from who was, who is, who is to come. Who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2523s">00:42:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was? Everything, think about how much time we end up talking, you know, just thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2532s">00:42:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about maybe I should have done this differently. Maybe I should have done that. I should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2536s">00:42:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">trusted Him. I should have just trusted her. And we replay back painful memories thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2541s">00:42:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that only if we did this right, only if we did this wrong. But when we hear that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2547s">00:42:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was, right? Everything that has happened in the past that you can't make sense of, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2555s">00:42:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was. He was God then too. He's not just sovereign today. He was sovereign then. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2562s">00:42:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a child of God, God was sovereign over all that stuff. All the stuff that you can't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2567s">00:42:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that is unraveling in your life right now. I don't get it. I wish it wasn't so. But He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2573s">00:42:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is. Right? I mean He's completely sovereign today. There's nothing that happens that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2578s">00:42:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of His control. No temptation that sees you but is coming to all men. But with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2582s">00:43:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">temptation God will provide a way of escape. Right? Meaning that God is completely sovereign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2588s">00:43:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That He hasn't lost control. God is and He is to come. Right? That everything that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2594s">00:43:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">happening now, our fear of maybe if we don't do things right, maybe it's going to head</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2598s">00:43:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the wrong place and go out of control. God is sovereign in the future. So it's absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2605s">00:43:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">important for us as Christians that our faith in God is firmly planted on His sovereign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2611s">00:43:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">plan, His sovereign power. Past, present, and future. And that's why I believe that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2615s">00:43:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this beginning of the Revelation, the book of Revelation, starts out with Christology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2623s">00:43:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But even understanding of Christology is within the context of God absolutely being sovereign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2628s">00:43:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He was, He is, He is to come. He is the Alpha and He is the Omega. Right? I'm not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2634s">00:43:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to go into it today but everything that is said about God the Father is also repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2638s">00:43:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere else about Christ.

But I'm not going to get into that today for the sake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2642s">00:44:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of time. So I'm going to go through the list of things that He mentions about who Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2651s">00:44:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is.

There's so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2661s">00:44:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we can talk about God. But the first thing that He says, remember, whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2666s">00:44:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you study the Bible, when you see a list of things, the thing that comes on the top usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2670s">00:44:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is there deliberately. It's not just a random list of qualities of Jesus that He just kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2677s">00:44:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of threw out and it just doesn't matter. Typically they didn't write like that. Whenever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2680s">00:44:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">see a list, the first one, two, three, usually has some significance. So why is His faithful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2687s">00:44:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">witness the first thing that He says? One, this whole book of Revelation was about Revelation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2697s">00:44:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about Him. But Jesus Himself said, right, that when He was going to the cross, He didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2704s">00:45:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say I'm going to save people.

Even though that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2712s">00:45:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was going to do, what did He say? It's time to glorify, for the Son to glorify the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2718s">00:45:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Father, to reveal the Father. In Hebrews chapter one, turn to Hebrews chapter one. I mean it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2727s">00:45:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right next door so you don't have to go too far. Those of you guys who know the book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2734s">00:45:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrew, the whole book of Hebrews is Christology, is doctrine of Christ. He begins the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2741s">00:45:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">by saying, long ago at many times in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2745s">00:45:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son. So He breaks into Christology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2753s">00:45:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and He said the reason why Jesus Christ was revealed and did everything was for what purpose?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2759s">00:45:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">To reveal the Father. So He drew near to us to reveal His Father. So He said, He said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2768s">00:46:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">oh you know we can follow you, the disciples said, only if you would show us the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2772s">00:46:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember what Jesus said?

You have seen the Father. So the primary goal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2784s">00:46:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if the Old Testament says of God, His primary purpose in human history is His glory. How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2790s">00:46:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">does He seek His glory? By seeking to save the lost. But His primary thing He says is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2796s">00:46:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to seek His glory. If God's primary thing is to seek His glory, then wouldn't be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2802s">00:46:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">primary thing for Jesus' ministry, first and foremost, is to bring glory to God, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2808s">00:46:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">reveal Him. So there is a reason why the first thing that is mentioned about Christ is His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2814s">00:46:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">primary concern, and this may not sit well with a lot of people, because the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2823s">00:47:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we heard the Gospel, the way that we have grown up learning about Christianity, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2828s">00:47:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">primary purpose of Jesus is not you, and it's not me. That's not His primary purpose. His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2844s">00:47:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">primary purpose is to reveal the Father. Now when He is revealed, we are saved. When He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2851s">00:47:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is revealed, we live, we have joy. But the primary thing that causes all of that is God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2858s">00:47:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When God is glorified. In fact, when we become the center, we actually suffer. So He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2866s">00:47:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He is a faithful witness. His primary thing that we see about Jesus, it causes us to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2871s">00:47:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who God is. He is the firstborn among the dead. John 3, 16 is a passage where it says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2879s">00:47:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son. The word "the only begotten" is "mano genei,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2887s">00:48:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning the only one. So it's not, a lot of people say, "Oh, He's the only begotten Son."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2893s">00:48:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they focus on the begotten, but the purpose of this word is to say that He is primary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2898s">00:48:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He is the only, there is no other like Him. But the word that is used here is "protocol,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2905s">00:48:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which means firstborn, first compared to others who will follow. Meaning, primary identity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2913s">00:48:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ is to be a faithful witness of His Father, to bring glory to His Father. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2921s">00:48:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He is firstborn among the dead. And how did He do that? He was crucified, He was resurrected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2927s">00:48:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And when that happens, Him being the firstborn coming out, reveals the Father, and then many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2933s">00:48:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">others will follow Him to do the same. So if He is described as the firstborn, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2944s">00:49:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">means all of us are second, third, fourth, fifth born. That's the way that this is used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2949s">00:49:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that as He was resurrected from the dead, we will all be resurrected. And so in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2955s">00:49:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some sense, all of us receive partial resurrection because we are saved and we are also being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2961s">00:49:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">saved. So if Jesus' whole existence, or at least the way He described to us in priority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2968s">00:49:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is to be a faithful witness of God the Father in His new life, what is our goal? Obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2975s">00:49:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. Our new life is not so that, "Hey, you have a new life, now go do whatever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2981s">00:49:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want." And people use the Christian liberty and they apply it completely opposite of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2988s">00:49:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus meant. Or at least how it is used in the Bible. Christian liberty is to free us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=2994s">00:49:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from our sin so that we can glorify the Father. It has nothing to do with, "Now it is my life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3000s">00:50:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I can do whatever I want, since I don't have a penalty of sin." Like it is Christian liberty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3003s">00:50:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And anybody who says, "Don't do this, don't do that," is a legalist. That has nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3008s">00:50:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to do with Christian liberty. We are liberated for what purpose? So that we may be bound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3013s">00:50:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in righteousness. He is the ruler of the king. So again, as we are going through all of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3023s">00:50:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to put on the mindset of somebody who is suffering. What would this mean to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3029s">00:50:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">John, who just can't wait to die? Rome is not in control. He is the one, He is the king</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3040s">00:50:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">above the kings. Jesus is ultimately sovereign. He loved us and the way He loved us is He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3063s">00:51:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">freed us from our sins. You notice how His love for us is letter D, not A. Again, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3078s">00:51:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to read more into it than it is, but I think it is worth noting. Because like I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3082s">00:51:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">said, whenever there is a list, there is a list for a reason. Of course He loves us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3087s">00:51:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course He died for us. But His primary is to glorify the Father. What is interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3096s">00:51:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here is a tense that is used. If you look at verse 5, it says, "If any of you lacks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3102s">00:51:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">wisdom, let him ask," where am I? Revelation 5, it says, "And from Jesus Christ, a faithful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3112s">00:51:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">witness, the firstborn among the dead, ruler of the kings of the earth, to Him who loves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3118s">00:51:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us and has freed us from our sins by His blood." So the word love here is in the present tense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3123s">00:52:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and the freed is in the era tense. So it is two separate tense using the same sentence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3129s">00:52:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now significance of that is that proper understanding of it is Christ loves us continuously, meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3137s">00:52:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that His love for us is ongoing, continuous. But the reality of that love specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3143s">00:52:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is expressed through His sacrifice for us, through the redemption. So what brought Him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3152s">00:52:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to give His life for us, ultimately is love. Because love is a constant, but the expression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3157s">00:52:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of that, the era tense basically means something that happened specifically, an event that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3161s">00:52:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">took place that has its effect today. That is the era tense. The present tense is ongoing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3167s">00:52:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">continuous. So the fact that John writes it, or the revelation comes to us in love in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3173s">00:52:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">present tense and freed us in the era tense is significant, meaning that Jesus Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3179s">00:52:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">does not need to save us over and over and over again. Because He loved us when He said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3184s">00:53:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it was finished and we confessed our sins and He forgave us of our sins, it is a past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3189s">00:53:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">event that has its effect today.

Now again, think of it as, if you are suffering under the Roman rule, right?

Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3221s">00:53:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all the power that they had, right?

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3230s">00:53:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">mean they were the superpower. You can't run from them. So He is saying that He is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3234s">00:53:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">King over all the kings.

Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/216348348#t=3657s">01:00:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not the easiest book to study.
