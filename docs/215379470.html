as we're studying through it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=195s">00:03:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be able to glean some of

href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=255s">00:04:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So they actually attempted to kill him, and then he ended up not dying and coming out.</span></div><div

their superstition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=269s">00:04:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They thought that if you try to attempt to

to kill him again, so they ended up banishing him at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=283s">00:04:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">island of

encouragement to John that he probably wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=336s">00:05:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to

of tremendous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215379470#t=349s">00:05:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">comfort to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span
