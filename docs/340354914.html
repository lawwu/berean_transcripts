I started this week thinking I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=569s">00:09:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to cover it all, but I don't want to skim through any of this. So the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=574s">00:09:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that he says in verse 14, and I want to look at these two lines in verse 14 and 15 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=579s">00:09:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">really understand in depth what he is saying. Verse 14, "That though death, that through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=586s">00:09:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">death he might render powerless him who had the power of death." He had to become a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=592s">00:09:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">being in order to make powerless him who had the power of death. So who has the power of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=598s">00:09:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">death here? I mean, it's right here. It's in English. Satan, right? That's what it says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=605s">00:10:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Wait a second. Doesn't the Bible say that God is the author of life? How did death come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=613s">00:10:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">into humanity? As a penalty of sin. God is the one who said, "If you eat of this tree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=620s">00:10:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of knowledge of good and evil, you shall surely die."

If you read this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=632s">00:10:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of the context of all of scripture, you can mistakenly think that the spiritual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=638s">00:10:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">battle is between God who has the power of life, Satan who has the power of death, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=643s">00:10:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we are in this struggle to fight Satan. And then if we are strong, the church is strong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=650s">00:10:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">God wins.

If you see demonic movies, like horror movies, that's kind of how it gets presented,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=662s">00:11:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You have the cross and the Bible and then it hisses and then Satan would come and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=668s">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the devil would overpower the priest and they go back and forth. And obviously this is Hollywood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=673s">00:11:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so typically the demons win.

So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=708s">00:11:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">does it mean then?

Just like Jesus has many titles, and every one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=720s">00:12:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of these titles kind of explains his identity and his work, Satan also has many titles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=726s">00:12:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The first title that we are given of Satan is Lucifer.

And typically when you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=739s">00:12:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of the idea of the devil that you see on, you know, he's sharp, he's ugly, his face</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=745s">00:12:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is melting off, and it's like, my name is morning star. It doesn't fit his name. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=751s">00:12:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason why his name is first Lucifer is because that's how God created him. God created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=757s">00:12:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">him to be a beautiful creature. He was chief among the angels. We see Archangel Michael,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=765s">00:12:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Gabriel, all of them were under the authority of Satan. The Bible describes when he rebelled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=772s">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">against God that he was so influential he took a third of the angels with him, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=776s">00:12:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a third of the demons are in rebellion against this God.

The word Satan literally means an adversary. When he rebelled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=788s">00:13:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">against God, his intent was to go against whatever God is pushing. God is seeking his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=794s">00:13:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">glory and he's seeking it through the salvation of mankind, and he's working day and night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=800s">00:13:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to oppose that. He's the adversary. Jesus refers to Satan as the ruler of the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=806s">00:13:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in John 12 31.

John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=814s">00:13:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">also says in 1 John, the whole world is in the power of the evil one. But ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=820s">00:13:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in 2 Corinthians 4 4 it says the God of this age is Satan.

He is very, very powerful. He is the most powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=835s">00:13:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">angel outside of God.

The word that is used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=852s">00:14:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to describe Satan, the word that is translated devil here is Diabolos. You probably, some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=857s">00:14:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of you guys who know Spanish, you can already tell Diablo, the devil. In Greek, Diabolos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=862s">00:14:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">means the accuser. He's the prosecutor. In other words, when he says that Satan has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=870s">00:14:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">power over death, what he is saying is, as the accuser, anyone who is guilty, he is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=877s">00:14:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">one who stands before God, accusing him of his sin, that leads to death. So when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=884s">00:14:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible describes Satan as having power over death, it means that the accuser has the power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=890s">00:14:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">over the guilty one. And so when Christ comes and he dies and he resurrects and he covers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=895s">00:14:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">us, we are no longer guilty. So he has taken the power of death out of his hands. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=902s">00:15:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">are free. In Colossians 2, verse 15, it says, "When he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=908s">00:15:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">he made a public display of them having triumphed over them through him." He disarmed him, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=916s">00:15:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">there's nothing to accuse anymore.

If you watch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=930s">00:15:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">too many scary movies, you know, typically it creates fear of the demons. Now, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=937s">00:15:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">should be a healthy respect, because they're powerful.

He does not have that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=968s">00:16:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">authority. In fact, every time we see Satan in the Bible, he is under the umbrella of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=972s">00:16:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the authority of God. Remember when Lot, in the beginning of the book of Job, he comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=978s">00:16:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and he wants to test Lot, and he has to ask permission.

He had to get permission, and God permitted him. When Jesus was headed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=994s">00:16:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to the cross, Jesus, Jesus says to Peter, "Satan has asked permission to sift you like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=1000s">00:16:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">wheat, but I have prayed for you so that your faith would not fail." So even when he wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/340354914#t=1004s">00:16:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to attack Peter, he didn't have any authority.
