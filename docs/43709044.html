class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=109s">00:01:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the past weeks, but I decided to take that out because it's getting too much and I feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=115s">00:01:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like you guys pretty much know what's, where the gist of the progression of Mark is going,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=122s">00:02:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so instead of doing that, we just go straight to the outline of Mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=127s">00:02:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Just very briefly, he started off in Judea in chapter 1 verse 1 until 13, and then for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=133s">00:02:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the majority of the Gospel of Mark from chapter 1, 14 until the end of chapter 9, which we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=140s">00:02:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">going to cover tonight, he was in Galilee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=143s">00:02:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 10, we call that the turning point in which there's a pivot where Jesus' ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=149s">00:02:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">begins to focus and go towards Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=154s">00:02:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the concluding part of the Gospel of Mark, chapter 11 until chapter 16, verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=160s">00:02:40.380</a></span> | <span

again, the Gospel of Mark is a very easy gospel to kind of just follow geographically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=171s">00:02:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it gives us at least a little hint when we hear the chapter numbers where Jesus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=178s">00:02:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and where, what he might possibly be doing, and so that's one of the great things about</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=193s">00:03:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There are four withdrawals that take place, and each one has like a marker that indicates</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=203s">00:03:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We cover the first three, the past three weeks, and we're on the fourth one with chapter 8</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=208s">00:03:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 13 until the end of chapter 9, and we notice that in verse 13 he says, "Leaving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=213s">00:03:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">them he again embarked and went away to the

withdrawal away from Galilee to another region.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=225s">00:03:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just a brief outlook of what's ahead with the fourth withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=231s">00:03:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And as

to cover all this stuff, all these important events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=243s">00:04:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very significant, and so we'll try to take some time, and if I happen to run out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=249s">00:04:09.300</a></span> | <span

the focus of his ministry is becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=322s">00:05:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">narrower as he seeks to

his love and care for his disciples and to see how much he wants to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=341s">00:05:41.660</a></span> | <span

immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=375s">00:06:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So without warning, they're embarking on another journey, they didn't have time to prepare,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=380s">00:06:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and so they had no

<span class="t">them wallow in their physical need, but to really use that as an opportunity to teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=406s">00:06:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see that in verse 15, he begins by saying, giving orders to them, saying, "Watch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=412s">00:06:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">out, beware of the leaven of, or the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of

that Jesus is giving to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=422s">00:07:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">disciples, he's not only calling them to watch out, but to also be aware of the Pharisees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=433s">00:07:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=441s">00:07:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically Jesus is warning, warning his disciples in this boat while they're hungry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=449s">00:07:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees, the Herodians, and the Sadducees, or better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=455s">00:07:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if you want to sum it all up, just the religious

double warning to his disciples, the disciples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=472s">00:07:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in verse 16, they say, "They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=476s">00:07:56.740</a></span> | <span

discussed with one another what rising from the dead meant."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2758s">00:45:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And as they kind of talked about what this resurrection means, the three disciples, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2764s">00:46:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they walked down the mountain after this tremendous event, they just asked Jesus, like, "Why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2769s">00:46:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2773s">00:46:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, they open up this question about Elijah, and this question about Elijah is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2781s">00:46:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, not only do the scribes teach this, but the

in the disciple's shoes and you kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2969s">00:49:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of studied Malachi, you're

href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=2985s">00:49:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">two advents of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=3054s">00:50:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyways, basically, the stance that, at least what I see in the Bible, is the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/43709044#t=3062s">00:51:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is that there are two advents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
