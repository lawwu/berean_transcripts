I told you from the beginning that Isaiah is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=136s">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that.

Even historically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=144s">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes He'll talk about something. Remember Isaiah chapter 6 is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=148s">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about the calling of Isaiah? You know, you would think that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">begin at the beginning of the book, but it actually happens in chapter 6. The whole book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=156s">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is like that. He'll just kind of interject thematically where He feels like it's the best place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=160s">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to come in. So if you feel like, "You know, I don't get the flow of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=164s">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Isaiah." Don't worry about it, okay? Just know the chapters that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=168s">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">studying, what is the theme of that, okay? And then hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=172s">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">later on, next time you read it, you'll see a little bit better connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But from the beginning, if you try to swallow or digest too much, you're going to end up not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=180s">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">catching even the smaller stuff, okay? So if you're wrestling with that, don't feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">too bad. Just kind of pay attention to what's in front of you. And another thing I want to remind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=188s">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you is that Isaiah is not one of those studies that if you come in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not prepared, right? If you come in not prepared, just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you skim through it and you don't really know what's going on in the chapters that we're studying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be very difficult for you to catch because I'm not there going to say, "Look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=204s">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 3 and what does that word mean and how it relates to this verse?" Because we're going over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=208s">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">two, sometimes four chapters at a time.

So Israel basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=2234s">00:37:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">took the worship of Yahweh and said, "We're going to worship here." Just like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=2238s">00:37:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pagans do. So they were following, they were worshiping Yahweh, but they were worshiping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=2242s">00:37:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the model of the pagans. And so God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163288567#t=2246s">00:37:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">always detested that.
