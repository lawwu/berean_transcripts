This is not going to be up here so if you have your Bible with you please turn to Ephesians 6, 10 and I'm going to read for us three verses and then we're going to start.</p><p>Ephesians 6, 10. It reads, "Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For the struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places." Let's pray together.</p><p>We are gathered tonight for a very important spiritual exercise and we are here wanting to draw near to you and to have you honored and to commune with you and to intercede on behalf of your saints. Lord, it is our confession that we are weak and this exercise of prayer is not something that is easy or natural, but it is something that we want to do.</p><p>Lord, if you are not leading this time, all the stuff that we are doing is throwing out superstitious and unworthy words. So first, Lord, as we sing, would you soften our hearts, cause us to be grateful worshippers, cause us to be humbled as we draw near to the presence of a holy, holy, holy God, and cause us to long to pray in the presence of your holy, holy, holy, holy, holy Lord.</p><p>Lord, we are here to pray for you.

What are the areas where your spirit is willing and your flesh is weak?</p><p>And this is a spiritual battle in which you need spiritual help from your brothers and sisters in Christ. So share those things. And also in an offensive way, what are the areas that God is really stirring in your heart really to steward His grace, His gifts, and to minister to people, whether it's on a Saturday outreach, whether it's evangelism at work or at school, or whether it's a parent that you're praying for.</p><p>What can your brothers and sisters in Christ receive with you for? So pray for those things. And after about 15 minutes, the praise team will just lead us in a final couple songs, and I will pray, and then we'll finish like that. Okay? So just turn and find some brothers and sisters in Christ with whom you can pray.</p><p>Offensive and defensive prayer requests.

Father, thank you just for providing for us tonight to reflect some and to pray.</p><p>And Lord, our confession really is that we need to learn how to pray better. And perhaps a lot of that is we're not desperate enough. We don't see you as we ought to. And we leave the exercise of prayer just in theory. But Lord, all of us, we do desire to know how to pray.</p><p>And really to beseech you, the Lord of our harvest, to send out workers. And we wanna know how to pray according to your will and the power of your might. So we pray that you would transform us, help us to be a people who lose just any craving for this world.</p><p>And that we really long just to see people come to faith. So we pray that as we continue to keep watch and to do what we can to be sober, we ask that you would really bear fruit in our lives, help us to be a people who abide in Christ.</p><p>And as we go forth from here, I pray that you would help us to diligently and faithfully steward all the resources that you've given us, whether it's time or money or relationships, and help us to steward them with humility, really for your glory. So would you bear fruit in our church?</p><p>And we entrust ourselves into your care. And we pray for a fruitful weekend ahead, just with a great time of worship on Sunday, where you are honored through the preaching of your word and the collective gratitude of your people. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this evening.</p><p>We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen. All right, that concludes just our time of praise and prayer for tonight. Yeah. Good night. Have a good weekend.</p></div></body></html>
