acceptable behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2021">00:33:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, I was beginning to get very disturbed by what I was hearing when I realized that this is what it's like to be out on the street,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2029">00:33:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that a girl who is hanging out on the street is an open target, and she knows that this is coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2037">00:33:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was no sense of remorse, no sense of disgust, it was just a matter of fact that this was the culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2045">00:34:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it began to dawn on me what I was observing prior to going to that, because whenever we saw a young girl come out on the streets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2053">00:34:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because I've seen some girls who were 16, 17, 18-year-old young girls, blonde hair, blue-eyed girls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2060">00:34:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">looked like cheerleaders at their high school, and then I could just see the natural deterioration,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2064">00:34:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because somehow she got hooked on drugs, and then about two, three months later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2068">00:34:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just see her physical appearance begin to change, and they're usually men around them, just hovering around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2076">00:34:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a known fact that if you're out on the street as a young girl, and you don't get connected to some guy as your protector,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2084">00:34:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">basically you're going to get raped, oftentimes maybe gang raped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2088">00:34:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was so disturbed and disgusted by what I heard that after that, I would come out to Tuesday, and we would serve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2096">00:34:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and I would see some of these same guys who was in that huddle eating, but prior to that, every time I would eat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2102">00:35:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, "Oh, these guys have hardship, they're out on the street, and we want to feed them, care for them."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2107">00:35:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I really had to fight off my disdain for some of these guys, that this is what they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2115">00:35:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was normal for them to be able to do that, and as we're feeding them, as we're trying to share the gospel with them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2122">00:35:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to fight this desire to do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2128">00:35:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And after that, I had to make a rule that the younger girls who were coming out with us, that they're not allowed to leave our little circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2136">00:35:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Before, they would go out and sit, and they would take the food, and they would go maybe a little bit away to get the food to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2143">00:35:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after that, I was so disturbed by what I heard, I made all the students that I would bring out to the homeless center,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2151">00:35:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "You stick right next to me, where if I have to be able to see you, you're not allowed to go out of that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2156">00:35:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't really explain to them everything that I heard, because I didn't want to disturb them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2161">00:36:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I remember wrestling, going out there thinking, "These guys are not good people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2168">00:36:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">These guys don't deserve to be loved."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2174">00:36:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I share this with you is because I want you to emotionally understand what the Pharisees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2180">00:36:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and why the Jews hated these tax collectors so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2185">00:36:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The tax collectors, these guys were traitors to the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2191">00:36:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">These guys were not theoretically bad people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2194">00:36:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost every Jew has been disturbed in some manner because of these tax collectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2201">00:36:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans, because they conquered so much land, they couldn't keep things in order,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2207">00:36:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so in order to collect taxes, they used what was called the tax farming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2212">00:36:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Tax farming basically was, they would recruit the locals of whatever land that they conquered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2218">00:36:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and they would auction off to the highest bidder, whoever wanted to collect taxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2223">00:37:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because they knew there was instant success, instant money, instant wealth that would come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2230">00:37:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They would come, and you typically would attract shady people to come, and they would bid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2235">00:37:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and whoever is the highest bidder would get the rights to collect the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2241">00:37:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that in and of itself, you can see how that would attract certain types of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2246">00:37:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but the way that they did it was, there are two different categories of taxes in this tax farming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2252">00:37:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">One was the fixed flat tax, and that was based upon a census.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2257">00:37:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember when Jesus was being born, Joseph and Mary had to go back to their hometown to be counted in the census,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2262">00:37:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because based upon these census, they would tax the people, and that's a flat rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2266">00:37:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you exist, you get taxed, and there's no way to fudge that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2270">00:37:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the flat tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2273">00:37:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they had what's called the duties and tolls tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2276">00:37:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Duties and tolls tax basically was just a loose set of things that you can tax, and that was spices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2284">00:38:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be tomatoes that you had. It could be cloth. It could be the horse that you're riding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2289">00:38:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be the road tax. It could be anything that you could imagine that they had the freedom to tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2295">00:38:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way that the Romans did it was they would auction it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2298">00:38:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Whoever bid, they would require of them the fixed tax to be turned in, and then they would have a certain amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2304">00:38:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once they reached that, everything else that collect that's left over is theirs to keep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2310">00:38:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So this whole system itself was a setup for corruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2317">00:38:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It was so rare that a tax collector was not corrupt that they would highlight that this tax collector is trustable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2326">00:38:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, they were known to be corrupt that by their own law, they forbid tax collectors to be witnesses in the court of law in the Jewish community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2335">00:38:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't trusted. It was like getting a drug dealer to come and testify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2339">00:38:59.640</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2343">00:39:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how the tax collectors were seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2347">00:39:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They were able to get anybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2349">00:39:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just a maybe you're pregnant, you're on the way to the hospital, and they say you need to pay a road tax and collect money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2355">00:39:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever farming that you had and you collected and you're going out and give it away or sell it, they can stop that and tax it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2361">00:39:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a frequent act that if you were on your way, they would ask you to open up your bags,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2366">00:39:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">open up whatever you have on your horse, whatever you're carrying, and anything that they saw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2371">00:39:31.640</a></span> | <span

couldn't pay it, what they would do is pay it out of the generosity of my own heart,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2380">00:39:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll pay it to you, and then they would charge them exorbitant amount of taxes or interest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2387">00:39:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which oftentimes they couldn't pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2390">00:39:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So they would come and they would confiscate your property and take away things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2395">00:39:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine just how much disdain that every single Jew would have encountered a tax collector at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2406">00:40:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if they couldn't pay the taxes and pay them back, they would hire thugs to go after

by thugs and gangsters who were going to do their duty of force the taxes upon them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2420">00:40:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine what they were like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4Y8mYU8u0&t=2423">00:40:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the best places to collect taxes is wherever there's a lot of people gathered
