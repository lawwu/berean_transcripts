href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2415s">00:40:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Back then, most people did not have wedding coordinators because I was their wedding

the people and say, "We need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2428s">00:40:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">shift.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2434s">00:40:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after the wedding was over, we would stay longer and clean up and we would say</span></div><div

smaller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2444s">00:40:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every wedding was a huge celebration, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2448s">00:40:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It made all of us feel like grownups, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2451s">00:40:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Stuck around and it's like, "Oh, they're getting

invitations because our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2457s">00:40:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was small.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2460s">00:41:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they would come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2461s">00:41:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a lot of college students who had no idea who they were, they would just show up</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2466s">00:41:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was all calculated into the meals and into the celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2470s">00:41:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're just reminiscing about that and how it used to be and, you know, how every celebration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2474s">00:41:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">when people had hardship, we were all there together, cried together, laughed together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2478s">00:41:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the difficulties now that the church is bigger, it's hard, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2483s">00:41:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You

of the things that happens when the church is big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2491s">00:41:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know there's some of you who were there like 20 years ago thinking, "Oh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/705175135#t=2495s">00:41:35.400</a></span> |
