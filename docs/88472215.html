we talked about justification, justification was the act of God where He pronounced you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He declared you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=261s">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only that, through Christ, you are righteous, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, adoption, some people will say, "No, adoption is not so much like an act of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=270s">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of like when we, in the beginning of this whole series, talked about ransom, talked about atonement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are big, broad strokes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=280s">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are big categories of what God did in their salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=283s">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, someone says, "God adopted you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=285s">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're talking about the totality of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=289s">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In one sense, that's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=291s">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why today we're talking about it in this process is because it definitely seems, okay, it definitely seems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that this has both a chronological and a very specific act of God where He makes you His son, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in theology, adoption will be basically an act of God whereby He makes us members of His family, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=319s">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just think about that for a moment, alright?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To bring you to a point of salvation, not only does He foreordain, call, regenerate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=331s">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then He, or regenerate, calls, okay, justifies, and then He adopts you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason why I'm calling this part of the salvation, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you might be thinking not so much like, "Oh, what is that really saving from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=346s">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that actually saving from sin?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my basic argument is, look at what Jesus just said, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=352s">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the passage that we just read in John chapter 8,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=355s">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our previous circumstance was a circumstance in which we were sons of God's enemy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=364s">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were members of the family, so to speak, okay, of the fallen angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=371s">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's weird to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=373s">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I want to also highlight to you is when we read that passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/88472215#t=377s">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ started speaking about how when Satan
