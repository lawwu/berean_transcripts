Amen. Amen. Amen. Welcome to Brink Community Church. Sorry, it's been a while since I've been up here. What happened? All right, there it is. Okay. First of all, as you can see, we have Communion Sunday today. So I hope you guys came prepared for the sacred time. We mentioned to you how Lachie is going to be open soon.</p><p>And starting today, Lachie is going to be reopened. So that's a lot where our shuttle was going before. But because we had some issues there, we kind of cut it off for a while. But starting from today, Lachie is going to be open. But not only on Sunday, but Lachie will be open on Fridays and Wednesdays as well.</p><p>So going forward, our Bible study time on when we pick up our Bible study, Lachie will be open. The shuttles will be going there. And also on Friday, when we have praise and prayer, Lachie will be reopened. So Lachie will also be open. That's a lot that was open with that big parking lot.</p><p>On Sundays, the shuttles will be going there also, but only on Sundays. Okay. But Lachie on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, there will be parking allowed there. Okay, so just keep that in mind. And then our Bible study, our Foundations of Redemptive History through the Book of Genesis, Chapter 1 through 11, is beginning soon on September 3rd.</p><p>So those of you who are small group leaders and home group leads, the week prior to that, on Wednesday, we have a dinner. So you should have gotten an invitation for that. So if you haven't responded to that, please respond as soon as possible. If you have not signed up yet, today is the last day that you're going to be able to sign up where we're going to be able to place you in certain places.</p><p>Okay. So if you sign up after today, we're going to end up having to place you wherever it's open. So if you sign up after today and say, hey, can I go into this Bible study? We will not be able to do that. Or can I enter into this home group?</p><p>We will not be able to do that. Okay. So if you haven't signed up, please sign up by today. And then the sign up will still be open, but you won't be able to choose where you go. So some of you may end up going to the newcomer's Bible study if we do not have enough space.</p><p>So just keep that in mind. So if you haven't signed up, please do it by today. And then lastly, this coming Saturday, we have a men's ministry gathering at 9 a.m. And the topic is going to be Christians in the workplace. So there's going to be a brief teaching on this subject.</p><p>And then we're going to have some of the older men in our church who's going to be in part of the panel discussion. And so you'll be able to ask some questions. This is one of those topics that are, you know, are asked all the time, right? And whether you are a young Christian or you've been a Christian for a long time, whether you're married or you have many children, one of the questions is how do we incorporate?</p><p>How do we see our workplace and our Christian faith? And so how do we redeem that for God's glory? And so that's the subject of the topic this coming Saturday. So please come by 9 a.m. If you sign up after today, the cost of the lunch is going to go up to 15 because they're already preparing.</p><p>And so if today is the last day where the cost will be 10, and then after today it will be 15 because we would have to move things around and buy more stuff for that. So please do that as soon as possible. Okay. All right. I think that's it for the announcement.</p><p>Why don't we take some time to pray for the offering? And then if you have a physical offering to give, we have an offering box in the back that you can visit on your way out. All right. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this morning. We thank you, Lord God, for the privilege that we have to be able to gather together as a church, to seek you, to express our appreciation and love to you, to worship you, Lord God, to the best of our ability in spirit and in truth.</p><p>I pray, Father, that your word would continue to bear fruit in our hearts. I pray that when we sing, that we would sing honestly, with truth and spirit, expression of our gratitude toward you. I pray that we would hear your word with open and ready hearts, Lord God, not just to hear, but to apply.</p><p>I pray that even in this giving, help us to give as an act of worship. and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100 for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Let us pray. Let us all rise, and I'll spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.</p><p>Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray. Let us pray.
