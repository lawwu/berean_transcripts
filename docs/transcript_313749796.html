I'm not gonna have you guys do this together because we are a smaller group, but let me ask you this, okay? Genesis, what is it about? Just think in your head. Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy. Those first five, you've probably got down, okay? Joshua, you have a picture in your head of a general standing over a city? Judges, right? Rest, relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration, rest. Ruth, you have that in your head? Last week we covered 1 Samuel. What was one sand mule about? You guys remember? Saul, how about two sand mules? What was two sand mules about? David, one king. Solomon, remember there's a king with a half a heart surrounded by ladies with a mic. Two kings, second kings, the divided kingdom, okay? One Chronicles. About David again, we're going backward. Two Chronicles, the line of Judah. So the north is not included now in the Chronicles. Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, what's it about? Rebuilding the temple and basically the holy city again. 'Cause for 70 years it was uninhabited by Jews. Only the peasants were there. And for 70 years it started being inhabited by all the peoples around. So they go back to Jerusalem, they rebuild the temple. Nehemiah, what was that about? Nehemiah, rebuilding the wall. Because every time they tried to build a temple, everybody around them kept attacking them to stop the work. Because look, let's say 70 years ago someone left Mitchell Street, okay? And then all of a sudden someone shows up and says, "Hey, my ancestors lived here 70 years ago, get out." And they actually pitch a tent and build a little, like a shack in our lawn in the front. Obviously we're gonna not be happy about this, okay? So they actually build a wall around the whole city. And that's what Nehemiah is about, okay? And then there's different problems there. What are the three bodies of water that run through the middle of Israel? Gals, who's dead? Jordan's dead. Galilee, Jordan, Dead Sea. And clockwise, what are the enemies? Higher I am, may fail, right? Hittites, Arameans, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines, and later, and then the Hittites, who did they become later? Who are they conquered by? The Phoenicians, that's a minor point. But on the maps later you'll look at that and you go like, the Phoenicians. So just so that you're not confused, I explain that. What are the major landmarks in Israel's history? 2000 to zero, you could describe it now in depth, but we're just gonna go big. Abraham, Moses, David, returns, Jesus, okay? And what was between 1500 to 1000? The only thing you really need to remember is Moses, and then you have the history of tribes, judges, kings. Who's the very first king of the nation of Israel who the people chose? Saul, who was God's choice? David, and that was 1010. And then 40, 40, 40, okay? And so Saul was bad. He was a Benjaminite, 'cause remember, the Benjaminites were a very shame-filled tribe, but he's from there. Benjamin, arrogance, disobedience, is followed by David, who was a Jewish-American. Just kidding, he's a USA, right? United the tribes, established Jerusalem for the center of worship. Before, there was no capital for worship. Everyone just worshiped wherever the priests gathered, right? And then, assembled masses of armies. His son Solomon, because David was so good at warfare, he was chilling, right? Temple, city, proverb, teacher, TCPT. Temple, culture, peace, taxes, and for how many years did he reign? 40, so king, king, then split happens at 931, 930, right? So we're there. What are some distinctions of the Northern Kingdom? How many tribes? 10, how many on the bottom? Two, about four of you asked me, but on the map, it looks like there's four tribes on the bottom. Eventually, it's 10 and two, okay? How they get there, you're gonna have to fill in those pieces for yourself. 10, two, what's the North called? Israel, good or bad? Bad, what's their capital? Samaria, South, good or bad? Good, Benjamin, what's their capital? It stays Judah, okay? Up in the North, they can't worship, so they set up Dan and Bethel, and they set up golden calves, and eventually that ruins them. Who's the first king in the North? Junior, J. Jeroboam, who's in the South? Rehoboam, Jeroboam was Solomon's servant who ended up exalting himself. Well, the Lord helped him, he prophesied, but he exalted himself and became king. His family is kind of funny, and you're gonna read about that today. And then Rehoboam's the South, so he becomes a king. Let's see. Who are kings one, six, 11, and 16? King Rehoboam is what we need to remember. Rehoboam, six, Ahaziah, 11, Jotham, Josiah, okay? So let's fill in two through five. Do you remember last week we learned what was the little thing? Rehoboam's daddy, or Appah's Gigi, okay? Rehoboam, Abijah, Asah, and Asah's good, okay? Jehoshaphat, Jehoram. There's a lot of Jeho something, okay? There's a lot of 'em, so just keep that in mind and don't get confused. So we did one through six, 11 to 16, and today we're gonna do 10 to 15, or 10, is that right? Six through 10, okay? And then can you guys remember the half Bible cheer? We didn't focus on this too much last week. King, king, split, A, B, C, D. Medo, Persians, returning Greeks. And today's focus is gonna be between the split and just up until Babylon, okay? So basically 9.30 to about 7.22 is where we're gonna focus. And then next week we're gonna talk about Babylon, captivity, destruction. The fifth week, is next week the fifth week? Oh, next week's the fourth week. The fifth week we're gonna look at all the returns, and then the sixth week we're gonna do a big review, and then we're gonna do what happens in the intertestamental period, okay? So we're taking it little clumps, and my goal is not to give you information, my goal is to what? Make you wanna learn, and you can do the same to other people. And I'm giving you the skeleton, what's your job? To put in the everything else, okay? To flesh it out. So you guys remember this one, okay? You guys know what everything stands for here? No problem, right? Abraham, Moses, David, returns, Jesus, tribes, judges, kings, and then we have the five R's, which were rest, relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration, and again and again. That is easy. So we looked at this last week, basically Mount JK, Moses, tribes, judges, kings, the only things we need to remember, to have 12 tribal territories, 10 sons of Jacob, one tribe of Joseph mixed, okay? 12th tribe, what's their name? Levi, they didn't have land, okay? But they had 48 cities, six cities of refuge, three were on the east of the Jordan, three on the west of the Jordan, and technically, financially, they were supposed to be the richest tribe. Because let's say everyone has 100 bucks, and they have to give $10 to the Levites. Everyone has 90 bucks. How much do the Levites have? $110. So you guys follow me? So they're actually supposed to be the richest, okay? They just don't have a land. But that corrupted them, as you will later come to see. We looked at the bodies of water, Galilee, Jordan, Dead Sea. Are these bodies of water important in the New Testament? Yeah, because they don't move, okay? Jesus goes from Galilee, Jesus goes to, he's like baptizing, John's baptizing in the Jordan River. So you're seeing all of this, okay? So he's just going back and forth. And they're fishing on the Mediterranean, okay? 'Cause they can't fish on the Dead Sea, why? There's nothing there, it's dead, okay? So you're gonna slowly, if you remember Gales, Jordan's dead, you just, even in Jesus's time, you can kind of piece together what goes where, okay? And here I am, may fail, right? Hittites, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, and the Philistines. Philistine capitals are very, they're worth memorizing, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, like because in the Book of Amos, they get mentioned a lot. And later you'll see a bunch of people called the Ashdodites, they're Philistines. So just kind of keep that in mind. I'm giving you little bite-sized pieces so you don't get overwhelmed. But the Philistine cities are worth taking note of, okay? And then later the Phoenicians, take over there. We looked at the tribes, Israel, 10 tribes, capital is eventually Samaria, we're gonna look at that today. Worship was done at Bethel and Dan. Why was worship done at Bethel and Dan? Practically speaking, they can't go to Jerusalem because if they go to Jerusalem, what happens? They get punched in the face, okay? I don't know what happened, but like it's enemy territory now. First King is Jeroboam I. If there's a one there, do you think there's gonna be a two? Yeah, he's important too, okay? He's actually probably the most, one of the most heralded kings of the Old Testament in the Northern Kingdom. But just so you don't get confused, you have to remember there are two Jeroboams. The historical reference goes from First Kings 12 to Second Kings 17. And then how many kings that were good? Zero, okay? We're gonna look at the Israel kings briefly today. South is a good place. What's it called? Judah. Two tribes, Benjamin and Judah. Capital is Jerusalem. Worship is done in Jerusalem. Rehoboam, son of Solomon, is the first king. And who's his mom? That's not important, okay? Solomon's mom was Bathsheba, interestingly enough. What happened to Solomon's older sibling? Died, okay? So just keep those things in mind. Historical reference is a lot longer. And what's the difference between the references for the North and the South? There is zero chronicles in reference to the North. Chronicles are basically all about Judah, okay? So far you guys have followed thus far, so you probably are now a little bit more, less intimidated by the Old Testament. Today we're gonna cover some more stuff that hopefully is a little bit fun. King-King split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks. Now, here's the Old Testament key number 12. Here we go, repeat after me. Are you guys ready? Split, two, seven, two, two. Split, two, seven, two, two. Can you do that? Split, two, seven, two, two. Split, two, seven, two, two. Proclaim it. Split, two, seven, two, two. Split, two, seven, two, two. Sing it. ♪ Split, two, seven, two, two ♪ Or something, okay? Split, two, seven, two, two. How do you remember that? But you remember the cheer, right? Split, two, seven, two, two. 722 is very important historically, okay? So this is what it is. Split is? The civil war. The two is Oak Testament key number 13. Okay? And Samaria falling in northern kingdom, that's 722. Split, two, 722, split, two, 722. So you guys memorize the key number 12, right? No problem? Okay? Now, how do you remember all the stuff that happens between the civil war, okay? How do you remember all the stuff that happens between the civil war and the northern kingdom falling? There's an easy way, okay, to remember this. And I'm gonna sing a little song for you. ♪ We jammin' ♪ ♪ I wanna jam it with you ♪ ♪ We jammin', right? ♪ And what's the next line? ♪ Hope you like a jammin' too ♪ Right, who's that from? Bob Marley. So, split, two, 722, and in the middle, who do you think of? Bob Marley. ♪ We jammin' ♪ ♪ Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh ♪ ♪ I wanna jam it with you ♪ ♪ Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh ♪ ♪ We jammin' ♪ And what's the next line? ♪ Hope you like a jammin' too ♪ Right, so that's what you need to remember, but we're gonna look at it like this. The landmarks of the middle, split, two, 722, the landmarks of that two is we, okay? And the Old Testament books that you need to know are jammin'. All right? So, repeat after me, we. Say we. Jammin'. Okay? ♪ We jammin', we are jammin' ♪ Okay? That's how you remember. So, what goes on with the we? War. Elijah, Elisha, that's huge. Elijah and Elisha's ministry are both very huge, but they're in the north. They're not mentioned in the Chronicles, because Chronicles is about who? The south. So, Elijah, Elisha, mostly all in the north, and then the Assyria happens in 722. Got it? We are, and then what are the OT books? Jammin'. Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum are the books that correlate to this period. But Jonah and Nahum are in green, okay? And Jonah and Nahum are all basically about Assyria. Jonah is an invitation to Assyria to repent. Nahum, cover to cover, the three chapters are all about Nineveh or Assyria's utter and complete destruction. Okay? Oh, there's a part that's cut off on the bottom. It actually says, "The fall of Samaria." Actually, no, no, nevermind. So, you guys got that? Split, two. Thank you, Gen I. Split, two, 722, split, two, 722, split, two, 722, and what's the two? We are jammin', okay? War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and what are the books? Jammin', right? Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum. And what two books are the bookends of the invitation and destruction of Assyria? Jonah and Nahum. Is that easy enough to remember? Okay, don't be intimidated by, to read God's holy word. Here we go. This is the Bible, what do you call it? The references. War, you're looking at 1 Kings 14 to 16. Elijah is 1 Kings 16 to 22, and remember, this is all going on in the north. Elisha is 2 Kings 1 through 8. So, 1 and 2 Kings, also there's a easy division between Elijah and Elisha. Elijah doesn't come up in 2 Kings. Elisha starts his ministry in 2 Kings. Got it? Assyria happens in 722. Now, Assyria's been around longer than 722, but what happens in 722? They take over Samaria. Okay, that's why it's an important time. And this section's a lot of fun to read because you actually read that Elisha ran faster than a chariot. It's so interesting because the most famous king in the northern kingdom was Ahab, and Elisha just challenges Ahab, basically makes Ahab look bad, and then tells Ahab to go, and then he actually outruns him. Ahab's on a chariot of horses, but Elisha girds up his loins, and he just runs. And then one chapter later, he's scared of Ahab's wife, and he's hiding in a cave, scared of his life. So, you got all kinds of funny things that are going on in here. And then Elisha, the prophet, what does he do when someone calls him bald? He sends bears to kill the kids. So, you just have all kinds of stuff. So, the Old Testament, if you know what you're looking at, it gets very interesting. You can make some funny cartoons and some movies out of it. Okay, old bald head, you bald head, send two bears, and just kill the whole village of kids. But this is all happening, was it southern? Is it Judah's kids that were killed by bears, or northern kingdom kids? Northern kingdom kids, okay? And then the fall of Samaria is described in seven chapters, constant attack, and an eventual fall. Okay, and then second Kings 14 to 16, you have a correlation with the books of the prophets. And the same thing is kind of repeated in second Chronicles 10 to 28. These are not things that you need to necessarily remember offhand. It's just kind of in reference, just kind of be mindful. We are Jaman, right? War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria. And what year was Assyria now conquering Samaria? What year? 722, split, two, 722. We are Jaman. And what are the books of the Old Testament that correlate to the fall of Samaria and then the time between the split and the fall? Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and then Nahum. And what two books of the Old Testament are all about the invitation to Nineveh and the destruction of Nineveh? Jonah and Nahum, okay? So we have this again. We're gonna throw that in there. And you guys know what all of this is, right? So that's split, two, 722 is right there. Okay, 930 to 722. That little section is the split, two, 722, war, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Jaman, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, okay? So just remember, who's that? We Jaman, okay, Bob Marley. War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria. Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum. So I said it, now I'm showing it to you. Hopefully this is etched into your brain. Easy enough? Okay, we're gonna move on. The very first king of the Northern Kingdom. We're gonna memorize all 20 kings of Judah, but we're only gonna memorize just a few kings of Israel, okay, because they are worth remembering to some degree. Now, you guys see Old Testament key number 14. Just remember, Jeroboam, okay, B-O-A-M, Jeroboam. But if you look on the screen up there, that is actually not an M. What does it look like? That is not an M. Some of you guys who are a little bit more like, like badly eyed, you're trying to squint, but that's a J and an H, okay? So just squint and turn a J and an H into an M, or break up the H of the M into a J and an H, okay? That's how you remember noteworthy kings of the Kingdom of Israel, okay? So we're gonna call it Jeroboam with a distorted M. And what two letters make up that M? J and an H. Now, if you look at your chart, I made a little chart with all the kings for you of the north, okay? Just take a look, okay? Like king number eight, Ahaziah, does that name sound familiar? Yeah, because that's king number six of Judah. Different dude. So if you're reading the first kings, you're like, and you're trying to do like cross-referencing other kings, you're gonna get confused. These are two completely different Ahaziahs, okay? The other Ahaziah actually starts his reign in 841, and he's the son-in-law of King Ahab, but the guy right before him is another Ahaziah. So it's just, if you're not familiar with what you need to look at, it gets confusing. Jehoram, number nine, is actually, he's a southern king that we looked at last week, right? Okay, but he actually married into Ahab's family and partially was king for a little bit of the northern kingdom as well. Jehoahaz, that's king number, that's king number 17 in Judah, but this guy has the same name. King number 17, Jehoahaz, reigned from 609 to 609. He comes and disappears really fast, but this Jehoahaz was a couple hundred years before. Don't get confused. Jehoash, there's two of them too, and one of them is a king of the south, okay? Zachariah, why do you know the name Zachariah? It's a prophet, but no evil, wicked king of the north would ever serve as God's prophet, so this is a different dude. Did you know there's like 14 Obadiahs in the Bible? So it's confusing if you don't know what to look for. So just remember that some of these guys have the same name as important guys in the southern kingdom, but they're not the same guys, okay? But Jehoram is also a southern king, okay, so that's all you need to remember, but we're gonna do Jeroboam, this Old Testament king number 14. The first guy you should remember is Jeroboam I, and what do you know about him? He's the servant of Solomon. He was the son of a Nabat, okay? But he was the first king who sinned against God by making anyone a Levite, by setting up Dan and Bethel for worship, so you need to know him because he's the first king. Second king you need to know is Baasha, okay? Baasha, so you need to know the Jerob and you need to know the Ba, okay? Baasha kills Jeroboam's son, Nadab, and Nadab is also familiar because what happened, who's the Nadab you guys are familiar with? Leviticus, right, one of the sons of Aaron. This Nadab is not that guy, okay? This Nadab was a son of Jeroboam. He reigned two years and then he was assassinated by Baasha. And then he wipes out all of Jeroboam's family. So every single person that is alive in Jeroboam's family, Baasha wipes them out, okay? And then his family takes over as king. So Baasha is important to remember, okay? The next guy, what's his name start with? Oh, his name is Omri, okay? That's king number six. Omri is important because he kills all of Baasha's family, wipes them all out. And then a guy named Zimri becomes king for seven days and the Baasha kills him, or no, Baasha attacks him and then when Zimri sees that all of the stuff around him is colliding, like it's falling apart, he sets the king's house on fire and he kills himself. So one of the five suicides mentioned in the scriptures. Okay, so Baasha and then Omri takes over. Omri purchases a hill from a guy named Shomer in 1 Kings 16 for two talents of silver and he names that hill Samaria and he sets that up as a capital of the north. So who sets up Samaria as a capital of the north? Omri. Ahab introduces Baal worship and it destroys this nation. And that's why Elijah and Elisha are always at his, just fighting with him, okay? Ahab was a wicked, wicked king. What's his wife's name? She's one of the few women that everybody knows in the Bible. What's her name? Jezebel, okay? So Ahab, you should just kind of remember that he introduced Baal worship and he's bad, okay? So Jeroboam, the next one is that distorted M. That first half of the distorted M is the J, right? But this J is easy to remember because it's another Jeroboam. Jeroboam II basically made Israel the richest it had ever been. And because Jeroboam made this country so rich and he said it's because God is blessing us. So he actually sets up like revival dates, he sets worship times and he does all of this stuff with a pretense of worship because look, God is favoring us. We have now a great nation that's wealthy. In the book of Amos, God shows up and says, shut up, away with the noise of your songs. I am tired of your symbols, but let justice and mercy flow on like a river. So Amos is written to the north at their richest time and they're very religious. So that would probably speak volumes into our society, right? Oh, God is blessing us or even Korean society. God is blessing us, but is God happy with you? Is money a sign of blessing? Not always. It's a sign that God has given you over. But what king was responsible for financial reform? Number two, okay? Not related to Jeroboam I, okay? So different guy. And the last one you need to know, his name is Hosea. And I just call him Hosea, okay? Because the northern kingdom got hushed after him. All right, and there goes the northern kingdom, it's done. So you have 18 kings of the northern kingdom. Who do you need to remember? I'm gonna give you a little bit to write down and then I'll turn this off, okay? Five seconds. All right. Split, two, what year? Oh, you guys are genius. So in the two, between 930 and 722, what are the major landmarks that you need to remember? War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria. What books of the Old Testament fall into that period? Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum. What two books of the Old Testament focus mostly on the repentance and destruction of Assyria? Jonah and Nahum. So there are 18 kings of the northern kingdom. How many of them are good? Zero, okay? What kings should you remember? Jeroboam I, Boa, okay, Boaam. Bahasha, Omri, who did what? He established Samaria, okay? First Kings 16, 24. And then Ahab, who's Omri's son. See, these great powerful kings who established stuff, their sons basically get hooked up and then they sin more, okay? So Ahab is the wickedest king, but he, actually Manasseh and Ammon after him, they call him even more wicked than Ahab. But Ahab is a wicked king. His dad is who? Omri, what did Omri do? Just think Shamamria, okay? Or just Omri, okay? And the Samaria is named after a guy named Shamar, right? He bought two talents of silver, he bought it. And so we don't know why he named it after the owner of that hill, but Omri did, okay? Boaam, Bahasha, Omri, Ahab, and then the last one, Jeroboam, oh, and then the last one, Hosea. He was the one who basically got destroyed by Assyria. All right? Now, we're gonna look at the book of Esther, okay? (chuckles) What is she stirring with? An S. So it's an Esther. All right? There's a Persian cat there, Persian curtains, and a Persian rug. What do you think Esther's about? Life in Persia. And just as a quick factoid, this book actually should be called Hadassah, the book of Hadassah. But why is it called Esther? What culture do you think the name Esther is derived from? It's a Persian name, meaning star. It's all of that, like Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, those are all Jewish names. But you get Esther in here as a Persian name because she was that famous, okay? So just think Esther and everything Persian. And this book is interesting because there is no mention of God at all in the whole book. How many mentions of God? Zero. The only book of the entire Bible where God is ignored or not mentioned at all. Okay? There's no mention of God. This was the book that was of great comfort to the Jews during the time of the Holocaust. So they read and quoted from this book. And what's also interesting is, remember, King-King split, A, B, C, D, Medo, Persians returns, three raves, right? And Greeks. This is about the people who didn't go back to build Jerusalem. These are the less godly people who decided, nah, eh, no thank you very much. It's kind of like saying this. Some of you guys are from Korean descent, some of you guys are of Chinese descent. It's kind of like saying your great-grandma says, we need to go back to our hometown to rebuild our family's legacy. Would you guys wanna go back or no? Heck no, I'm not going back. You know, like why? Right? That was the mentality of the people. Because for 70 years, Persia was all they knew. So I don't even speak Hebrew. Why do I need to go back? I like it here. I have a nice skewer business going on here. Okay, I don't need to go back. Only 50,000 people went back, 49,687 of them. Okay, 49,687 of them went back. Everybody else stayed back in Persia. Among whom was Mordecai, Esther's uncle, or Hadassah's uncle. Okay, so Esther's about what? Esther's stirring, it's all about life in Persia, and Esther is famous because a lot of Bible stories, children's Bible stories have that in there. Okay, and I'm gonna pause here a little bit. You guys know this, 5-12, 5-5-12, 5-12, 5-5-12. What is this? Moses. History. Esther's the last history book, got it? So we've gone over what every book of the first two categories is about. We went over all of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and we just covered last week and this week, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther. Okay? So Pentateuch, History, Poetry, Major Prophets, and Minor Prophets. So we have Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, we covered those things. And you guys remember, nod your heads if you remember what they are about. If I give you a test right now, and if you pass this test with flying colors, you get a boba, if you don't, you get punched in the face. Would you guys be able to pass this test? Yeah, okay? Next 12, Joshua, what's that about? Conquest, Judges, Cycles, Ruth, love story in the Book of Judges, or time of Judges, 1 Samuel, David, Saul, right? 2 Samuel, David, 1 Kings, Solomon, 2 Kings, divided kingdom, it starts with Elisha, right? The story just starts with Elisha. 1 Chronicles, he's holding one newspaper with the star, David, and then the second Chronicles, about the Jews, Judah. Ezra is about, and how much time do you think has elapsed between 2 Chronicles, chapter 36, and Ezra, chapter one? 70 years, 'cause they're all in captivity, okay? Nehemiah is about the wall around the city because they're trying to build but everyone keeps messing up the projects, right? Ah, I just built the pillar, whoosh, oh, they gotta start all over. So obviously they're discouraged. So because they're discouraged, they stop building and they just kinda carry on with their lives and Haggai comes out all strong, dude, and Zechariah comes all strong, right? Is it a time for you to live in these paddled houses while the house of God remains a ruin? They're like, geez, then at least protect us from the peoples or something. So the people have a legitimate gripe because they don't realize yet that the righteous will live by faith, but they're just, ah, right? So Ezra and Nehemiah are almost together and those are the returns, and Esther is, something that happens during the time of the returns but up north still 'cause they didn't come back. You guys following me? Okay, so, and Esther is much later. It's chronologically one of the last books of the Old Testament, chronologically, but it's right smack in the middle. That's why I'll get confused, and Job is the first one. So it'll mess you up. And today we're gonna cover Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon. These should be easier because you're probably already familiar with them. So I'm gonna go through them pretty quickly. This guy's name is Job, okay? I was like, this is a disappointing picture 'cause it doesn't really tell you how his name comes to be, but just remember this guy's suffering. Okay, poor dude. The thing is about the sovereign hands of God. Although there's only one hand in the picture, just, you guys get my point, all right? God's sovereignty in the midst of suffering. God's sovereignty in the midst of suffering. And this is a book of Psalms, okay? What's one palm doing? Singing, and the other one is doing what? His hands are like this. That's hard to see. He's praying, okay? Or you could look down at your picture. There's one who's singing praises. The other one who's praying prayers. So the Psalm, palms, Psalms, they're about praises and prayers. What's Esther about? Persia, Job, sovereign hands. It's not about suffering. It's about what? God's sovereignty. Satan has to ask God's permission, right? And it's all about God allowing it. So it has nothing to do with like merited suffering. It's about the sovereignty of God. Psalms was about two things, praise and prayer. Coincidentally, what do we have this Friday? Praise and prayer. So try to read Psalms 1 through 150 by the end of this week in preparation, and you'll be adequately prepared. Next one. Proverbs is an English word, so you don't need to think too hard on it. A fool and his money. But this is about Proverbs. It's God honoring life skills and wisdom. One thing you'll know about the Proverbs is not about how people come to earn the righteousness of God. The Proverbs is not about how to be saved. And it's not about morality. The Proverbs are about how God's people should live. Proverbs basically means life skills. That's why when I talk to parents, I tell them be very careful when you teach Proverbs to your children. Be very careful when you tell them to memorize the Proverbs. It's not that it's not applicable to children because Solomon wrote it to his children. Okay, I mean grown children probably. But you teach your kids wrong, and they can do the Proverbs right, they might trick themselves into thinking that they're religious and they're upright. So Proverbs is actually a dangerous book to teach because it emphasizes morality. And you shouldn't try to come up with life applications of what Christians must do from the Proverbs. Proverbs is all about what a Christian, what a God honoring man ought to look like. You guys see the slight difference? It's easy, if you're not careful, it's easy to swing this way and be like, hey, beloved daughter or beloved son, okay? I've memorized a bunch of Proverbs, but none of them is sticking in my head right now. Okay, you guys know what I'm saying, right? Okay. (audience laughing) So a Proverbs is life skills. And it's not about how to please God. Okay, it's about how wisdom makes your life reflect God's goodness. Not do this and please God. So be careful when you quote the Proverbs as prescriptives. The next one is Ecclesiastes, and what do you see in this picture? Compared to all the other pictures, this is just nothing. Okay, Ecclesiastes is all about emptiness and vanity. Emptiness and vanity. Okay, Ecclesiastes, emptiness and vanity, moving forward. Who's this? Remember the king who's half-hearted, singing, or actually, he has, but this one, there's one wife. Okay, so it's a Song of Solomon. It's all about the beauty of love in a marriage covenant. It's a beauty of love in a marriage covenant. Is it? Oh, okay. Page 15 is missing. Is it page 15 is missing? Okay, well, I'll email this to you. Oh, this page is missing? Okay, that's a complete, that's a Xerox machine error. Who has it? Oh, okay. 'Cause I even had the machine staple it, so I guess it just skipped it, okay? But I'll email it to you. Email me, or like, actually, don't email me. I'll just put it up, okay, somewhere, on the Berean Facebook page or something. Song of Solomon, beauty of love in a marriage covenant. Now, what I wanna do before you guys break up into part two is to find a partner and go over these now, that you guys are a little bit more familiar with what goes up until 7/22, all right? So find a partner. This helps to reinforce. Like, some of you guys are like, I am so antisocial. Why do you make me do this every week? Be social, okay? Consider how to stimulate one another toward love and good deeds, or to growing in the Old Testament. So whoever you're partnered with, just give 'em a big smile, give 'em a fist bump or a hug, and be like, let's do this, okay? And so, and go over these, and then we'll take a little bit of a break until 11.30. (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience laughing) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience laughing) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience laughing) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience laughing) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) (audience chattering) - Okay, one more minute. (audience chattering) (singing in foreign language) 45 more seconds, 45 more seconds, 40 more seconds. (audience chattering) All right, 15 more seconds. (audience chattering) So raise your hand if you feel like the person you tested just a couple minutes back would be a very good candidate to be a special TA if we do the Old Testament survey again, raise your hand. You guys, they got it down? Okay, we're gonna continue with the next two books, and after today, you'll have 24 of the Old Testament books thematically kind of in your head. This "I" is saying "uh," okay? So this picture is an "I say uh," "I say uh." But the dude in the middle, what's he doing? He's weeping. But the dude on the end is doing a exaltation. He's like, "Ah," okay? So the guy is both weeping, and then another guy is rejoicing. Do you guys remember how you remember the Old and New Testament books? Three times nine equals 27. 39 old, 27 new, total 66. Isaiah has 66 chapters. And wouldn't you know it, it breaks down into 39 chapters and then the latter 27. If you actually look at your Bible, you see that division. Okay, God divinely orchestrated the book of Isaiah to be divided this way so that in January 2019, our Old Testament survey class could have easy remembering or memorizing access to this book. His word is perfect, okay? 39 chapters is all about the sorrow that has befallen God's people because of sin. Mostly about just sorrow, 39, about the ruined people of God. But 40 to 66, the last 27 chapters is really about future rejoicing that comes when a Messiah appears. Yes. Ah, thank you. Who needs page 15? Okay, so Isaiah weeping for 39 chapters, rejoicing the latter 27. Breaks down nicely, right? Because the suffering servant is gonna come, right? By his chase, or who, the chastening of our sin our reconciliation fell upon him and by his scourging we are healed in Isaiah 53, five. Okay, so Isaiah is all about weeping, followed up with rejoicing through the Messiah that is to come. Isaiah also writes about the Medo-Persians who are gonna come and he actually names Cyrus by name in chapter 45. But Isaiah's written 200 years before the Medo-Persians came up. So Cyrus wasn't even cellular at this point, okay? So Isaiah prophecies that Cyrus, the one who is serving at the right hand of God will come and deliver his people. So if you actually date the book of Isaiah and you see historically what happens with the Medo-Persians, it's amazing how many prophecies come to pass, okay? Next we have a jury, Maya, jury Maya, okay? And Jeremiah is holding something. What is this? The NASB calls it a waistband. KJV calls it a girdle. The ESV calls it a loincloth. The NIV calls it a belt. I call it a sash, okay? It doesn't matter. It's a piece of clothing that basically held stuff together in the Old Testament. God says in Jeremiah, I think it's chapter 13. He tells Jeremiah in chapter, I think chapter 13. Jeremiah 13, God tells Jeremiah to go to the Euphrates River and take this waistband, loincloth, girdle, sash, belt and hide it in a cleft of a rock. And then, oh it is Jeremiah 13. Verse five, he goes and he does that. And verse six, it says, after many days, God says, arise, go to the Euphrates and take the waistband which I told you to hide there. And it is like stinky and messed up and disgusting. Okay, and that he says is the picture of the rottenness of Judah. Not Israel, of who? Judah, Israel's gone, okay? My people of Judah are rotten to the core like this beautiful, once beautiful belt, sash, waistband, girdle, loincloth, okay? So Isaiah is about 3927, weeping and rejoicing. Jeremiah is about Judah being like a rotten sash. That's why Jeremiah weeps. And he gets thrown into prison. And you actually see the latter historical Judean kings come up and mistreat him a lot. Okay, so once we memorize Kings 16 to 20, you're gonna actually see them come up in the book of Jeremiah, okay? Darius is mentioned in Jeremiah, Cyrus is mentioned in Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar is mentioned in Jeremiah. So all these names are gonna start being familiar to you. Now, who is his king? King Rehoboam, number six, Ahaziah. There's another Ahaziah in the north, but different guy, right? The first guy, King 11 is Jotham. King 16 is Josiah, okay? King Rehoboam. Now, remember Kings one through five, dirty Solomon, Rehoboam's, Abba's, Gigi, okay? We saw that Rehoboam was number one, Abijah two, Asa three, Jehoshaphat four, Jehoram five. And if you have a little bit of time and you wanna become a legit gourmet Bible nerd, memorize the dates, 'cause they will help you, okay? Now, this six through 10 took me an hour and a half, 'cause I was trying so hard to find a way that would make any kind of sense, but I couldn't, okay? So you just have to bear with me on this one, all right? So, this lady has crazy eyelashes, okay? And I put this on there for you, right? Aha, the queen's lashes are amazing, like Uzi's or something, I don't know, okay? So, to give you a visual, I put Uzi's eyelashes, okay? Stare at it, just stare at it, just stare at it. So hopefully, it's like, aha, the queen's lashes are amazing, like Uzi's or something, all right? Just give me a break on this one, I really could not, 'cause there's another Jeho guy, and then there's like, so this one was hard, okay? So I was thinking like, Athalia, thy lashes. Forget it, I just do it this way, okay? This one's easy enough to remember if you guys try hard enough, right? Aha, the queen's lashes equals amazing Uzi's. You guys ever learn my very educated mother just sent us nine pizzas, anybody know what that was? Or kings play chess on funny green squares? Do you guys remember those things? Kingdom, phylum, genus, you know, all that stuff, and then the Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter. So just think of this as one of those, that makes no sense, but aha, the queen's lashes are like amazing Uzi's, I'm so sorry. (laughing) I don't know how else I do it. So, first one, aha, Athalia, okay? Ahaziah, second one is a queen. That's Ahaziah's mom, okay? Ahaziah's mom, Ahaziah was king from 841 to 841, he died. So his mama was not happy. So she tried to kill everybody in the royal line, okay? And have her side of the family take over, 'cause she's not, her son was part of the royal line, but she's from the outside. So she was trying to kill everybody. So she actually was queen over Judah for six years. But she couldn't hunt down one last guy, who was a baby. Because the high priest at the time, knowing the commandment of God, snatched the baby, ran into the temple, and hid him there for six years. The last place the queen would look would be that temple. But the priest hid him in the temple until he was seven. And he was the very first child king. Josiah is a more famous one, but he was the very first child king. So that's Jehoash for lash, okay? 'Cause if I give you another Jeho, you guys probably be like, oh man, there's so many. Okay, so this one is Jehoash, okay? There's no guarantee that next week's is gonna be any more memorable. But just this one is the Uzis, okay? Aha, the queen's lashes are amazing. Uzis, I'm so sorry, okay? Amaziah and Uziah. Little bit of information about him. Ahaziah, he reigned just in 841, he died. He's a bad king, and he was assassinated by a guy named Jehu. Jehu is like a warrior, he kills all kinds of people in the north and the south. But he's assassinated by Jehu. Queen Athaliah, she's bad. And she's executed by Jehoiada, the priest. There's another Jehoiada later that is to come, and he's also a high priest. But that dude is not a good guy. This Jehoiada is good. He's the one who taught Jehoash the word of the Lord, okay? And Jehoiada was like, the king has returned. And this little kid is in like this giant crown, is like, he shows up and then he goes, she needs to be put to death, Athaliah, okay? Number eight is Jehoash. Proverbs 22, six says, train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not turn from it. Where did this boy spend the first six, seven years of his life? At the feet of the high priest who was teaching him the word of God, okay? So he actually grows up to reign as a pretty good king. And around this time, we're thinking maybe the book of Joel is written, but this child king later is assassinated by his officials. So there's all kinds of assassinations going on in the Bible, okay? So if you want like a good mystery novel, not a mystery novel, action-packed stuff, just read the Bible, okay? Amaziah is the next guy. He reigned from 796 to 767. He too was a good king. So now you have almost all of the good kings, minus two or three, that you guys now remember, right? And this was in the time of a major war with Israel, and he too gets assassinated. And his son, at a young age, Uzziah, becomes king. Uzziah, people recognize his name because in the book of Isaiah, it says in chapter six, where Isaiah sees the vision of God and the, what do you call it? In the train of Israel, oh, temple, temple, that's the word. He sees God in his temple, and he goes, "In the year King Uzziah died." King Uzziah had major reforms to the country. So he was like Jeroboam, and Uzziah was almost at the same time. Jeroboam number two brought all kinds of revival and like financially up to the north, Uzziah did that for the south, okay? And this was during the golden age of Judah. So that's why when he dies, Isaiah is really disrupt. (chuckles) Okay. If you need these emailed, just shoot me an email and I'll send it to you. Now, I'm gonna move on. (pages rustling) Ah, that square's not supposed to be there, but. Now, this, what you learn today, it takes up 75% of the Old Testament and half the Bible, what we learned so far. So now you can read half the Bible and not be terrified of it. 75% of the Old Testament, you kind of have a framework in your head. Okay, so that was my hope, okay? And we still have three more classes. So do you guys remember this timeline? Okay. Do you know what all these stand for? If I did this the first class, you'd be like, "What the, it's all these letters." Okay, what are the A, M, D, and R, and J? What are those red ones? The landmarks, right? How about the T and J in the middle, the green ones? That's Mount JK. The blue, K, S, and A, the D and the K are the same, right? Okay, what are the K, S, and A? King, split, Assyria, and then the BCD, it's not the Sundubu place, what is it? Babylon, captivity, destruction, Medo-Persians, the returns, R, R, R, and Greeks is in green. Now I'm gonna make a big timeline, and I'm gonna show you today where all the books of the Old Testament fall in, and then we'll review it again, and I'll add more details later, okay? So I'm gonna, okay, stare at this picture, stare at this timeline a little bit. You guys know what all this is about, okay? I'm gonna add one more, what do you see there? We're jamming, right? We are jamming, what's a W? War, split and war are the same thing, okay? Elijah, Elisha, Assyria. So Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, Deuteronomy are all going there. I would just maybe like, don't write out the whole thing, just kinda go like G-E-E-X, okay? And then you see, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, right there. Got that? Joshua, Judges, Ruth, first and second, Samuel, first Kings. First Kings. Second Kings. Okay, why did I emphasize that? 'Cause that's a long old timeline, okay? First and second Chronicles, first Chronicles. And if you look at first Chronicles, I put a little dash there. Why did I put a little dash there? 'Cause it traces it from the time before David. 'Cause it's talking about David's ancestry as well, right? First and second Chronicles, okay? And what's next? Ezra, Nehemiah, and between second Chronicles and Ezra, is there a small period of time or a big gap? Big gap, because what happened, for how many years were the people of Judah in captivity? 70. Goes over there. Ezra, Nehemiah, and then Esther is later. And all of the stuff that happens is all squished at the end, okay? So this is not to scale. I'm just giving you a biblical eye view, okay? But this is not to scale, 'cause I couldn't fit that all in one slide without you guys having to strain your eyes, okay? Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs. Job is there. Where did we go? Where did Job go? So, if you introduce a new believer to Jesus Christ, a new person to Jesus Christ, so he becomes a believer, and you say, "Read the Bible," and they say, "Okay, I'll start in Genesis." And then they get old. They somehow manage to get through Esther, and then Job is back where, oh my goodness, what is going on here? This is why it's hard, 'cause remember, the Bible is not, Old Testament is not chronologically written, it's what? Genre, okay? Job, Psalms. 'Cause Moses has something there, okay? And what was Psalms about? Prayers and praises, and what's Proverbs about? Life skills, wisdom, Ecclesiastes, vanity, Song of Solomon, about the beauty of love in a covenant marriage. Song of Solomon, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, okay, that's all five of the poetry, okay? Here you go. (clears throat) Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon goes there. Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and then we get the prophets. Isaiah. Jeremiah. Lamentations. Ezekiel. Daniel. Do you know Daniel was born in the year of the lamb? He was born when Assyria was in power, he's a youth when Babylon takes over, and then when the Medo-Persian kings come, they're the ones who throw him into the lion's den. 70 years later, 60 years later. So if you look at Daniel, in just a couple chapters, he goes from a little teenage kid to an old man. Daniel sees all of it, and he also actually sees a vision of the Roman Empire, he sees the vision of the Greeks, he sees a vision of Jesus who's gonna come as a little rock, boom, knock this whole thing down. Okay, so Daniel is a very interesting book, and in seminaries, Daniel and Revelation are usually studied together. Okay, Daniel. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, (speaking in foreign language) Okay, so now all the minor prophets are, Daniel, Hosea, okay, all the minor prophets are coming, boom, you're going backward. Hosea, Amos, Micah, Nahum, remember, (speaking in foreign language) Right? Now, Obadiah and Joel are in italics, and they have a question mark there. Do you know why that is? There is debate as to when they were written. For example, Jeremiah 49 and Obadiah have a lot of similarity, but Jeremiah is much later. And remember, there are like 14 Obadiahs, so we don't know which of them wrote this one. Okay, and Joel, there's nothing inside of it that'll tell us where to date it. So Obadiah and Joel, you don't really know what time to put them in, so we're just putting them in there, okay, with question marks. We jammin', what was the jammin'? Jonah, Amos, Hezekiah, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, Jonah and Nahum are about A, okay? And then Habakkuk, Zephaniah, they're a transitionary, okay? Remember, Habakkuk is watching God show him what's gonna happen, he doesn't like it. And then, woo, fast forward a lot. Haggai, Zechariah are over there. And the last book, Malachi. So, when you introduce someone to faith and you're having them read through the Old Testament, walk them through it, but maybe you couldn't walk them through the Old Testament, walk them through it, but maybe you couldn't walk them through it because you couldn't walk through it without tripping all over yourselves, right? Now you can, and we still have two more sessions to go over all this stuff, okay? We're running out of time, so I'm gonna fast forward a little bit. Oopsie, did I do everything? What happened? Ah, ah. Oh, we did go over everything, right? Okay, so for three minutes, I want you guys to review what we looked at today. There's a lot that we covered. (audience laughing) Go over this with your partner, and then we're gonna do our traditional Bible song, and then we'll end, okay? So two, three minutes, find a partner, or go over this with your partner. If you wanna find somebody new, you could do that. And then go over the, especially the red part, and I'll give you three minutes.

Okay? Let's pray. Father, thank you for helping us walk through your scriptures. I pray that you would give us a deeper hunger to know you, to know your word, to know your heart, and to live according to all the precepts and the statutes and the ordinances that you've set out for us, as you've done so with a heart of great love for us. I pray that you would help us to be effective when we defend our faith and when we defend your scriptures. More and more, we are living in a biblically illiterate time in the church, and Lord, we need your help to be salt and light now, even in just the universal church. Help us, Lord, just to be faithful to your text, not to deviate or stray from it, but to keep it, to observe it, to teach it, to practice it, so that all of us could be little Ezras, Lord, in service of your kingdom. We thank you, and we pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. All right.</p></div></body></html>
