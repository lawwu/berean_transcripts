He has volunteered to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=114s">00:01:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of spearhead what we are doing in India. So he is going to be our point person next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=119s">00:01:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">year and hopefully the other things that are going on. So he is going to be the guy as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=123s">00:02:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">far as India is concerned. So I appreciate him sharing about that. I didn't really get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=127s">00:02:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to share much about it and I am not planning to do part two about our missions this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=132s">00:02:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But every time I go out, obviously it is physically exhausting. It was a pretty long trip. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=139s">00:02:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">our flight and travel time was somewhere near 40 hours, about 38 hours or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=144s">00:02:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that and the 38 hours coming back. So every mission trip that we go, they usually take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=150s">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a picture of me knocked out somewhere. You know, whether in somebody's apartment or in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=153s">00:02:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the car and I think there was one in last week's slideshow. It is physically exhausting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is also very rewarding. You feel refreshed. Not that we don't do missions here. Not that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=167s">00:02:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't do evangelism here. But that one week, that 8 to 10, 9 days that we are out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=173s">00:02:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it is intensified obviously. So every ounce of energy that we have is being spent doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=179s">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">God's work. So by the time we get into our room, we just pass out and we wake up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=184s">00:03:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we start over again and then we come back. And I think the reason why, even though physically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=189s">00:03:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it is exhausting, we feel refreshed. I think everybody who has been out to missions will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=194s">00:03:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">testify to the same thing. That we feel refreshed because at the core of God's heart, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=201s">00:03:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where He is. Everything that we know of scripture is in the context of God pursuing sinners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=208s">00:03:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we say that we are followers of Christ, we are not saying that we adhere to certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=213s">00:03:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">doctrines. Of course that is part of it. When we say we are followers of Christ, we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=218s">00:03:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">not simply saying that we attend church or we serve the church. Of course that is part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=222s">00:03:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. But there is the most common sense application of when we say we are followers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=227s">00:03:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ, we are following Him. That is what we mean by we say follow. So I am following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=234s">00:03:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you.

So when we say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=241s">00:04:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we are followers of Christ, it means that we are going where He is going.

We are thinking what He is thinking. That is what it means to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=250s">00:04:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">follower.

How He pursued us and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=272s">00:04:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as a result of us being pursued and being saved, now we follow Him to pursue other sinners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=279s">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is what Jesus told His disciples when He said follow me, I will make you fishers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=281s">00:04:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of men.

In fact, all of scripture is written in that context.

But he is responding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=533s">00:08:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to these Jews who may have been thinking, "Well, if that's the case, where does that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=538s">00:08:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">leave us?" You know, for the Jews, the law was not just a part of who they were. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=544s">00:09:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was their identity that separated them from the world. So, if Paul, you're saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=549s">00:09:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the law doesn't distinguish us from the world, then who are we? What are you saying? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=556s">00:09:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's answering that question that the Jews naturally would have. For centuries, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=562s">00:09:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">believed that if they obeyed the law, that God's favor is going to be upon them. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=568s">00:09:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">their nation was going to be restored.

That they're in a higher plane than the rest of the world. And all of a sudden, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=575s">00:09:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "No, we're all, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." So, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=581s">00:09:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be focused on these three verses today, but I want to just, again, help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=585s">00:09:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">understand 9, 10, and 11.

One is that God is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=592s">00:09:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not done with Israel.

He never changes His mind. What He says, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=652s">00:10:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can bank on. And that's the second theme of chapter 9, 10, and 11. And so we'll get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=658s">00:10:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that. We're going to go through these passages, but I just wanted you to see the larger theme</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=665s">00:11:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of the three chapters that we're going to be covering. But today we're going to be looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=667s">00:11:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">at the first three verses. How does He introduce this? Well, if you look at it, again, read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=675s">00:11:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with me just the first verse. It almost seems like He's kind of disconnecting and starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=681s">00:11:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something new. But in actuality, He's asking a question that He already knows that these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=687s">00:11:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Jews probably were asking, or maybe even grumbling in their hearts. If what you said in chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=693s">00:11:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 8 is true, what about us? I am speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying. My conscience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=700s">00:11:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">bears me witness to the Holy Spirit. He hasn't said it yet, but in verse 1, He's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=706s">00:11:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">setting them up and saying, what I'm going to say is true. What He's about to say must</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=712s">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">be really, really important. Usually if you have a conversation with somebody and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=717s">00:11:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">want them to really pay attention, there's some conversations we can have and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=722s">00:12:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of wandering off and you can talk. It's not that important. But if you really have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=725s">00:12:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something you need to say, right? If you're a parent and you need to give instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=731s">00:12:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to your child and he's just kind of wandering off, he said, no, pay attention. Right? I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=736s">00:12:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not messing around. Listen to me. Look me in the eye. What did I just say? Right? This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=742s">00:12:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is Paul's version of telling the readers, pay attention. Listen, look me in the eye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=750s">00:12:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What I'm about to say is true. I am not lying. He says it in the positive and then the negative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=757s">00:12:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, he's confirming that I am not lying in Christ. The Holy Spirit bears witness and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=762s">00:12:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he invokes the two heads of the Godhead to say, what I'm about to say is absolutely certain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=768s">00:12:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's absolutely true. Now, why does he go about doing that? Because the easiest way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=776s">00:12:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to dismiss the gospel is to dismiss the messenger. Right? We do that in politics. If somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=784s">00:13:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">has an opposing view of politics, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, our natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=788s">00:13:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">knee jerk reaction, the easiest thing to do is before engaging in what we disagree on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=794s">00:13:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we say, oh, he's an idiot. He's a racist. That's why he believes that. He's been raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=801s">00:13:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this way. So we don't talk about this issue. If you nullify the speaker, then his message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=807s">00:13:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is nullified. We do that in politics and things that we disagree in. We do that oftentimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=813s">00:13:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">even in theological debates that we have. If you happen to go to that church, oh, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=818s">00:13:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you go to that church, you must be like that. You must be ignorant. You don't know anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=822s">00:13:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">about the Bible. That's why you attend that church. You believe this. You're Calvinist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=828s">00:13:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">No, you must hate people. You're an Armenian? Did you read the Bible? So even in the Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=837s">00:13:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">realm, if somebody has an opposing view, the easiest way to argue that is to dismiss the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=841s">00:14:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">person. He's dumb. He's stupid. His personality is this way. We don't really need to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=850s">00:14:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">about this issue. See, that's what Paul is dealing with. He preached the gospel and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=855s">00:14:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">was unsettling. He basically told them that everything that you thought about life was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=861s">00:14:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong. So the natural response is, this guy must hate the Jews. That's why he's saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=869s">00:14:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">what he's saying. Something must have happened to him. And I'll bet you there were conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=874s">00:14:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe Gamaliel was about to flunk this guy. And maybe that's why. Maybe he was up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=879s">00:14:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">promotion and he was going to sit in the Sanhedrin and they voted him out. Something must have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=883s">00:14:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. Why is he doing that? See, in order to answer his critics, he first says, "I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=890s">00:14:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">not lying. I am speaking the truth in Christ. My conscience bears witness." And what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=897s">00:14:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">he about to say? "I actually have sorrow and unceasing anguish. I don't rejoice of pointing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=904s">00:15:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">out that the Jews will be condemned under the law if they continue to go down this path."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=910s">00:15:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">See, our life, the way we live, it does matter. It does matter. You know why? Because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=918s">00:15:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel that was given to us is a hostile message in this world.

See, when we preach the gospel, it's turning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=941s">00:15:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the light on in the darkness. So the first reaction that oftentimes we'll get is, "They'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=946s">00:15:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">nullify you.

See, that's why we are told in 1 Peter 2.12, "Keep your conduct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=959s">00:15:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=966s">00:16:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation." What Peter is saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=972s">00:16:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is when you preach the gospel, they're going to accuse you of being evil.

And there's a reason why the scripture says the elder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=987s">00:16:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">must be above reproach.

The message that you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/204102938#t=992s">00:16:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to take to the world, they're going to accuse you of being a hater.
