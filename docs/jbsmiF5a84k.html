recommend that you guys take this class because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1178">00:19:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so much of what you are studying in the New Testament is connected to what's happening in the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1183">00:19:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a fulfillment of some of the, a lot of the things that are happening in the Old

Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1190">00:19:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can still understand the New

<span class="t">And so if you have, if you're not exactly sure about the timeline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1199">00:19:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about why the prophets are there and what is the content of this thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1202">00:20:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I strongly recommend, it's a four week class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1205">00:20:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's taught at 2 p.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1207">00:20:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have time for you to go and grab lunch and come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1210">00:20:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's about an hour long for four weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1212">00:20:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you haven't taken that, I strongly encourage you to take that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1215">00:20:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The other class being taught by Pastor Mark, that's also starting on 8/21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1220">00:20:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is only for three weeks, one hour at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1223">00:20:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is basically going over how to do inductive Bible study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1227">00:20:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1231">00:20:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's intimidating because to open up the Bible and then, and then instead of asking us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=1235">00:20:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what does this mean, you kind of dig through the

would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2359">00:39:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe we wouldn't have as rich of a knowledge

beginning of this narrative starts in verse 40, basically by telling us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2369">00:39:29.320</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2375">00:39:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That basically covers 12 years of his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2379">00:39:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He said he was continuing to grow, becoming strong, in wisdom, in the grace of God.</span></div><div

point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2386">00:39:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end of the narrative, verse 52, it describes the next 18 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2391">00:39:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">before he shows up as a full-grown adult at age 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2395">00:39:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2400">00:40:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's it. Those two phrases, that the beginning and the end, basically says similar things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2407">00:40:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Growing in wisdom, in favor of God, in favor of men, and that's what was going on up to age 12,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2412">00:40:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what's going on after the age of 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2414">00:40:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this story basically is sandwiched by those two statements that he's growing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2419">00:40:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">he's maturing, wisdom, favor, by the grace of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2423">00:40:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, age 12 and age 30 is not by accident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2429">00:40:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I already explained why Jesus shows up at the age of 30, because in the Levitical teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2435">00:40:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it says that 30 is the age where they considered you have experienced fullness of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2440">00:40:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it doesn't mean that you experience everything that you could possibly experience as a human being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2445">00:40:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus was not a father, he was never a mother, he was never a grandfather,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2448">00:40:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so it doesn't mean that every possible experience you could experience as a human being, Jesus experienced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2453">00:40:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But 30 years was enough to be able to live a full adult life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2457">00:40:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to say that now you can minister at the temple as an adult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2463">00:41:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the age of 12 was when they transitioned to adulthood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2468">00:41:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So Bar Mitzvah, as you guys know, is the Jewish community celebrates that as a transition into adulthood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2474">00:41:14.320</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">So from age 12 to 13 is a transition that takes place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2479">00:41:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the Bar Mitzvah was not introduced to the Jewish culture until after the time of Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2485">00:41:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but there was an understanding in the Jewish culture where the age 12 was the last year of your childhood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2492">00:41:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fact that age 12 is emphasized here is purposeful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=2497">00:41:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just random that we find story

passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3100">00:51:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where the parents are obedient, they lived according to the law, and it reveals to us that his parents were very faithful Jews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3109">00:51:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That they raised him in a godly home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3112">00:51:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">See, in the Jewish tradition, there's three specific festivals that was commanded for the Jewish men to come and attend in Jerusalem and go to the temple and celebrate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3122">00:52:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Those three festivals were the Passover, Pentecost, and the Tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3128">00:52:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But because of the diaspora, because of them being carried along to Syria, to Persia, to Babylonia, they were all spread out all over the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3136">00:52:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They couldn't make that journey all three times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3139">00:52:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, faithful Jews, not all Jews, but faithful Jews chose the Passover to be the day where they would make this travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3146">00:52:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">According to this passage, it says that they did this every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3151">00:52:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they stayed the full amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3155">00:52:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The Passover, although it's only one day, the Feast of Puth would come right after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3159">00:52:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they stayed for the whole thing, they would be staying somewhere around seven to eight days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3164">00:52:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a five day journey to get there, five day journey to go back, which means about 17, 20 days out of the year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3171">00:52:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they would pack up their bags and come to Jerusalem to celebrate this festival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3176">00:52:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they did this every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3179">00:52:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this time, the majority of the Jews did not practice this because it was too hard to pack up their bags and make this journey every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3187">00:53:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So one, it tells us that Jesus was raised in a very godly home who obeyed the commandments, all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3194">00:53:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also reveals about Mary, because the commandment to make this journey was only commanded to men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3201">00:53:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fact that Mary and all the children packed up their bags and they went together tells us something about Mary's faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3208">00:53:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">She was also faithful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3209">00:53:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, it's telling us that Jesus was raised in a very godly home with good examples of following the law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3215">00:53:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we talked about last week why this is being emphasized for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3218">00:53:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in every way, Jesus was obedient to the law, even as an infant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3223">00:53:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's in this context that we are told that Jesus gets lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsmiF5a84k&t=3228">00:53:48.320</a></span> | <span
