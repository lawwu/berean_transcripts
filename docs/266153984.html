father or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=155s">00:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have brother or sisters and you go to the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=177s">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the bigger question, even before we get to the male and female, is why is she considered unclean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=182s">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to begin with when something so sacred and so precious of delivering a child after going through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=189s">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">such just pain and to

as soon as the baby comes out, the Bible says that anybody that she touches becomes unclean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=202s">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then again, so we get to that distinction between male and female.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=211s">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's see if we can do our best to try to answer this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=218s">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Leviticus 11 dealt with the clean and unclean food, which was meat,</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1186s">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, obviously the second part of it is to restore her to ritual purity,</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1207s">00:20:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why would a woman bearing children make her unclean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1213s">00:20:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In every other circumstance, we would think that that period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1216s">00:20:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">she was probably more sacred and more honored and more special than any other time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1221s">00:20:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But why in the Israel law is she considered unclean at that time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1226s">00:20:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this command should not be regarded as something negative.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1235s">00:20:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so bearing children from God's point of view is unclean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1239s">00:20:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We shouldn't view it that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1240s">00:20:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember we talked about the distinction between unholy and unclean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1244s">00:20:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unholy is specific willful sin against God that needs to be repented of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1248s">00:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unclean is where God looks at it and it's just not pure in his eyes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1255s">00:20:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is obviously not unholy but

Adam and Eve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1264s">00:21:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to be fruitful and multiply, to have multiple children, Genesis 128.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1271s">00:21:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Psalm 127 verse 3, children are to be regarded as gifts from God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1278s">00:21:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in Psalm 123, a woman with many kids is considered to be blessed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1286s">00:21:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all throughout scripture, having children, having many children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1291s">00:21:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at least in the

having said that, what does this point to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/266153984#t=1304s">00:21:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember everything
