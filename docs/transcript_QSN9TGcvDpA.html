It would be pretty rough. But we had a nice break, and I'd be glad to see everybody back. Let's take a moment to gather our hearts to pray as we start off our Bible study tonight. Heavenly Father, we want to take a moment to go before you.</p><p>God, in every time that we get together in this way, we always want to lift up our heart of thanks to you. Lord God, thank you for blessing us so regularly, so lavishly, so freely. We also pray, God, that every time, you know, we're gathered together to study, we do pray that the time and discussion, the time and the study that we did at home, and even just hearing again the passage over and over, we pray, Lord, that you would make it fruitful.</p><p>God, that our hearts would bear the kind of response you desire to see. Cause us, Lord God, to be strengthened in the inside. And then now, Lord, as we lift up, you know, our song to you, we again pray that what we do, Lord God, would be an expression of our faith, that, Lord, we would lift up to you both our song, our voices, but also our hearts.</p><p>We thank you again. It's in Christ's name. Amen. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ >> If you are in the rooms, please make your way on out.</p><p>We'll gather for the teaching time. And then, you know, as a comment, you know, I know you guys pretty much are inductive Bible study pros. So from -- as we're doing this kind of rules on good Bible study practice, there are going to be principles that overlap and maybe feel like repeat.</p><p>But, you know, we want to continue practicing the various principles that we're learning today on the topic of Proverbs. I'm focusing on Proverbs, but obviously it's just -- there are wisdom texts throughout the scriptures. But primary being Book of Proverbs, then Lamentations. And so let's take a moment to pray, and then we'll jump into tonight's study.</p><p>Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace. We're grateful because we definitely feel regularly your fatherly love. As you are the good father, we know you instruct us, you give to us guidance, and thank you, Lord God, that you are not silent, but rather, just as every good parent, you speak to us eloquently, you speak to us closely, you speak to us in ways that we would understand.</p><p>We pray that as we study, you would grant to us the wisdom from above. Help us, Father God, to have minds that are being renewed, hearts that are being changed, and ultimately, God, we would make decisions in our lives that are honoring to you. We thank you. It's in Christ's name.</p><p>Amen. Okay. So as a way of review--sorry. As a way of review, last time I said prophecy and poetry, it's kind of interesting because prophecy, it comes with an intensity that to a very unique historical circumstance, God is proclaiming and speaking typically rebuke, typically a kind of wake-up call saying, "You're unfaithful to the covenant promises," and it's God's direct word to his people.</p><p>It's like shouting. And then when we read poetry, it's so different because it's typically praise and prayer from the people to God. It's their expression of love, expression of affection, and it's about the Lord speaking to the generations. And in that way, there's overlap because the book of Proverbs is also speaking to the generations.</p><p>The book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom. The book of Proverbs is a book of observation of the ways of God and the ways of man from one generation to the next. Much of the Scriptures in the book of Proverbs is attributed to King Solomon given to his young prince, young man, who needs to learn the instructions of God and heed the instructions of his parents.</p><p>Now, these are things that you guys are well aware of, but I want to review because this is where the interpretive mistakes come, okay? The typical mistakes when studying the book of Proverbs is that you get too extreme. What do I mean? Well, the book of Proverbs, when you look at the way that it's written, the book of Proverbs are truisms versus universal truth that's absolute in every sphere, every situation, and every circumstance, yes?</p><p>Doctrines about God that he knows all things, that's true no matter where you go, no matter what situation, all that kind of stuff, yes? But the reason why I say it's a truism is because you can find exception. That's why it's a truism. And if you take a moment to think about it, Scripture in the book of Proverbs chapter 21 tells us that those who love righteousness, those who seek love will prosper, yes?</p><p>But then you read the book of Job. Job is a wisdom book. And Job says, "I'm the exception. Satan had it out for me. God allowed it. And I didn't understand. As a matter of fact, I was pleading to God, like, 'Tell me why. What in the world is going on?'" Because the truism is, yes, those who seek righteousness and love, you're generally also loved.</p><p>But there are always exceptions. And then point two, it says, "There are norms and not exacting laws or rule because," I said earlier, "the interpretive problem comes when you go extreme." I'll give you an example. Proverbs chapter 22 verse 7 says this, "The rich rules over the poor and the borrower becomes a slave to the lender." Have you ever met somebody who has said, "It is a sin to borrow money.</p><p>It is a sin to take out loans. There are people who believe that." How would you argue against them? You would tell them, "Pastor Mark said these are norms. They're not supposed to be laws. We studied law. God was very, very exacting. If you do this, here are the consequences.</p><p>Here are the stipulations of your relationship with me. This is how you walk. That's law." Proverb is wisdom. It's guarding your heart against you constantly taking out loans. And, yes, there are people who habitually are in debt. Are they not? Are they not obligated? And so what you find, actually, that book of Proverbs, just like poetry, uses quite exaggerating or you could say metaphorical language to show you the plight, to show you the kind of pains that come from folly.</p><p>And then, obviously, we're thinking about the ways of God and not unconditional promises. So there are people who read the book of Proverbs like promises. And you could see why I say this because it's important and relevant to the passage we read. There are a lot of people who read chapter 3, verses 1 through 10 as exacting promises.</p><p>If I do this, this is what God has promised me. Is that the way you should read it interpretatively? Well, let's continue to discuss that. Moving forward, the purposes of the Proverbs is to show you the way and pattern of God and man. Some of the Proverbs you'll read and you're kind of like, "That sounds sarcastic," you know?</p><p>Some of the Proverbs you'll read and you'll read it like, "Is that a good attitude?" Well, our expectation shouldn't be every verse comes from the holiest, most godliest perspective, but rather the point wasn't that. It wasn't to teach you a moral. It was to show you how life is.</p><p>Does that make sense? Sometimes it's to show you the observation of the person giving Proverbs, like this is the way the world works, okay? All right, that being said, the purpose of Proverbs is to make us wise in our thinking, wise in our hearts, and ultimately wise in our character so that we are spared all the pains and all the snares that the generations before us have experienced, okay?</p><p>So when we think about this, I want to say as a reaction, as a first kind of instinctual reaction to the book of Proverbs, everything I just said now I hope you didn't take as to mean, so therefore, you know, don't take it so seriously. I hope you didn't think I was going to say that, right?</p><p>The book of Proverbs is wisdom sayings and it's observations. Therefore, don't take it too seriously. The exact opposite, okay? The book of Proverbs still is the wisdom from above, and the Scripture says in Proverbs 4, verse 7, "The beginning of wisdom is this, acquire wisdom. And with all your acquiring, get understanding." The book of Proverbs we should see as this is the most practical.</p><p>This is the most applicational book of the Old Testament, right? This touches upon every single practical element of my life, including my money, my time, my mouth, my lust, my desires, my ambitions, my work. It touches everything. And so the way we should be thinking about this book is I want as much of it as I can.</p><p>As a matter of fact, you know the book of Proverbs, it says, "Guard the truth and the wisdom that God gives you. Guard the instruction like it's your life." We should be hungry for it, okay? And therefore, a kind of approach, whereas with epistles, it's so still important that we take a look at every verse and we dissect it.</p><p>We start chopping it up into little segments, and we follow the flow of thought and all that kind of stuff. With the book of Proverbs, you know that we should be meditating. We should be thinking application. If you read the Bible and you don't do application, a lot of times people have said, "Then all you've done is think about stuff and lofty concept, and then it dies," right?</p><p>Well, the book of Proverbs says, "If you do that, you're a fool." Why? Wise living has to do with your skill, your skill of how you made decisions, your skill of how you matured, ultimately how you changed. And so, leaning heavy, the tip that I gave you in studying the book of Proverbs is the book of Proverbs actually is incredibly repetitive.</p><p>What you saw in chapter 3, you will see all through chapter 4, right? What you saw in chapter 4, you will see all through chapter 6. So, it's super repetitive. The question is, "Are you meditating deeply on this text?" Now, as a quick--another introductory remark on this, what is then meditation and how are we thinking through what meditation is?</p><p>Well, as the book of Proverbs typically has like one-line zingers and sometimes they'll have big block paragraphs, but they're truth bombs. It lands super heavy because it sometimes, in such a succinct way, identifies your problem, that kind of thing, right? We want to make sure we're meditating very deeply.</p><p>And the Hebrew term for meditate is not just to think deeply but to recite, to mutter, and to murmur it. You're kind of like retelling, retelling, retelling so that it is ruminating in your mind. What's more, in the Greek, it says to pay special attention, to attend to it carefully, to contemplate it deeply, and then to put it to practice, right?</p><p>Essentially, you're taking this truth and you're testing it here, testing it there, testing it here, testing it there. Does it fit here? Does it fit there? Does it fit here? And that's the kind of picture I want you to have with Proverbs. You want to kind of see actually--I word it funny in the document that I gave as a tip, which is like lean heavy on meditation and observation of the world, okay, meaning you should be looking at even people.</p><p>The Scripture says things like, "Do not speak in the presence of fools for when he hears your wisdom, he will scoff at you." Well, is that guy a fool? Is this guy--I'm just kidding. Sorry. Anyway, you should be taking that to test. Does this apply here? Does this apply there?</p><p>And then obviously, once you look at the world and wonder in what situations and circumstances apply, you're looking at yourself, "Am I the fool?" Okay? What's in my heart? This is the kind of way that we should be approaching Proverbs. Taking a look at our passage. Jumping now to this segment.</p><p>"My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments for the length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you." Okay. When I put it like this, I hope you guys in the back can see it. You guys can immediately appreciate the kind of pattern, right?</p><p>The kind of pattern that you see. Do you guys remember what kind of literary device this is? Anyone? Did I hear synonymous parallelism? Very good. Okay. That's what that is. Okay. You have two lines that are saying the exact same thing in different words. And you see it. The first is correction.</p><p>Don't do this. Don't forget. Don't let the truth leave you. And then the exhortation, bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart. And then the blessings, okay? And so when you see this, I would see it as one unit. So if I was making the outline of the text for today, verses 1 through 10, I would split it right there at verse 4 and say this is one thought at the beginning, and then the next thought has more to do with the trust and the honor and the acknowledging of God, right?</p><p>Okay. So when we look at this, I want you guys to do this. Remember that whenever we're doing then this kind of parallelism, he's obviously using that for you to, yes, meditate. You do one run-through, and then you do another. So then I ask you, how would you summarize into one singular concept what this passage is saying?</p><p>Any volunteers? Should I call on this table? Sorry. I just like to see you guys squirm and have your eyes avoid contact with me. Okay. The idea is just simply keep the commandments, right? God could have just said that. The Father could have just said that, right? Giving instructions like, "Dude, have you seen the Old Testament?</p><p>Just obey," you know? That could have been the word because that's the wise word to say. But why does it have all of these different devices, and why does it have all these different elements to it? Well, for us to just take a moment to meditate together on this, did you observe--I hope you did--not only the parallelism, but this whole negative and positive command, which is a device to focus you in and hone you in.</p><p>And I get this picture because if any of you have ever given instructions to a child, and you tell them, "Hey, you glue it like this," and then you realize they don't understand, so you have to say, "Not like that," right? And so you get humbled to realize you are that child.</p><p>Well, let me take a moment to just meditate with you. By thinking about the negative part of the command, it says, "Do not forget." And what's more, "Do not let kindness and truth leave you." And the first thing I thought as I reflected on myself is, "Dude, I am like the most forgetful person in this church." I am.</p><p>Did you know that there was a time someone wanted to borrow a book off my shelf and asked me, "Oh, shoot, did you read this? It looks good." And I said, "No, I never read that." And they opened it and said, "How come your pen mark and notes are all over it?" And I said, "Oh, shoot, I read that." I'm one of the most forgetful people I know.</p><p>And then he says, "But don't allow that to happen." There is such also a passive nature to who I am, isn't there? All of us. I imagine maybe if you put this into some kind of other scenario where the son is telling the father, "Oh, Father, she left me." And the father rebukes the son and says, "No, you let her go.</p><p>It's your fault. You were supposed to cling to her. You were supposed to cling to truth." The natural propensity of my mind and my heart is I get so distracted. I get so lost in my own thoughts. And as the days go by, I always tend to forget. And God has told us you have to cling to it like your life depends on it.</p><p>You have to exert that energy to keep it near you. Why is it that sometimes we just assume if I just sit back and listen to sermons, I'll be good? That's on us. And so when this passage commands us to bind these truths on our necks and write them on our hearts, question to you, how will you apply that?</p><p>How will you make application so for those of you who are just as forgetful as I am to not just simply allow your months, your years to go by? And it's kind of like even with young children in the spouse ministry. Actually, the parents are awesome because they take home the assignments and the papers and they'll always ask the student, "What did you learn?" And you guys know what happens.</p><p>I don't know. How will you as a mature adult prevent that from happening? How will you as an adult prevent the truth from just leaving you? And how will you apply? Yes, it's metaphorical, the binding on your neck and the writing on your heart. How will you apply that?</p><p>So obviously, that's a strong push in the text, and we have to meditate on it. The next portion, the next portion from verse 5 through 10. We're not obviously going to get to go through everything, but you see such a pattern again. Once you break it down into the poetic form and you start to do things like kind of indent segments, and you guys see my rationale into the indentation.</p><p>In the previous section, it was the negative command, "Don't." Then it was the exhortation command, "Do this, keep it." And then it was the motivation or the blessing. Likewise here, once you see that pattern, you realize, "Wow, this author is clearly building the whole thing in two verses each." Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean out on your understanding, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>One of the things that I ask you guys to do is whenever you see so many instructive words, you have to make a list, and you have to identify all of them. Not all the Proverbs are like this. Some of the Proverbs are like storytelling. Chapter 7, it's like, "Don't go near the crazy lady who's flirtatious, and her husband's gone, and she's going to say all this stuff." The command doesn't come until the end of the story.</p><p>It's like, "And if you go there, you're stupid." It's like a long story. Not all the Proverbs are like this, where it's just like, bam, bam, bam, instruction and command. When you see that, you have to be a good student and just list all of it. And then think, what are these commands pushing?</p><p>Is there a one singular emphatic command of these list of commands? Is there a rhyme or reason as you work through these commands? And so clearly, for me, I just started underlining, and I'm sure you guys did too, this idea is like, "Trust in the Lord. Do not lean on your understanding.</p><p>Acknowledge Him. Don't be wise in your eyes. Fear Him. Honor the Lord." And I'm not going to, for the sake of time, dive into this is what I think the progression is, but clearly there's this mounting weight of how we are to give our full confidence to God and entrust ourselves in such a way where we go from before just passively listening to the words and it just floats away, to now I'm filled with worship, to now where I'm proactively taking my first fruits and giving them to God.</p><p>Why? Because this individual who is receiving the instruction is maturing. But as you see the weight of the instructions, you also see the weight of the blessing. The equal parts are these are the commands, and then here are all the blessings. So just like we did with circling the commands and identifying and listing them, we should list off all the blessings because they're quite profound.</p><p>And we should ask the same questions. Is there any one of these blessings that stand out as an emphatic top blessing out of all the others? Is there kind of a cohesive way to think about all these blessings? One way to think about it is, man, in trusting God, you get everything.</p><p>You get the longevity. You get the favor. You get the direction, the clarity, the guidance, the straight and narrow path. You get the healing, the internal peace, and you get the abundance. That's everything good you could possibly think of. There is total security in trusting God. But here is the interpretive question.</p><p>Why? Because remember how I said that the interpretive error that comes from studying Proverbs is when you take the extreme. Who does this? Prosperity Gospel Preachers takes the extreme on this specific text. A long, long time ago, right after I graduated seminary, for some reason, when I had some time, I watched Prosperity Gospel Preachers.</p><p>And part of it was for fun because it was hilarious. Other parts of it was, you know, I preach against it heavy. I should at least listen to some of them. And it's wild because people like Joel Osteen, they'll actually say, "Everybody take your Bible." And they'll take it and they'll say, "I believe everything it says." And then they'll chant after him, "I believe everything it says.</p><p>I believe everything it says about God. I believe everything it says about me." And that's the stuff they say. And you're like, "Whoa, that's the same stuff I would say." And then they would open up to, I remember Joel Osteen specifically opening up to this text and saying, "You have to trust God with everything and with your whole heart completely, not just with some things." And you're just like, "Are you crazy?</p><p>That's what I would say." Until you get to this point where you realize. But then he says, "But in you giving yourself and surrendering to God, he will honor you." And then you realize, "Wow, this guy is so good at little pithy statements." These prosperity gospels are amazing at these one-liners, "Honor God, he'll honor you.</p><p>Let go, let God," and all this kind of stuff. And it's so catchy. And I realize that's how people get duped. It sounds so much like Proverbs. It sounds so wise. So how would you respond to that? And I'm guessing you will actually run into somebody who maybe is discontent.</p><p>It's like, "I've been faithful. I've been faithful to God. But I'm struggling so much, and I'm always stuck." They'll ask you, "What gives? What's up with Proverbs 3 1-10?" I mean, the weight of blessing and promise is so heavy. So the question is, to what extent can we hope for earthly blessings and prosperity as we live faithfully?</p><p>Well, one extreme on the suffering side is someone might be like, "No." 2 Timothy says, "Anybody who lives a godly life will be persecuted." Expect nothing but suffering. You're supposed to expect nothing. And basically, all your blessings are only in eternity when you die and leave this world. Is that what you believe?</p><p>Or do you lean kind of like, "Well, it does say you'll be blessed." Because we don't have time to go over everything, all I'm going to say is this. Obviously, I gave earlier the principle that the wisdom literature is not to be taken as a universal promise or laws of God, but that it's a way of God or pattern of life.</p><p>And I hope that when you're counseling somebody, don't say it like this. Don't be like, "Pastor Mark said that wisdom literature is not like that." But rather, give the kind of hope that says, "You know, the scripture is always right and true. The best, most glorious, the most blessed way is to trust God." I 100% believe it.</p><p>The scripture tells us that our eyes might not see it that way. Your body may not feel like that, correct? But 1,000% I believe when God says your inner peace, when God says your overall health, your inner bones, when God says your prosperity, all of that is in the sovereign hand of God and you need to trust him.</p><p>That's true. It is. I believe it. But just one more thought though is in the immediate context in our paragraph, in the context of the rest of Proverbs, and in the context of the whole Bible, we know the prosperity gospel is just idolatry, right? Because here, just in looking at the text that we have, what is the emphatic responsibility for me?</p><p>The emphatic responsibility for me is to just trust God. Trust him to the degree where I know that he's going to be true and faithful and I need to just honor him. The rest of that is just God's responsibility, right? That's the immediate context. But also, in the context of the rest of Proverbs, scripture teaches us, "Do not weary yourself to gain wealth.</p><p>Cease from your consideration of it. When you set your eyes on it, it is gone. For wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that flies toward the heavens." Okay? So I hope that that's kind of--I know nobody in here believes like prosperity gospel is true. Yeah, you know.</p><p>But will you run across some people who are kind of wondering like, "Man, I'm so stuck in life. Where are the answers?" And they remember singing Proverbs chapter 3. They remember hearing Proverbs chapter 3 because it's one of the most famous passages in the book of Proverbs. Yes? And they say, "Where is this?</p><p>Where is this promise of God? What will you say?" Right? "What will you say?" And my encouragement is I hope we can, just from the study, realize the admonition for us to meditate deeply, not on just simply the out-product of life, but rather meditating deeply on the call that's emphatic in the text.</p><p>I skipped over the slide. Right there in the middle where it tells us to trust in the Lord and to lean not on our own understanding. Yes? The whole segment that we're looking at, it actually points to it, that one line. You guys don't have to exactly know what a chiastic structure is, and you guys don't have to like, "Oh, is it here?</p><p>Is it there?" All that kind of stuff. Sometimes it pops out at you, and sometimes it doesn't, you know? But nevertheless, identifying these key literary devices helps us understand when it comes to our responsibility to live skillfully, the passage is telling us we have to trust the Lord with everything we've got.</p><p>Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much. Again, we thank you because when we meditated this past week during Passion Week, Lord, we know, Father God, that above and beyond just food for the day, above and beyond overthrowing the government or having our life so secure, you gave us yourself.</p><p>You gave us, Father God, access to you, so thank you. Here in Proverbs, we hear the same thing. God, we may be in despair. We may be poor. We may be in need of daily bread, but you call us to trust you with everything we've got. And I pray, Father God, that we would heed this wisdom.</p><p>I pray, Father Lord, that we would also experience it, that we would experience the joys where we no longer trust our own might or our power, but that we trust you. We thank you. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. So over here, next week is our last Lesson 10, and we're going to be studying Revelation Chapter 5, 1 through 14, okay?</p><p>The handout is—you don't have to, like, read in detail everything because it's going to be just a resource for you. I summarized. Here are the general principles of biblical hermeneutics that follows our historical, literal, grammatical way of interpreting things, and then also genre-specific hermeneutic rules, okay? Oh, no. What happened?</p><p>Okay. You know what? My discussion questions didn't update, so your small group leader should have them. I'm going to try my best to put this up here and put it on, but you guys can go ahead and go into your discussion time to discuss application, okay? Thanks, everyone. Thank you.</p><p>Okay, cool. Oh, sorry. you</p></div></body></html>
