href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=144s">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It really is the I am statement, because it is the I am statement that connects him to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=149s">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the I am God of Yahweh of the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span

missed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=158s">00:02:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole point of this, because as I said in the beginning of this, in the Greek composition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=163s">00:02:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of this word I am, it is the two

<span class="t">So the Jews clearly understood when Jesus was saying this that he was saying that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=181s">00:03:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is connected to or he is God himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=184s">00:03:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's different about the I am statements in the New Testament is that Jesus was actually</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=194s">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So every one of these I am statements is trying to correct what became normal to the Jewish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=200s">00:03:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=202s">00:03:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Much of it was a misunderstanding of who the Messiah was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=207s">00:03:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They were expecting Jesus or the Messiah to come and he was going to feed them, take care</span></div><div

stated in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=216s">00:03:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a particular historical context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=219s">00:03:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't have a curriculum of seven I am statements and decided that this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=223s">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that he needs to teach, you know, the seminary students so they can have this knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=228s">00:03:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Each one of these I am statements are given in a specific context that they had a misunderstanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=234s">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or expectation of what they thought the Messiah was going to be and Jesus was correcting them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=240s">00:04:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a correct understanding of the I am is that he is the bread of life, that he is the light,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=245s">00:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">he is the door, he is the shepherd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=247s">00:04:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you remember, we've gone through two I am statements already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=251s">00:04:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the I am the bread of life and the context in which he says that is after he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=255s">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">feeds the 5,000 and they're looking for more bread and Jesus says I am the bread of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=262s">00:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Last week we talked about in the resurrection, Jesus says I am the resurrection and the life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=266s">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He says that in the context of raising Lazarus because they wanted him to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=272s">00:04:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in that context he says no, it is not just because he has breath, he says I am the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=278s">00:04:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">resurrection and the life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=280s">00:04:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So today's statement, I mean we've already gone through two, this is actually the third,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=285s">00:04:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but out of the seven, this is the second, out of the seven statements where he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=288s">00:04:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I am the light of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=291s">00:04:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It is also within a specific historical context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He wasn't just saying this out of the blue into the air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=298s">00:04:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at chapter seven, again I'm not going to turn there, but if you look at chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=302s">00:05:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seven, he says this in the context at the end of one of the Jewish's seven major feasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=312s">00:05:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact it happens to happen at the very end of their calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=316s">00:05:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The beginning of their calendar starts with the Passover and then the seventh and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=320s">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">last of the festivals was called the feast of booths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=324s">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of your translations may have feasts of tabernacles and it was the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=328s">00:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They consider this probably the biggest of their ceremonies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=332s">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we would naturally think that it may have been the Passover, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=336s">00:05:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Jews celebrated this in a big way because it was connected to two specific things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=343s">00:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=344s">00:05:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">One, it was the celebration at the end of the harvest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=349s">00:05:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can kind of think of it as their Thanksgiving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=352s">00:05:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But after the harvest they would collect all the fruits and all the bounty that they had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=356s">00:05:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from the harvest and they would take that and then all throughout the week they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=359s">00:05:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have these big festivals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=361s">00:06:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They would have families gather together and have these huge festivals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=365s">00:06:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was like a Thanksgiving and this lasted for about eight days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412653886#t=369s">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And during these eight days, one

what we want to do this morning is to look at three aspects of what this light represents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
