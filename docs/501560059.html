href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=84">00:01:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so when I started the sermon, I was planning to cover the three verses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=91">00:01:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">My goal is not to go one verse a week, but the three verses that we're looking at covers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=97">00:01:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the history in Genesis, almost 40 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=101">00:01:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could just kind of skim over and say, "This is what faith looks like," you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=105">00:01:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are some examples of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=108">00:01:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can just kind of dive in and review over what's going on in Genesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=112">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously I've chosen to do the latter, and I think it's beneficial for us to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=117">00:01:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the historical context in which this is going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=120">00:02:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the text that we're looking at, it really is covering over about two and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=125">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chapters, and then the other two men that are mentioned, Jacob and Joseph, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=129">00:02:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be covering about 12 to 13 chapters each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=132">00:02:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it would be beneficial for us to know what's going on in Genesis so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=136">00:02:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau," regarding things to come, that we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=140">00:02:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what he's talking about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=143">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of just assuming you know the story, I think it'd be good for us to review it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=146">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and it'll help us to understand better why he says what he says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=150">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right off the bat, we're looking at verse 20, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=156">00:02:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">even regarding things to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=158">00:02:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That verse, if you just skim through it and you didn't ask any questions, that's enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=162">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's consistent with everything else he's saying in chapter 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=167">00:02:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you've ever read through the history of what's going on behind this verse, it causes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=173">00:02:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">us to take a step back and question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=177">00:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Isaac was involved in probably one of the greatest highlights in the redemptive history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=181">00:03:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">where the sacrifice and then saving him from that was a type of what Christ was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=186">00:03:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do, and we saw the Father's heart through Abraham and the things that he was going through,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=191">00:03:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of that to point to us, to strike in us about what God himself was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=196">00:03:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do with his own son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=197">00:03:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And Isaac was the recipient of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=199">00:03:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And Isaac was not a young child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=203">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people think he could be as young as 14 or 15 or as old as 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=208">00:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he wasn't a little kid where he didn't understand what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=212">00:03:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that same guy, you would expect that after that great event, his life would be kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=218">00:03:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he takes the baton and then his faith grows even further than that, and then he's able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=223">00:03:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to do even greater things than Abraham because he had the benefit of a godly father who went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=228">00:03:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through all that he went through and then just passed it on to his son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=233">00:03:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, it causes us to look at Isaac plus Jacob.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=239">00:03:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If you know anything behind that story, it's like, what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=244">00:04:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All of redemptive history happened like that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=248">00:04:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, we'll review what is happening here, but I think it's important for us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=253">00:04:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">uncover that we don't look at something, especially in the Bible, like we don't fully understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/501560059&t=258">00:04:18.880</a></span> |
