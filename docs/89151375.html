become more and more sanctified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=229s">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I wanted to start off with that because really, I do feel this sense, you know, this is a later point but I want to bring it up right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=242s">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is common in our Western Christian culture that if you've been a Christian for, what, 10, 15 years, that for some odd reason you, like, lose the passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=257s">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For some odd reason, rather than growing step by step in greater desire, greater thirst, more hunger, it's just commonplace where it's, no, actually they become tired, weary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=271s">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They become, you know, not so active, not so passionate, not so, whatever it may be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's completely opposite to what the Scripture expects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=281s">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's completely opposite to what the Scripture is trying to push, inspire, and motivate us to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=287s">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we really have to, as a generation maybe, as a culture on the Western side, I don't know what it, to put a finger on it, I don't know exactly what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=297s">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is actually a huge problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is it that Christians, after year after year, rather than progressively growing, you see a diminishing of their passion?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=307s">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That should not be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's one of the reasons why I want to start off with the motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=314s">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Today I hope more than just like a theological exercise of, "Oh, this is what sanctification is."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=319s">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted it to be an element in which, yeah, I never want to see a Christian think, "I am mature now because I've got a couple things settled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=330s">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I no longer drink or smoke or cuss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=333s">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I come to church faithfully, I'm done."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=336s">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they just come, attending every Sunday thinking they're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is not the Christian life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=343s">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, you know, because I, again, have seen different cultures and different churches where there's plenty of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=349s">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sad part about it is, I see some of my parents' generation where they think like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got our work settled, we've got our job, you know, situated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=357s">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got our family situated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=359s">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then now we've got our church life situated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=361s">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like to live this kind of coasting life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=365s">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is not the kind of, like, push and desire that the Scripture is communicating to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=371s">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The passages that we just read in 1 Thessalonians and 2 Peter is more on the lines of, "Excel all the more."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=378s">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have every single reason to pursue greater holiness, to pursue greater sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=384s">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the message that we're hearing today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=387s">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we do have to define what sanctification is because in our day there also has been some confusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=394s">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=396s">00:06:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely just thinking about the sanctification-wise, as we're thinking about the process of salvation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=402s">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we're coming across a point in what's about the salvation experience where we talked about how God starts everything from election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=410s">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about how God is the one who, you know, gives the gospel call, the effectual call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=417s">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's the one who regenerates so that you can receive that call, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=424s">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are all things that God does on His part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=427s">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we talked about conversion in which we have then also the role of repenting and turning in faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=434s">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have the adoption that God again gives us the right to become children of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=440s">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here you can almost say,

concise definition of sanctification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=453s">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification is a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=457s">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a cooperative work that makes us more and more free from sin and like Christ in

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=465s">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole idea is if you want to put it in a simple way, the definition of sanctification is just growing in the likeness of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=472s">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div

growing more and more like Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/89151375#t=493s">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div
