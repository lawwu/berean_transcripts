Amen. As we enter into time of worship, you can stay seated so we can see the lyrics. Thank you. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, King of creation. All my soul praise Him for His health and salvation. All ye who hear now to His temple drum, praise Him in loud adoration.</p><p>Praise to the Lord. Praise to the Lord who all things so wondrously reigneth. Shelters thee under His wisdom so truly sustaining it. Hast thou not seen how thy desires have been? Converted in all that He ordained. Praise to the Lord who doth prosper and work and defend thee. Surely His goodness and mercy continually attend thee.</p><p>Wonder anew what the Almighty can do. With His love He befriend thee. Praise to the Lord. Praise to the Lord, O let all that have seen Thee adore Him. All that hath life and that cometh, praises before Him. Let the amen sound from His people again. Godly for aye, we adore Him.</p><p>Let the amen sound from His people again. Godly for aye, we adore Him. Through the nations reach, kingdoms rise and fall. There is still one King, reigning over all. So I will not fear, for this truth remains. And by God it is the ancient day. None above Him, none before Him, all the time in His hands.</p><p>For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the ancient mighty. Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul, He is here with me. I am not alone, for His love is sure. And He knows my name, for my God is the ancient mighty.</p><p>None above Him, none before Him, all the time in His hands. For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the ancient mighty. Though I may not see what the future brings, I will watch and wait for my Saviour King.</p><p>My true God will stand the age to face. And the presence of the ancient mighty is. None above Him, none before Him, all the time in His hands. For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the ancient mighty.</p><p>Let's pray. God, we just lift up worship to You, because You alone are worthy of our praise. God, and as we sing, we just hold on to this truth, God, that Your love is sure, that it will never fail, that it will never change. God, as we just gather here to begin another session, Lord, would You truly renew in us just a heart of worship?</p><p>Would You cause us to truly desire Your Word, to truly grow in likeness of You in Christ? Father, I just pray that You would just bless every group that's gathered here, that every time we gather, You would just let it be fruitful, that Your Word would transform us, God.</p><p>And ultimately, Your name would be just glorified and magnified in our church, God. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. All right. So, you know, again, excited. Welcome, everybody, to this new session of the Bible study. Just as a kind of reminder that our cafe is going to be open early.</p><p>And so you guys are totally welcome to come, get situated, even bring your dinner, because as the group here on Wednesday night is quite large, it takes some time for us to get kind of situated into our place. So please take advantage of that. And then I know some of you guys are just like rushing over from work, so glad you're here.</p><p>But just as an encouragement or reminder, please come early so that we can start right on time singing praises together. Okay. Taking care of some logistical notes and highlighting some announcements for all of us. First, we're really grateful for all of you guys over the sessions volunteering so that we take care of all the logistical needs from parking to set up, etc.</p><p>So please go ahead and use this QR code. We're encouraging all of you guys to sign up for the rotation, taking a part in lending a hand. We do need people to sign up for both set up and then when the Bible study is done for cleanup as well.</p><p>So go ahead and sign up for that. Also, as our church is just blessed with a lot of kids, and that number is growing, especially our home group ministries and even our ministry here, we do need volunteers for child care. So obviously for Wednesday night, you would need to sacrifice one of the sessions.</p><p>But also our home groups meet on different nights, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And so please go ahead and use that link there to volunteer to take care of the children throughout the week. The other announcement is that for those of you guys who are parents here, as you know, the children are being watched and taken care of there in the Sprouts area up top on the sanctuary side.</p><p>But please make sure to pick them up by 9.30. Some of you guys are going real good with conviction in that discussion. And the kids are over there like, "Did my parents leave me?" So you got to go pick them up 9.30. Another important announcement for you guys is that this Sunday is Communion Sunday.</p><p>So please make sure to take extra time to pray, take time to confess any sins, and then come ready to observe the Lord's table together for all three services this Sunday. And then finally, the men's ministry. Again, from the high school men to anybody that both members and non-members are welcome to come.</p><p>It is $10. There's going to be some light refreshments and then lunch provided. So please come for a time of fellowship. We're going to be praying, learning, and fellowshipping together. So make sure you sign up. If you sign up past this Sunday, there will be a late fee attached to that, so it will be $15.</p><p>So what we're going to do is go straight into discussion time. My encouragement is if you have a lot of new people within your group, just take some time to get to know each other. But per usual that we do on The Bible Studies, that passage in 1 Corinthians 13, share questions about the text, share your observations about the text, and just spend time just talking about that text together.</p><p>Then we'll come back for the study. For today or this series, please come back. I know it's going to feel like a little bit less time, but at 7.50, please come back so that we can do the teaching time, okay? All right. Hope you guys have a good discussion.</p></div></body></html>
