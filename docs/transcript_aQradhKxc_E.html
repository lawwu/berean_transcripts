Welcome to Breen Community Church. We have announcement from our college ministry. Pastor Nate's gonna come up here and give the announcement. >> Okay, good morning, everybody. If you are of the college age, we will be having next Sunday after third service. So we're saying 1.30, but it's gonna be directly after third service over there in the youth chapel, a welcome event.</p><p>And at this welcome event, we hope that you're able to join us, because we're going to be explaining some of the events, how college ministry kind of works, when we have our Bible studies, how to get rides, things like that. So if you can come to that, we'll be providing food for you.</p><p>And you'll be able to meet some of our staff, our small group leaders. And hopefully I'll be able to meet you as well. So it's after third service. This is second service. So you would have to, if you come to this service, wait until after third service. But please do put that in your calendars.</p><p>Make it something that you set to go, because it's going to be very helpful for us to get to know you, but also for you to get to know this church. So hope to see you there next week. Thank you. >> All right, a reminder, next Sunday is Communion Sunday.</p><p>So please prepare accordingly before you come. Next Sunday, there's a Vine, our youth group lunch fundraiser. And they're raising funds for the retreat that's coming up. It will be Mediterranean chicken bowl, they say, and $10 for adults and $5 for kids. And, again, we do this every time we have a members meeting.</p><p>So following the lunch, we're going to have our church members meeting. Our new members will be presented. And also, again, there's going to be a service fair at church. So after our members meeting, we're going to be going out to the courtyard, and you can visit and see what kinds of ministries are out there, how you can get involved.</p><p>So that's happening at 2 p.m. So the lunch will be preceding that so that you don't have to go out. And afterwards at 2 p.m., we're going to be having members meeting. And then women's ministry event, that's happening on October 19th on Saturday, 8:30 a.m. It's going to be in this room.</p><p>And, again, if you haven't signed up, the cost of it is $10. So please sign up for that, and, again, on October 19th at 8:30 in this room. That's a Saturday. And then, finally, family ministry picnic on Sunday, October 20th. And they're going to be holding it from 11 to 3.</p><p>So it's kind of an open event, just opportunity to meet other family ministry members. So you can just grab your lunch and go to Bill Barber Park. And you just need to show up, and there will be other family members there that you can get to know them better.</p><p>It's a casual opportunity just to see who's in the ministry. So this is open for anybody in this ministry. So it's going to be from 11 to 3 p.m. at Bill Barber Park. So if you brought a physical offering, again, our physical offering box is in the back to the right as you're exiting the sanctuary.</p><p>But otherwise, for the rest of us, let me pray for us, and we'll give you a minute to give your offering electronically. Then afterwards, our brother Dominic is going to come up and give his testimony and be baptized this morning. Let's pray. Father, we praise you and thank you for this morning and for all that you are doing that we know of.</p><p>Many things, Lord, that you're orchestrating behind the scene. And we pray, Father God, that as you drew us to yourself and opened our eyes to see who you are, that you continue to allow us to see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory so that all that we do will be an overflow of the powerful work that you are doing in us.</p><p>I pray that even in this giving, I pray that you would bless us, remind us, Lord God, that ultimately all of it is yours, and that our act of giving would be an expression of our love, our worship, and our lordship to you. May it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue our service.</p></div></body></html>
