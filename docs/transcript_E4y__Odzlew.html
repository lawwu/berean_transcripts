that in Ezekiel chapter 11 verse 22 then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them and the glory of God of the God of Israel hovered over them the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city and that's talking about that Mount of Olives that when Israel had been faithless and faithless and faithless time and time again God had used foreign nations, foreign occupation to bring about his judgment and wrath upon his very own people and he made it very clear that it was by his hand that these foreign nations would be coming but he says that one day he will come back and he leaves in this very same place that he says he'll return but it's because of their faithlessness it continues then I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me then the word of the Lord came to me saying son of man you live in the midst of the rebellious house who have eyes to see but do not see ears to hear but do not hear for they are a rebellious house therefore son of man prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by a day in their sight even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house and he's talking and he's talking to his own people he's saying seeing they don't see hearing they don't hear and that this is why God's glory left them this is why they were left under foreign occupation and so as these exiled Israelites and Ezekiel await a Messiah king to come and ultimately to rescue them it's going to be at the Mount of Olives in which they're expecting this Messiah to come from this this is very very exciting think about it put yourself in the shoes and in the position of these Israelites it's very exciting because the disciples are seeing all the signs they're seeing all the prophecies and these things are flashing before their eyes it's what causes Peter to correctly identify Jesus as the Christ the son of the living God and though we we see it you we see it you know it's it's very wrong the way it came about but James and John's mother it's the reason why she said please let my sons be on the left and right of Jesus when in the kingdom when the kingdom comes and so the time feels right they're all feeling and all the disciples are feeling this the climax coming here everything has been culminating to this point that we're reading in Matthew chapter 21 and this is the very area Mount of Olives where Jesus directs the two disciples to go in find a donkey colt with his mother and this kicks off two prophecies and we're mainly going to look at these two prophecies today the first prophecy is from Zechariah chapter 9 and it's speaking of a king who comes and strangely enough gentle and humble the king the Messiah coming in to conquer what was what was understood but right in the middle of Zechariah you're going to see this idea of him coming humble and gentle so we see it in Matthew 21 verse 4 this took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet say to the daughter of Zion behold your king is coming to you gentle and mounted on a donkey even on a colt the foal of a beast of burden and so now to direct your attention to Zechariah this prophecy in Matthew is very very well understood this was a popular messianic prophecy from Zechariah and Zechariah was a prophet who came after the Israelites returned from exile to Babylon but they were still under foreign occupation and so and so the Israelites were still waiting for salvation they were still waiting for a Messiah and they believe that God had left them because of their faithlessness and they would have been correct in that belief now this prophecy comes from Matthew a Zechariah chapter 9 right before Zechariah chapter 9 we have Zechariah chapter 8 here's what it says in verse verse 13 thus says the Lord I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem thus says the Lord of hosts behold I am going to save my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem and they shall be my people and I will be their God and truth and righteousness so this makes complete sense to them this falls right in line with what they're thinking that the Messiah is going to come and deliver them and there's a lot more language that I didn't I didn't put all the text here there's a lot of language of God's wrath that's coming his judgment that is going to come and he is going to save his people from them and it's here that the Lord where it says that he will he will he will come in in a wrath that that can't even be understood the very last chapter of Zechariah Zechariah chapter 14 it says this then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle in that day his feet will stand and here it is his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which is in front of Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south then the Lord my God will come and all the and all the holy ones with him so so when Matthew conjures up this this Zechariah 9 passage Zechariah was a very understood prophet and they'd be thinking of all of this that God is going to come to save us from foreign occupation this is the mindset the Israelites were in as they were waiting for the Messiah and here they were in in Matthew 21 at the foot of the very mountain everything culminating everything exciting building up but the passage Matthew uses is Zechariah 9 9 and he says in Zechariah 9 9 rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout and triumph O daughter of Jerusalem behold your king is coming to you great right and and then the twist the mystery where he says he is just and endowed with salvation humble and mounted on a donkey and he says I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will speak peace to the nations like what you're supposed to bring judgment on the nations it says he will speak peace to the nations and his dominion will be from sea to sea how do those two things jive peace to the nations but dominion from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth now this is unexpected this is very mysterious because the king is coming to defeat the nations but he is coming as a gentle humble king mounted on the colt of a donkey specifically a donkey perhaps raised for labor remember who we're talking about we're talking about sovereign God remember how God saves remember his power what they would have understood was that this is the God who with the ten plagues were able to conquer all of Egypt who before Sennacherib and the Syrians wiped out an entire army with one blow who confused all of mankind in a battle in the tower of Babel who is able to make a worldwide flub come and wipe out all of humanity the one who can make the earth open up and swallow the rebellious the one who creates the word with his the world with the with the word of his power Zechariah prophesies that the Lord is going to come humble that's very very this I don't know what the word to use it's it's it doesn't fit he would not come as a warrior on a war horse he's he's going to come in on a donkey how does this make sense if you look carefully at this prophecy you'll see in verse 10 there that the Lord will indeed cut off the chariot the horse the bow from all the nations he's going to conquer and he's going to bring peace not just to Jerusalem but what does he say to the whole world that was always his purpose even for the Israelites what they understood was that he was going to he was going to choose the nation of Israel but for them to what to bring blessing to the nations that was the whole point so why is this conquering going to be done in humility because this is the only way that God can accomplish the salvation of the world to to save the world so God did not come to defeat men but he came to save men his point even in raising up of Israel was to bring blessing to bring salvation to the ends of the earth and all of this for a singular end to bring glory to himself so that all might know him if we're believers all the worship and glory that comes up out of us is heightened by the fact that he saved us the Israelites were awaiting a king who would come and destroy all their enemies but this is not what God came for the Messiah king they received is from John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for God did not send the son into the world to judge the world but that the world might be saved through him so the Messiah king was going to come in humility on a meek beast of burden and this was clearly stated for the to the Israelites for all of these years but they weren't able to comprehend what it meant even though Jesus was trying to tell his disciples all this time that what he came to accomplish so here comes this Jesus on this colt from the Mount of Olives the Messiah king the excitement continuing to increase in his disciples can you imagine their hearts this is it and they see these unfurling of prophecies and it moves us into the second prophecy stated in the Psalm Psalm 118 prophecy and it shows us a king who comes to save chapter 21 verse 6 through 9 their narrative states the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them and brought the donkey and the colt and laid their coats on them and sat on the coats and he sat on the coats most of the crowd spread their coats in the road and others were cutting branches from the trees spreading them in the road the crowds going ahead of him and those who followed were shouting shouting Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest you can see the culminating excitement not only in the disciples but now the disciples are beginning to see that the exact thing that they were seeing the crowds were seeing remember what time of year this was this was the Passover remember what the Passover was when God came in and saved them from the Egyptians from foreign occupation the crowd is in a frenzy right now they're throwing their coats on the road they're cutting off palm palm branches they're worshiping at the top of their lungs shouting this interesting phrase Hosanna to the son of David before we get into the psalm a really interesting note in first Kings first Kings is a time before King David dies and they're about to coronate Solomon literally the son of David as king and this is what it says this is King David King David said to them take with you the servants of your Lord and have my son of Solomon ride on my own mule and bring him down to Gihon all of it by the way and this is interesting because this is how Solomon is introduced to the Israelites as the next king as the next king as David is about to die he comes riding in on this mule to a crowd that was hailing him as king in fact the first Kings 1 40 we don't I don't have that one for you here but he kept reading it says the earth was shaking at their noise and Solomon's first acts you read chapter 2 you read chapter 3 Solomon's first act is to clean house pronouncing the judgment of death on those servants who are unfaithful and then he builds the temple of God right where Jerusalem stood and that sounds pretty familiar and will continue to sound familiar this week and so there is prophecy being fulfilled here and we have here in Matthew the people beginning to shout this phrase Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord and here he comes much no not marching here that he's on the top of the donkey this is from Psalm chapter 118 that phrase Hosanna Psalm chapter 118 Psalm 118 what you need to know about that is it's the last song in a collection of six songs chapter 113 to chapter 118 is a collection of songs and that collection of songs they saying you know when every Passover so it was on their minds and they sing it during Passover because Hosanna makes sense when you're thinking back to Passover and Hosanna made sense because they were still waiting for a Messiah and the Messiah had entered in and the crowds were rocking the ground of Jerusalem here's what it says in Psalm 118 10 all nations surrounded me in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off they surrounded me yes they surrounded me in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off they surrounded me like bees they were extinguished as a fire of thorns in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off cut them off by the way is so important to understand about Jesus's crucifixion you push me violently so that I was falling but the Lord helped me the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation and so here you see shades of Zechariah that the expectation was for the Lord to come and rescue them from foreign powers and establish his people it further emphasizes what the Israelites were expecting but similar to Zechariah look what's nestled in nestled in there Psalm chapter 118 verse 22 just incredible the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone that's incredible that that's in there oh Lord do save that's Hosanna we beseech you oh Lord we beseech you do send prosperity blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord we have we have blessed you from the house of the Lord where Zechariah surprisingly talks about the Messiah being a gentle meek king coming in on a donkey here there's something even more startling the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone that is that the very people who are awaiting Christ are are going to be the very people who will reject the Christ they were singing that song where Zechariah surprisingly talks about this gentle Messiah we see it this even more startling truth that the prophecy is stating that he'd be rejected and there and then as we look at this this passage in Matthew if you were to keep going it just the startling nature of it just keeps rocking you in fact the parable that he speaks right after the triumphal entry is the one with the landowner if you're if you're familiar with this parable it's the one with the landowner and basically he gives a vineyard and rents it out to these farmers before he leaves on a journey and and when harvest time comes he sends his servants to go and collect his share but the tenants what do they do many of us are familiar with this they will beat some and they killed others right and those were supposed to represent the prophets that were pointing right and then what does he do at the end he sends his son his very own son it's almost absurd like they're killing your servants why would you send your son but it says perhaps they'll listen to him but the tenants they kill the son and Jesus ends by asking what is the owner going to do and the listeners do that the owners would punish the tenants and what give the vineyard to others who would receive if you read like what emanates out of that parable it's in Matthew 21 for 42 Jesus said to them do you did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected this became the chief cornerstone this came about from the Lord and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I say to you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing the fruit the fruit of it now imagine the Israelites as they're listening to Jews as they're listening to this they know Psalm 118 they know what he's quoting there they just saying Hosanna and he comes and sings and says this parable to them he says he who falls on the stone will be broken to pieces but on whomever it falls it will scatter him like dust when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables they understood that he was speaking about them when they sought to seize him they feared the people because they considered him to be be a prophet in the middle of their singing their glory to God they didn't realize that these prophecies were coming to light right before their eyes that the Messiah that had been talked about the son of David the humble and gentle king returning on a a cult would come to a city that would sing his praises and then and then crucify him he came to save the very people who would kill him they thought that God's wrath was for the foreign nations but God's wrath is on much more than that God's wrath is on all unrighteousness it's on sin it's on wickedness God did not come to give these Israelites what they were demanding that what they wanted was to be out of foreign occupation to be given their own land to be given their own riches to be given their own own own legend they wanted to have a place for their families they wanted to live their lives and so they were saying praise God because we can worship a God like that and when he became not the the Messiah that they were expecting they instead of just rejecting they killed him because that is the end of wickedness that is the end of sin that is the end of evil God's wrath is on much more than foreign occupation they they didn't realize that they needed to be saved from their very own sin and that the salvation would have to be from the very hand of God himself they were the enemies of God they had no idea what they were singing when they were saying Hosanna save us Matthew Matthew 21:10 it concludes when he had entered Jerusalem all the city was stirred and that word isn't strong enough it's the word riotous saying who is this and the crowds were saying this is a prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee and so the passage here concludes with them asking this question who is this of course they know who he is Jesus from Nazareth everyone's heard about him they're trying to core make him king but we but we know that they didn't know him but we know Jesus in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 through 2 it says God after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son that God has sent prophet after prophet Zechariah after psalmist to tell who Jesus was that this is what the Messiah is going to look like that he is going to come as a conquering king but he will be humble and he will be rejected but in these last days this is the culmination of it no more prophets he will speak through his very own son that's what that's what passion week is about he came to preach his life becoming the words of the gospel themselves God has been speaking to his people all through this time it was their sin that caused that veil to be over their eyes they thought that they'd be safe from earthly conquerors to be given earthly prosperity but they did not see that their true enslavement was not to men but to their own sin and that's why testimony after testimony person going under water after going under water gives a testimony that says that I was not saved from my depression or my loneliness or something like that that I was not saved from from a bad life and now I have a good life I was saved from my sin they didn't see that prosperity wasn't in the things of this world they didn't listen generation after generation after generation God speaking to them miracle after miracle prophecy after prophecy trying to get your attention paying the just the painful way in which is long-standing patience and grace and compassion just just just over and over and over again Jesus should have coming in just ridden in on a war horse pronouncing judgment destroying destroying the sinful he should have destroyed yes yes he should have destroyed the Egyptians and the Philistines and the Greeks and the Romans the Babylonians and the Assyrians he should have destroyed them all but he should have also destroyed all of the Jews perhaps there's even more than more responsibility they were given the promises the law they were given the prophet after prophet he should have come and destroyed them all and he doesn't it doesn't end there he should he should this have come in destroying everyone the America should be destroyed Canada Mexico Russia and Ukraine should be destroyed Russia not only Russia but China North Korea South Korea everywhere destroyed destruction in one terrifying swoop he should have come in to bring peace and justice into this land to get rid of the very problem itself us but he doesn't do that do that Palm Sunday is wild he doesn't do that he doesn't say that John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we saw his glory glory as of the only begotten from the father full of grace and truth he came to preach the gospel so he did not come in on a war horse he came in on a donkey God's words were falling on deaf ears and so he came inexplicably yet yet again the clearest way he sent sent servant after servant prophet after prophet and his people beat and killed them and he still sent his son God's love is like this and this is what we're going to see night after night this week and then we're going to wake up very early next week and be a little angry because it's early and then we're going to come here and we are going to marvel together and worship together and glorify God together because everything that we know is being seen on this week is about how he came and saved us because he loved us this week is when the son of man marches day by day step by step to save the people from sin John 13:1 just just pulls it together so nicely now before the feast of the Passover Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he would depart out of this world to the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end he didn't sit there and say well I tried you know God should have done that God should have done that faithlessness after faithlessness I tried and who can fault God he went way above and beyond it makes no sense it's incomprehensible that he did it again and again and again and again we should have stopped you know well to the judges but he didn't say well I tried he didn't say they didn't listen it says in John that he he loved them to the bitter end every drop of the cup of God's wrath that ought to have been poured out upon the nations poured out upon the sinner he loved them to the bitter end God loved us while we were enemies God loved us while we were sinners as the Israelites were mistaken that they thought it was outside of them the salvation that needed to come we have we have to be careful in our knowing of who God has come against do you remember when Jesus approaches Samaria and Luke chapter 9 verse 54 it says when his disciples James and John saw this this is Samaria they said Lord do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them but Jesus turned and rebuked them and said you do not know what kind of spirit you are of for the son of man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them just incredible isn't it this is the king that came into the world this is what the king is like this is what God is like he desires for none to perish and for all to come to repentance this is what we'll be seeing this is what we'll be seeing in this passion week we can marvel at this that he is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love to the unlovable to the enemy to the wicked to the vile everything if we could bottle up passion week and everything that Jesus went through all the mocking all the scorn all the shame all the sin bottle bottle it all up that still Jesus came to forgive us of all of it there's need for each of us to consider our own sin that before we look out we must allow the word of God to look into us that before we point the fingers towards others we must see where we ourselves are there are two paths to take one which repents and surrenders before the king of kings the other rebels and so we have to be careful because we might say that these are them the Israelites but we know how much our how much our hearts mimic how much our hearts are reflected in these Israelites this week we have to do a lot of self-reflection because it is when we remember a new a fresh that he came to save me from my sin that is the only way we are going to be able to go out into the world and properly deliver the good news of Jesus Christ there's no other way what are we going to say oh you wicked people he came to save you there's there's no way we can do that we come humble to the church for the believer have you forgotten him do you find yourself in a position of the people at the end saying who is this Jesus have you forgotten his abounding love do you remember him or have you forgotten if if we know him and remember him then we will eagerly await for him to come back longing for the kingdom not investing in a lot not longing in the things of this fading world our love will be for him and not for this world and so we will go out into the world and evangelize we will become the very body of Christ that shares this gospel message because why did Jesus come into the world for this and so why am I still in the world as the body of Christ for this because he does not desire for any to come to death but for all to come to repentance and so that's why church we live our lives we remember it again this week what he did but to wrap this up don't be mistaken he's going to completely fulfill the rest of what was written in Zechariah and psalm and all the prophecies of the conquering king Jesus is indeed coming he came to conquer sin but he is coming back to claim his people none of his promises are going to fail the fullness of the prophecies will come to pass one day when Jesus returns for his own in fact remember when we're in we're in Matthew 21 tonight today in just three chapters is to all of it discourse that's the one where he shows you what it's going to look like when he comes back and he says in Matthew 24 29 but immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken and then the sun the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and then all the tribes of the earth what does it say it says they will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory and he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other Jesus is going to come back like this you want to see how he's going to come back and this is how we'll conclude Revelation 19 let's look at Revelation 19 remember the first time he came in on a donkey but this is how he will return Revelation 19 11 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he who sat on it is called faithful and true and in righteousness he judges judges and wages war his eyes are a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems and he has a name written on him which no one knows except himself he is clothed with the robe dipped in blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which are in heaven clothed and fine linen white and clean were following him themselves on white horses from his mouth comes a sharp sword so that with it he may strike down the nations and he will rule them with the rod of iron and he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God the Almighty and on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written King of Kings and Lord of Lords when we go and evangelize we preach two things we we preach grace and we preach judgment right we go out and we tell everybody of the Jesus who came what he did what he's like how much he loves how he so desires but we also point forward and we plead with them kneel confess confess confess repent as he is coming back like this so in the triumphal entry so strange we see a conquering king but we see the humble king all right let's pray heavenly father would you help us to see our sin that the gospel of grace would be so fresh and beautiful again that this week we won't fast forward to the resurrection but we'll take but we'll take time to see all that our Christ did to purchase us thank you so much Lord for opening our eyes to this truth help us to see ourselves in the the sinner in the pages of Scripture that it might not be fresh just for a personal worship but unto your glory going out to the ends of the earth that you would be preached in our lives that we would be a proper reflection of what King Jesus actually is like thank you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen let us rise as we sing our closing praise thank you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen thank you Lord in Jesus
