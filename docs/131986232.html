also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=154s">00:02:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">represented in this conference.</span></div><div

came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=163s">00:02:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">up was pleading with the churches in Korea that before we enter into North Korea, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=169s">00:02:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to be a revival in the churches now, because if North Korea opens up, and all we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=174s">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doing

obviously the work of compassion is to reach out to the underprivileged children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=180s">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to feed them and care for them, but their ultimate goal is much more beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=185s">00:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's obviously to reach them with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and so what they're hoping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=189s">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is that they would prepare the churches in Korea that when, and if and when it opens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=195s">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">up, that the churches will be established in various places out of North Korea, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then that compassion will be able to work through the churches to reach out to the children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=205s">00:03:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I went to Philippines, I can honestly tell you that the work that they're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=209s">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is very effective, that they're not just feeding the children, they're actually establishing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=213s">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the local churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=224s">00:03:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's really transforming that whole area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=228s">00:03:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though it's in the name of the mercy ministry, the gospel is really penetrating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=232s">00:03:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into this area through their ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=234s">00:03:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what they're hoping to do in North

href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=252s">00:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to enter into North Korea and spread nominal Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=257s">00:04:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That we know how to do church, we know how to establish the organization of a church,</span></div><div

can run Sunday school in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=269s">00:04:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">church, but no power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=273s">00:04:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as the scripture says, to have a form of godliness, everything that physically looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=278s">00:04:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like a church, we know how to do

generation that has ever lived because of technology, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=286s">00:04:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of education, because of experience, and yet not knowing anything of its power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=294s">00:04:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can say, you know, I look at the Korean churches, because you know, just coming back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=300s">00:05:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from there, that the previous generation, you know, was known to be theologically chaotic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=307s">00:05:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, because it was established by missionaries, it was established by people who weren't properly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=313s">00:05:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">theologically trained, but they had passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=316s">00:05:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they sacrificed, they suffered, many of them were martyred, put into jail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=320s">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">during various periods of Christian

in, and there's more and more good teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=332s">00:05:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for whatever the reason, along with the good teaching, the passion, the sacrifice, is no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=338s">00:05:38.760</a></span> | <span

think that it describes the church situation well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=346s">00:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That they have a form of godliness, the form is spectacular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=350s">00:05:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They know how to do church, they know how to put in programs, you walk into a church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=354s">00:05:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and the welcome team, and song and dance, I mean, the church is run like a Fortune 500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=361s">00:06:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">company, I mean, everything is done so professionally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=365s">00:06:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the heart of the church, what really matters, the worship, is dry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=371s">00:06:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could see that there's no expectation of the people who are entering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=376s">00:06:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was really encouraging to me, and touching to me, when the pastors were pleading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=381s">00:06:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was, again, this was a conference of mostly pastors and leaders in the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=385s">00:06:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and one pastor in particular that I remember, he was pleading in tears with the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/131986232#t=390s">00:06:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saying,
