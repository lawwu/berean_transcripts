I'm a junior in the college ministry and this is my testimony. I was born in Korea and adopted into a Christ-loving family when I was around six months old. So as I look back, God's plan for my salvation started right off the bat, but I was blind and my heart was too hardened to realize it. I spent my whole life going to church, but the whole time I was just going through the motions. I was even baptized when I was in fifth grade, but I was way too young to realize what it truly meant. As I got older, I had all the head knowledge that someone who grew up in the church should have, but it wasn't for the right reasons. I knew all the right answers and what to say during discussions and Bible study, but of course the knowledge I gained was for my own self-righteousness so that I could look like a good Christian to others, but it wasn't for God's glory. I knew about all about God on the surface, but I didn't have a personal relationship with him. Because of this, I struggled with surrendering my life fully to Christ and giving up all I have to him. I would still go to church on Sundays and Bible studies on Fridays, but throughout the week, I took the mask off and lived as if there was no God. To me, Sundays and Fridays were times to see my friends, not a time to worship Christ. I lived very selfishly regarding my free time and I wouldn't ever do devotions or read the Bible on my own. Prayer was a rare thing in my life and I only really prayed when I felt like I needed it to. To me, God was like a genie in a bottle. My pride also got in the way as I felt like I needed to do something in order for me to be saved. I never doubted that God existed or thought the Bible was false, but I was much more interested in the empty promises of the world than giving my life to Christ. One of the biggest turning points in my life and one of the things I am most thankful for is when God led me to Berean. That's when I truly started to learn about who God really is and what that meant for me. Because of my pride, as I learned about the attributes of God, one of the things I struggled with the most was God's abundant mercy and grace. How could a perfect and holy God love a sinner like me? I always thought that I didn't deserve God's love and that there was no way I deserved to be saved. The funny thing was, I was absolutely correct. If God saves me, I have to do or give him something in return, I thought. Again, my pride wouldn't let me get over the fact that there was nothing I could do to help even a tiny bit with my salvation. It didn't happen overnight, but my mindset started to shift as I realized how broken I was and how much I needed God. In return, all I can give back is praise and gratitude. His love for me has inspired an overflow of worship and adoration as well as longing to learn more about Christ and his word. Experiencing God's love drove me to do daily things that I've never thought about doing before, such as spending time in his word and worshiping on my own time. I spent more time praying throughout the day as it felt more natural to go to God even when I wasn't in a dire situation. Doing these things no longer felt like something I had to do, but rather something I was lucky to be able to do, which filled me with joy. Over the summer, some of the college ministry did a Bible reading plan of the Old Testament. It was a fast-paced test of obedience, but it really helped me get a better grasp of who our God is. His incredible patience stuck out to me as I read about Israel sinning against God time and time again. The God of Israel is the same patient God that waited for me to surrender myself and let him in. It isn't from the Old Testament, but a verse I find really encouraging is 2 Peter 3.9. "The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness what is patient towards you, not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance." This verse really showed me God's goodness and that he will never give up on you, for he doesn't wish for anyone to be subject to his judgment in wrath. I've been rejecting God through my whole life, and he's been waiting for me to let go of the world and completely surrender to him. I've accepted that I'm completely undeserving of God's grace, but I rejoice now because I know God and I'm able to have a relationship with him. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
