class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=478s">00:07:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that from that moment on, the period is going to speed up, and then the intensity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=483s">00:08:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of the judgment is going to be intensified until the

angels have been described as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=741s">00:12:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">being mighty, and secondly, this is an angel that actually comes down from heaven, so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=745s">00:12:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is not his second coming, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=747s">00:12:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">His second coming of Christ is prophesied at a later time, so this is not like an in-between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=753s">00:12:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">coming and then he's going to come really later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=755s">00:12:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not Christ, but again, the description of this angel as a mighty angel, that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=761s">00:12:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so big, he's described two separate times where his feet touches the sea and the land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=766s">00:12:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, so if you remember the initial picture that I put up there, if you may, if you, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=771s">00:12:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to go all the way back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=778s">00:12:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you notice the size of the angel, again, that's how he's described for us in this passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=786s">00:13:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now again, who he is, we don't know.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=800s">00:13:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the last time we studied that there were two particular angels that have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=807s">00:13:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated presented to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=810s">00:13:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">One's name is Michael, and who is he?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=813s">00:13:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Archangel, and then who's the other one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=816s">00:13:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Gabriel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=817s">00:13:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Gabriel is often seen as the messenger, and he shows up in the book of Daniel too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=821s">00:13:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe this is Gabriel, we don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=823s">00:13:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just speculation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=824s">00:13:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, there's no ordinary angel, meaning that the message that he has to give to John,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=830s">00:13:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">John the apostle, was not just an ordinary message, that this is at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=836s">00:13:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=838s">00:13:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously he's holding in his hand a scroll that's already open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=841s">00:14:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this is a very important angel in God's kingdom, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=845s">00:14:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">He's described as having a rainbow on top of his head, and his leg or his feet with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=852s">00:14:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">fire, and his face was shining with the sun representing his glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=857s">00:14:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, typically when we talk about rainbow, in the Bible, it's talking about, reminds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=862s">00:14:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">us about the covenant relationship that God promised to the world, that he was not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=867s">00:14:27.940</a></span> | <span

his mercy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=873s">00:14:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically fire symbolizes judgment in the scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=878s">00:14:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So this angel, again, there's a promise of mercy, but also promise of judgment, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=882s">00:14:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be getting to in a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=888s">00:14:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The angel holds in his hands a little scroll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=892s">00:14:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not the same scroll that was opened with the seals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=895s">00:14:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a mini scroll that was part of the opening of the larger scroll, and he holds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=900s">00:15:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it in his hand, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=903s">00:15:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And unlike the scroll that is mentioned in chapter five, that was fastened with seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=909s">00:15:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">seals, this scroll is already open, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=912s">00:15:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, meaning that what the content of this scroll is already being played out in history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=921s">00:15:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=922s">00:15:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not bound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=924s">00:15:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's already being played out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=929s">00:15:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the significance, other than the fact that this angel is a gigantic angel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=935s">00:15:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is a powerful angel, the fact that he has one leg on the sea, one leg in the land, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=942s">00:15:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">signifies the universality of his message, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=945s">00:15:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The God's sovereignty over land and earth, and again, it visually shows that God is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=951s">00:15:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">sovereign, authoritative, powerful God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=955s">00:15:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So even in the description of this angel, it's described as God being powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=963s">00:16:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So John sees him, and then as soon as he sees him, he hears a loud voice, like a lion, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=968s">00:16:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">again, God's voice is described as a roaring of a lion in Amos chapter 3, 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=974s">00:16:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not God speaking, but it sounds like God, because this is a messenger of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=983s">00:16:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when he speaks, it kind of begins this chain reaction of the thunders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=988s">00:16:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The seven thunders begin to rumble, and they speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=992s">00:16:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And thunder, again, often in Scripture signifies retribution or judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1000s">00:16:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the angel appears, he sees the scroll, and then the angel begins to speak, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1005s">00:16:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of begins the – gets the ball rolling on this judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1011s">00:16:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever the idea of the thunder, the imagery of the thunder is mentioned, it's always equated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1016s">00:16:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">with God's judgment coming, at least in the book of Revelation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1020s">00:17:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">8.5, it follows with the casting of fire on the earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1023s">00:17:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 11.19 is associated with the seven trumpets and the plague.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1027s">00:17:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter 16.18 is connected with the final bowl of God's judgment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1034s">00:17:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, when the angel speaks, the judgment begins to start to come out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1039s">00:17:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1059s">00:17:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">told exactly what it is, right?</span></div><div

and he says, "Do not write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226031127#t=1070s">00:17:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it down."</span></div><div
