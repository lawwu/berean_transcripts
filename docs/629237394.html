I'm a junior in the college ministry and this is my testimony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=11">00:00:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I was born in Korea and adopted into a Christ-loving family when I was around six months old. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=16">00:00:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as I look back, God's plan for my salvation started right off the bat, but I was blind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=21">00:00:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and my heart was too hardened to realize it. I spent my whole life going to church, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=25">00:00:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole time I was just going through the motions. I was even baptized when I was in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=28">00:00:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">fifth grade, but I was way too young to realize what it truly meant. As I got older, I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=35">00:00:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all the head knowledge that someone who grew up in the church should have, but it wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=39">00:00:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for the right reasons. I knew all the right answers and what to say during discussions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=43">00:00:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and Bible study, but of course the knowledge I gained was for my own self-righteousness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=47">00:00:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so that I could look like a good Christian to others, but it wasn't for God's glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=52">00:00:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew about all about God on the surface, but I didn't have a personal relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=55">00:00:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with him. Because of this, I struggled with surrendering my life fully to Christ and giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=61">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">up all I have to him. I would still go to church on Sundays and Bible studies on Fridays,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=65">00:01:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but throughout the week, I took the mask off and lived as if there was no God. To me, Sundays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=70">00:01:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and Fridays were times to see my friends, not a time to worship Christ. I lived very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=75">00:01:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">selfishly regarding my free time and I wouldn't ever do devotions or read the Bible on my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=79">00:01:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">own. Prayer was a rare thing in my life and I only really prayed when I felt like I needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=84">00:01:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it to. To me, God was like a genie in a bottle. My pride also got in the way as I felt like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=89">00:01:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I needed to do something in order for me to be saved. I never doubted that God existed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=94">00:01:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or thought the Bible was false, but I was much more interested in the empty promises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=98">00:01:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the world than giving my life to Christ. One of the biggest turning points in my life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=103">00:01:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and one of the things I am most thankful for is when God led me to Berean. That's when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=107">00:01:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I truly started to learn about who God really is and what that meant for me. Because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=112">00:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">my pride, as I learned about the attributes of God, one of the things I struggled with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=116">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the most was God's abundant mercy and grace. How could a perfect and holy God love a sinner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=121">00:02:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like me? I always thought that I didn't deserve God's love and that there was no way I deserved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=126">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be saved. The funny thing was, I was absolutely correct. If God saves me, I have to do or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=132">00:02:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">give him something in return, I thought. Again, my pride wouldn't let me get over the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=136">00:02:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that there was nothing I could do to help even a tiny bit with my salvation. It didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=141">00:02:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happen overnight, but my mindset started to shift as I realized how broken I was and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/629237394&t=146">00:02:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">much I needed God.
