class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=121s">00:02:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed that in chapter 10, the "I am the door" and "I am the good shepherd" is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=125s">00:02:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">used interchangeably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=127s">00:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's hard to dissect, is he talking about the door, is he talking about the

chapter 9, what Jesus says about the door is really not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=142s">00:02:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to

us, feeds us, we understand that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=150s">00:02:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of it, or it's easier to

says that, the "I am the door"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=159s">00:02:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">statement, it really is just going

statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=176s">00:02:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is said right after this event.</span></div><div

and "I am the good shepherd," it'll be easier to follow and the text will be coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412712101#t=205s">00:03:25.520</a></span>
