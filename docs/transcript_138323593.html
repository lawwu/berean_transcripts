And we stopped doing that a while back because it was just getting too long. You know, so we had so many people and so many people praying, and so for the purpose of to be able to do all this in the same time, we stopped doing that. But nevertheless, that was a really important time to recognize all the people who have labored in their lives. And I know that each one of the people who are being baptized today, that many of you have encouraged them, shared with them. Some of you directly was able to share the gospel with them. And again, I can testify for myself with my children that there's a lot of people, even in this room, that share the gospel with my two boys who are being baptized today. And I remember even when they were little, little kids, you know, like in Sunday school, literally the Sunday school was them, and then a few of my nephews, and that was usually the Sunday school. And those of you who taught Sunday school at that time, you know, and I know that you guys share the gospel with them, and the youth group, youth teachers, and pastors who have been faithful in their lives. And so again, I'm very thankful that the room is filled with people who labor. Again, not only in my children's lives, but every single person that's here, that God uses the body of Christ in different ways. Sometimes you don't even know how you're being used. Sometimes you'll hear in their testimony how you welcome them into the church, and how that kind of opened the door for them to hear the gospel message. And it may mean nothing at that time, but how God uses different gifts and different people in their lives to be able to get them to this point where they're able to make a public profession. And so again, we want to thank all of you for laboring. And again, I hope that, and I know that their testimony will be a blessing to you. I wanted to just briefly share as a reminder about what the baptism is and what it is not. And then I'm going to give the rest of the time so that you can hear their testimonies. Baptism, in and of itself, has no power. So just because you're baptized or you're not baptized, it doesn't affect your salvation in any particular way. Because baptism, in and of itself, there's no power in those waters where you go in and you're washed, and you come out and all of a sudden you're clean. It's like marriage. Marriage ceremony, the ceremony itself is just what you do on the outside. But the ceremony in and of itself has no power. People get married on television all the time, but they're just playing. They don't make a movie and a show and they dress up and then they pretend like they get married and they say, "Oh, you're married now because you went through the ceremony." Ceremony is an outward expression of what is actually taking place inside. And so the real power behind what's happening is what God has been doing in their life. And so the baptism ceremony is just a public expression of what the power of the gospel has been doing in their lives, either at a point or through a series of time. So, what is baptism then? Baptism, the word in and of itself means to immerse. "Baptizo," it was not a uniquely Christian word. It was a word that was described in the Greek culture when somebody decided to convert. So, if somebody wanted to go into public office, they would have a baptism ceremony, meaning that they're going to put aside their private life in order to serve the country in a particular way. And so, the word itself means to be immersed in something, to change from one to another. And so the significance behind the baptism is, again, that each one of them, as they're being baptized, they're making a public profession that because of their union with Christ, their old life is being put away, and that they're, again, being united with Christ in His new life. Well, you might just say, "Well, if that's the case, if it's just a public ceremony, and the real power is already what's been taking place inside, what's the point of the ritual? Why is this so important?" Well, we know that in the Bible it's important because before Christ came He sent a messenger six months ahead of Him to prepare the way. Baptism was such an important part of His ministry that they actually called Him John the Baptist. That's just like some of you guys saying David the boba lover, or Eric the Jeremy Lin fan, or whatever it is that describes who you are. So, John the Baptist, His ministry was so, the baptism was such an integral part of His ministry that they actually called Him John the Baptist. And so, John the Baptist in His preaching, His primary preaching meaning was, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And so when people would come to Him saying, "I want to receive Christ," or "I want to be renewed," His teaching to them was, "Come and repent and be baptized." And baptism meaning to put away your old life and to receive Christ in repentance. So, the real meaning behind the baptism is this, is to repent. It's to repent of our sins, to be forgiven. And Romans chapter 6, 3-4 it says, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?" To be baptized into His death. So when they go into the water, I'm going to ask them the question, "Do you understand that when you go in you're uniting with Christ in His death? And when you come out you are uniting with Christ in His resurrection. But what does it mean to be baptized into His death?" As I said, the word "baptized" means to be immersed. So, literally, to be baptized means to be immersed, to be consumed along with His death. In Isaiah 53, 4-6, "Surely He has been born of our grief and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. Upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we all have turned, every one of us, our own way. The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." So to be united with Christ isn't simply that, "You know what, there's some sins that I need to get rid of, and so I'm going to come and I confess that sometimes I lie, sometimes I do this." Just as the word "baptism" means, it means to be completely consumed and immersed. There is no partial regeneration. There is no partial acceptance. To be immersed into His death means that every part of us, everything that we know of us is united with Him in His death. So we are consumed in His death. We're absolutely overpowered by His death. That's what that word means, to be baptized into His death. So that's why when we have our baptism, the person going into the water, the actual ritual is burial. That's what that water signifies. That when they go in, if they go in and a part of their head is sticking out of the water, we'll make sure that all of it is under the water. We'll make sure. Make sure that when that individual comes out, there's not a dry part of his body. There's not a single strand that hasn't been wet. Because that's the meaning of baptism, into His death, to be completely consumed and immersed. And that's why a Christian is described in 2 Corinthians 5.17, if anyone is in Christ, He is a new creation. Completely new. You're not a better version of the old. You're not, you know, Jeremy 2.0 or 2.6 or 5S or 6.6S or whatever, right? You're a completely new creation. He says the old has passed away, completely gone. Behold, the new has come. And that's what the baptism signifies. That we are surrendering our life to Christ and He gives us a completely new life. We put on the new, newness of Christ. But not only are we consumed in His death, the Bible says we are also united with Him in His death, in order that we may be united with Him in His resurrection. It's not just about the death. It's about the new life, to be reborn. In 1 Corinthians 15.54, it says death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is your victory? Oh death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin. The power of sin is in the law. When the individual comes out of the water, it signifies the same resurrection of Christ. That as He was resurrected, and that same power that resurrected Him will resurrect up because our sins were consumed in His death. When a Christian dies, you know, there's no individual who actually looks forward to death, the physical aspect of it. But every Christian who has been born again, has been united with Christ in His resurrection, it is in death, physical death that we will really live. That we will put away this fleshy body that keeps us away from being with the Lord. And so, when a Christian passes from this life, this physical life to the next, it says that we will be united with Christ permanently and eternally. So, I remember when my father was passing away, you know, I've been as a pastor I've been in the bedside of individuals who were passing away. I've attended many funerals. But I remember my father as he was passing away, it wasn't sudden, it took a long time. And I remember that process that the longer my father, or the more that my father knew that the time was coming, the more he seemed like he was looking forward to it. So, he lived his life laboring as a pastor, and gone through the ups and downs of life of being a servant of Jesus Christ. And I remember at the end of his life, he was leaving in peace because he wasn't going into eternity that was mysterious. You know, obviously it would be first for him, but he looked like he was eagerly anticipating, it's time for me to go and I need to go. And so, when he passed, of course it was sad for us that we were going to physically miss him. But there's also a joy that's in us because we know that he's with our Savior. So, in the resurrection, not only is this the resurrection of our physical flesh, but it reminds us of the hope that every single one of us has. That death has been consumed in victory in Jesus Christ. And that's what this baptism ceremony really is. That every single person who has this hope in Jesus Christ, because of our sins being washed away, there is no barrier between us and God. And therefore, when we die, we will be in his presence. And we can literally enter the throne of grace with confidence. And so, we encourage all of you, again, as Christians, as we hear their testimony, it's a reminder to us that this is why we worship God. This is why we surrender and give our life to him. For those of you who are here as our guests, again, we want to encourage you that, again, whether you believe this or not, this is at the essence of what Christianity is. That Christians are supposed to be nice, they're supposed to take care of the poor, and all of these things are things that the Scripture teaches us. But at the core of Christianity, why Jesus came, he says he has come to set the captives free. To set us free from our sins. And to forgive our sins. And he made an invitation years ago, that if you confess your sins, that he will be faithful and just. And he is compassionate and loving. That he will forgive you of your sins. As long as we acknowledge that we are sinners, as long as we acknowledge that he is the answer to our sins, he says he will forgive us. So, again, if you are here as a guest, hearing the Gospel for the first time, we encourage you that maybe at this moment you are not a believer. Maybe you are just kind of, is he? Is he real? Is he not real? Well, the best way to find out is ask him. You don't need to come to a ritual. There is no special ceremony that you need to be a part of. If God is real, just close your eyes and say, "God, if you are real, would you open my eyes and allow me to see if this is real or not?" And again, we want to encourage you, if you have any questions, we are more than willing to stay and answer questions. You can email us and we will try to do that. But again, for all of us, we ask that as you pay attention to the testimony, don't just listen to it like, "Oh, that's great. That's happening to them." Every single thing that they say, every Christian should be able to relate to. And I pray that as you are listening, that you may be encouraged and to be reminded again of the grace that all of us are under. So, at this time, we are going to begin with our brother, Mark. And he is going to come and give his testimony. Let's welcome him.  So, I'm Mark Van Riper. I'm the child of a Protestant father and a Jewish mother who decided that it would be best to raise me in the Presbyterian Church, where I was baptized early in my elementary education. It was not much later after that that I began to grow a dislike for the Church and for Christians in general. This was due to a combination of bad experiences with Sunday school teachers, my own thin-skinned nature, and my own feelings that I never really fit in. So, slowly I began with my withdrawal from the Church. And during this hiatus, I never really lost my faith in God. Well, I don't know if I really had one, but my understanding of Him was more akin to Santa Claus. So, up through my high school education, it was basically, I just tried not to do bad things so that God wouldn't punish me. During the fall of my sophomore year in high school, I tore my ACL in my knee, which required me to have surgery and effectively ended my hopes of any athletic greatness that every high school kid dreams of. During my recovery from the surgery, I began to feel more out of place and withdrawn than I usually experienced. So, this magnified my inner monologue that I, again, did not fit in or belong. So, I began to spend a great deal of time contemplating my life and my belief system. During a particularly deep period of depression, I remember stepping outside of my room on the second floor of the house and looking down at my father who was in the living room. While I was dealing with my own personal problems, my father was dealing with unemployment and an upcoming eviction from our home. As I looked down the stairs at my father while he was doing his daily devotionals, a feeling of peace came upon the house that was palpable. And it was this moment that I saw the peace that my dad had experienced in this. And I then knew what I wanted and what I needed in my life. I began attending church more often with the juvenile understanding that true worship of Christ involved self-deprecation and groveling in shame before him. Shortly after my return to church, I began to get involved with the youth ministry at my mother's strong urging. And it was there I met a youth pastor named Bill who was a young seminary student at the time. He encouraged me to dive into the scriptures and grow my knowledge of God through that. And so I began reading the scriptures and reading the writings of C.S. Lewis with a hunger that seemed to grow with each verse and each line I read. It was in this time of growth that I began to understand that Christ was a gracious God who is worshipped through love, compassion, and self-sacrifice. That he did not come to die on the cross to give me guilt, but to free me from it. This new God I had never known or seemed to understand. It was so unbelievable to me that all I wanted was to know Christ more. And with this knowledge I was able to find peace with my feelings of exclusion, understanding that I was an alien of this world and that my citizenship lies in heaven. This understanding released me from the anger that I felt from always being an outcast because I knew I belonged to an eternal family that would always accept me. And with this foundation I've been able to grow in my understanding of Christ even more and find that peace, understanding that all trials I face are not punishment, but like iron through a forge, they are an opportunity to be purified and strengthened in Christ. So I continue to seek to know Christ and the power of his resurrection, that I may help others to find the peace that transcends all understanding and help them to see the Savior who gives me the peace and wisdom in abundance. So, thank you.  Mark, do you understand when you go into the water you're uniting with Christ in his death and when you come out you're uniting with Christ in his resurrection? Yes, sir. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  My name's Liana. I'm currently an upcoming fourth-year at UCI. I grew up in the church, but I was normally the kid who went with the flow and didn't really understand what I was learning and didn't really see the importance of it. I would go to church usually intending to play with my friends and pass time. Also growing up I had a different mindset than other kids my age. By blood, my dad was my dad, but relationally I considered my grandpa like a dad. After my parents suffered a miscarriage, I was cast aside to my grandparents at age three to raise me while they coped by busying themselves with work. Because of that, I hadn't seen my parents often when I was younger. My grandfather was a firm believer, and I witnessed to the strength of his faith daily through his diligence in reading the Bible and praying every chance he had. My church experienced a split, and suddenly I found myself being forced to leave my friends and attend another church. In my head, I thought, "Great, I have to find new friends," while my parents no longer felt obligated to go to church. Still, my grandpa persistently attended without complaint, even going as far as taking the bus by himself when there was no one to give him a ride. By the time I was in middle school, my grandpa had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, which resulted in him receiving surgery. Despite my fears, things seemingly went back to normal until he had recovered from his surgery. It wasn't until four years later that we found out that his cancer had come back and spread to bone marrow cancer. He was being treated at home with nurses coming in and out of my house, and his lack of strength had prevented him from physically attending church, but it did not hinder his faith, as he still spent a majority of his time praying and reading the Bible. At the time, I would have to come straight home after school to take care of my grandpa while my parents worked and my sisters were at school. It wasn't until one day when I was handling his IV that he told me about how his faith changed his life. From then, I was convicted to take Christianity seriously, but what I didn't realize was that it was also conditioning me. I had believed that as long as I paid attention in church, I would keep my grandpa's pain away, allowing him to stay alive. I was 18 years old at that time. In the beginning of my freshman year of college, I hit the lowest point in my darkest time that I ever had in my very short life. Certain circumstances have left me dangerously unhappy and only got worse. On October 26, 2012, I had found out that my grandpa had passed away. The day before my grandpa had passed, I had selfishly chosen to stay in Irvine rather than go home so I could hang out with my friends. It wasn't until later that I found out my grandpa had been asking for me. I felt hurt and angry, especially towards God, and I blamed myself. I had prayed every day for healing, only to feel like my grandpa was taken away from me without giving me a chance to say goodbye. I thought that even my grandpa, the biggest believer I knew, was robbed of his last moments. My hurt and anger fixed towards the belief that I had in Christ and hardened my heart until I refused to have anything to do regarding the church or my superficial faith. My anger continued on for a year and a half, and I led myself down a destructive and dark path to the point where I felt lost and lonely no matter where I was. I surrounded myself with friends, thinking I could fill the emptiness I had inside of me. My grades slipped, my social life took a dive, and my relationship with my family was hanging on by a thread. This cycle stopped when a close friend introduced me to a campus ministry called CCM. At first, I had gone for social intentions, but ended up inevitably listening to the messages. I remember standing for midterms when my thoughts unexpectedly recalled the messages that I had heard. Suddenly, I broke down in tears as my heart opened up and I realized that God hadn't taken my grandpa away from me, but showed his mercy and grace by taking his pain away instead. It was then that I realized that my grandpa had spent his entire life trusting God until the end of his days while I opened my eyes to the fact that God had a plan for me. I prayed that I would find joy in things and I appreciate what I had rather than focus on what I had lost. I prayed that I would find my way. I also felt guilt for the built-up anger that I had for a year and a half and for the sins that I had committed during that time. Above all, I had pleaded that God would forgive me for my foolishness, selfishness, and sinful heart. The burdens of my sins were heavy on my conscience, paired with the regret of my actions, and I was desperate for a second chance. I wanted to make myself a new person, as told in Colossians 3, and prove myself different. After opening up my heart and after a few months of attending Berean, I had accepted Christ and my lifestyle had changed completely. My priorities were different. I prayed genuine prayers. I consistently did my devils for the first time and I made the choice to become a member. Also, whereas previously I would have seen it as unnecessary, now I'm taking the next step in my growth and getting baptized. I still feel sad and occasionally scared that my grandpa is physically absent, but the words of Isaiah 41.10 calmed my fears and anxiety and gave me strength to pursue a life with Christ. While I was previously walking lost in the dark, I am now walking in Christ. Thank you.    You understand you're going into the water, you're united with Christ in His death. When you're coming out, you're united with Christ in His resurrected life. And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.      Hi. I'm Jeremy and this is my testimony. I know probably most of you guys know that I pretty much grew up here. I was born into this church. Sorry, I'm nervous. But yeah, I went to this church my whole life. I grew up in the church. I learned all the stories. I learned the Bible pretty well just going to church every Sunday, my parents being devout Christians. But I don't think I ever really thought about or comprehended what I actually believed in probably until like my, until seventh grade. In seventh grade we moved to a different house and instead of going to a different school we decided that we would try to, one year of homeschooling. So my seventh grade year we were homeschooled and it sucked.  I really hated it. I got pulled out of school. I was away from all my friends and I was at home alone all the time. I had no social life. This is around the time where I started puberty. Emotionally I was very all over the place and I think I got pretty rebellious against my parents. So yeah, I just had a lot of emotional stress during that time. I ended up spending a lot of time in my room just feeling really lonely and bitter. I guess that gave me a lot of time to just reflect upon my life. I guess that's when I really started to question what I believed in. After all those years of hearing the gospel just like so many times I think it finally started to make sense to me during that time. I was finally able to just think about what the gospel meant to me and I was able to accept that. I finally understood and was able to realize that I'm a sinner and that I deserve to be judged by God but God showed mercy upon me and he gave me the opportunity to receive salvation. So I mean, yeah, during that time I was able to accept Christ. I don't know exactly when I did but it was in that time, my seventh grade year. So I gave my life to Christ. I repented and I truly believe that God forgave me of my sins and that I have hope in a future, in a place in heaven. Since then there's been a lot of times, there's been a lot of dry patches, times where I've felt really distant from God but I look back at all the times that I've drifted away from God and God's always brought me back to him. I have complete faith that God was with me in all those times and that's such a good reminder to me that God will be with me in the future. I know things are just going to get harder. There will be a lot more harder obstacles in my way in the future but I know and I have complete trust that God will take care of me and yeah, that's my testimony.      And I understand when you go into the water that you're united with Christ in his death and when you come out you're united with Christ.    (audience applause and cheers) (audience applause and cheers) (audience applause and cheers) - My name is Annette Revelo. I'm a fourth year at UCI. In the earlier years of my life, I grew up in the Seventh-day Adventist church. I liked it, but I was too young to truly understand what it meant to follow Christ. I came because family took my sister and I, and I'm grateful for my aunt, my dad, and everyone else that took me to church practically every Saturday morning. I won't forget those early morning biscuits my aunt would make, the omelet, the soy milk, which were, let's face it, my primary motivators to attend Sabbath school every morning. As I grew older, I felt distant from God, although I knew this in the back of my mind. I was always motivated by someone else to see God, whether it be family, friends. It wasn't something that came to me as something truly important. Being inspired by my cousin as she took me to young adult Bible studies right after I graduated high school, a part of me wanted to get closer to God during my college years. Therefore, right when I started college, I tried to find a church of fellowship. In addition, I started my job as a freshman. In short, I put a lot on my plate and didn't even let myself properly transition to college. I felt overwhelmed, and sadly to me, the main purpose of fellowship was to make friends and not seek God. Although I came to church, it was not consistent, and it didn't come out out of love for God, but to have the feeling of doing the right thing. I also tried to read the Bible, but not in a way that was in depth. You would think I was doing the right thing, but I'm making progress with my faith because I was at least trying, but it was the opposite. I progressed backwards, falling into sin by not valuing my time with God and compromising my purity. The sin drew me away from God, from church, from friends. Although I would try and come to church, the gospel would not reach me deeply, and I would feel discouraged to come back the next week. Then, two weeks later, two years later, God broke me. He made me realize how true his words are by how fallen our society has become and will continue to be. I was just spiritually awakened by the signs of the times, but this awakening left me scared, left me doubting my salvation. I believed in Christ, but did I live the life of a believer? This not only left me scared for myself, but my family. Therefore, I also tried to warn them from what I thought came out of love, but what I didn't realize was that it was out of fear. I knew it was not enough to believe. I knew that I couldn't face this myself, and I needed the help of a church to build up my faith. I re-listened to one of Pastor Peter's sermons online called To Be a Man After God's Own Heart. I felt convicted after and realized that I had been a fan of Jesus, had I been a fan of Jesus all my life. I knew that Jesus Christ was the only way to salvation, but did I truly know what that meant? Surely enough, God is faithful, God's timing is always right. Before returning to church on Sunday, I sought to talk to a pastor for the convictions I felt. Therefore, I tried to attend Berrien's College Bible Study one Friday night. Praise the Lord, because a new Bible study session was just starting for the summer that same week. I knew I had to repent, but how did I know if I was saved? I asked Pastor Mark this, and he asked me a very simple question, did I reconcile with God? He broke it down for me that same night, and when I came home, I kneeled and prayed for forgiveness of my sins and accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and saver. I felt broken inside and so small like a child and desperately wanted him. It was an amazing feeling. When I felt all the sin, confusion, doubt, and fear, I knew there was no better way to meet Christ than reading the gospel. For the first time, I came to understand what it meant to live a life of faith, because Christ did it himself. For the first time, I understood the importance of loving our neighbors, how powerful our God is, and I understood that we must slowly die to ourselves. Last, I came to really understand and truly appreciate the love Jesus Christ had for us when he died on the cross to pay for all our sins by reading the gospel and taking BCC. God really took all my anxiety and my doubt and has made me really depend on him through his word. I really hope and pray that I won't drift away, but by becoming baptized and one with Christ, I want to proclaim this love that grows more and more as I seek him by becoming one with my Lord and saver. In this, I hope to really turn away from my old life but live a life new, a new focus more on pursuing to glorify God. (audience applauding) (water trickling) - Dianette, do you understand that you're going to the water to be united with Christ in his death and then to return and come out and be united with Christ in his life of resurrection? And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (water trickling) (audience applauding) - Hello, my name's Zach Kim, and I am gonna be sharing with you guys my testimony today. So I grew up in the church my whole life as my dad being the pastor, and I never really took my faith seriously until we had a youth group retreat in the eighth grade. I don't remember most of the things that, I don't remember a lot of the things that we learned there, but one thing that I do remember is (audience laughing) the story of the prodigal son. I've heard the story dozens of times and I never really understood how beautiful this story really was. And one of the pastors that was explaining it at the retreat just explained it in depth and helped me understand that we're all the prodigal son having turned away from our father and how sad God is to see us heading down the wrong path. But the pastor explained how in the story the father was looking for his son to return home every moment, and how when he saw his son running, or when he saw his son, he ran to him, embracing him, and welcoming him with open arms. And then everyone rejoiced and had a party because the son was once lost and was now found. As I heard this true meaning of the story, I realized how broken and sorrowful God was to see me heading down, having my back turned towards him. Treating him the least of my priorities, denying him daily through my life, at school, home, or wherever I went, God still showing his love and compassion towards me. And at the moment I was so broken, having my eyes open, seeing God for who he truly was, I repented truly for the first time at that retreat, truly meaning my repentance and wanting God to be my savior. So after that retreat, I came back down from the mountains and slowly I started to go back to my old way of living, by cursing at school, cheating, stealing, and so on. I would repent over and over, and I thought to myself, forgetting how great God's love is. And God can't love me anymore, and I thought to myself that God couldn't love me anymore 'cause I continued to sin over and over again. But I realized just how sinful we really are, and that the grace of God and compassion for us is so much greater than anything we can ever imagine. So acknowledging that, being a Christian means that when we sin, we repent of it to God, acknowledging that we can't do anything on our own, and fully relying on him, and that there's no other way to eternal life than through him. And again and again, through different times in my life, I realized how great God's love is. One thing that just broke me when I realized how much my parents had showed their love for me, after getting suspended almost twice from school, I realized that day my dad, he forgave me before I even asked for forgiveness. And one time how... One time how I cursed about my mom to one of my friends, how she forgave me before I asked for forgiveness. I couldn't understand how much, how they could love me unconditionally. And I thought about how God's love is just infinitely much greater than anyone you can ever imagine, anyone in your life, and that he sent his only sign for us to die for our sins so that we could have a chance to be with him in heaven. Before I knew Christ, I was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind and now I can see. I was once without purpose, but now my purpose is to glorify God in all aspects of my life. And when I fail, I will continue to get back up knowing that there is something much greater for me and you and for everyone who believes in Christ Jesus, our Lord, which is eternal life with him. Thank you.
