heard about the two goats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=753s">00:12:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But it wasn't just the two

sacrificed and one being released,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=763s">00:12:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">there had to be preparation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=766s">00:12:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So Aaron needed to be, his sins needed to be atoned for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=770s">00:12:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the blood of the goat and the bull needed to cleanse the tabernacle itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=776s">00:12:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So even before they get to this sacrifice, there needed to be cleansing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=782s">00:13:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Cleansing of the man handling all of

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=796s">00:13:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But here, everything that they handled needed to be absolutely crystal clean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=802s">00:13:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And even the sacrifices of these two goats needed to be done in a place where thorough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=806s">00:13:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">cleaning already took place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=811s">00:13:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The bull is to be offered for the sin offering for Aaron

himself needed to be atoned for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=820s">00:13:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">his own sins in order for him to even handle the offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=825s">00:13:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">He used to take the censer full of coals of fire from the altar, two handfuls of sweets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=828s">00:13:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and incense, this

to take the ashes from the altar outside and bring that in and begin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=841s">00:14:01.980</a></span> | <span

done to cover the mercy seat as a testimony to Aaron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=850s">00:14:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this was so that when Aaron entered in, that he would not die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=856s">00:14:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And over and over again, as I mentioned, he says, this is being done so that Aaron would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=861s">00:14:21.860</a></span>

captures the thought behind the Hebrew word for atonement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=892s">00:14:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">kippur, which means to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=897s">00:14:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So the word for atonement in Hebrew is kippur and the word literally means to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=902s">00:15:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice, if you read chapter 16, it says that the tabernacle needed to be atoned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=908s">00:15:08.940</a></span> | <span

about sin, like a human sin and God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=914s">00:15:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">comes and he takes away their sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=916s">00:15:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But the word literally just means to cover, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=921s">00:15:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is interesting because in the Old Testament, the idea of atonement was simply to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=926s">00:15:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So something was filthy, so blood came and covered it to protect it from God's glory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=932s">00:15:32.580</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=950s">00:15:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Doesn't that give us insight of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant?</span></div><div class="c"><span

temporarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=960s">00:16:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and they didn't have any power to actually atone for sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=963s">00:16:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The New Testament idea of atonement was actually

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=969s">00:16:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the very word for the word atonement, because when you read chapter 16, I'm hoping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/273529974#t=974s">00:16:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that you ask that question, how or why is a tabernacle need
