href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=120s">00:02:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you remember, the whole book of Hebrews is written to a group of people who have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=125s">00:02:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">drifting from their faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=127s">00:02:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've been tempted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=129s">00:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In the very beginning of their faith, they were celebrating their love for Christ and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=134s">00:02:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they were fellowshipping with those who were being imprisoned, and so it was a very strong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=140s">00:02:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">church, but at some point, maybe after 10, 20, 30 years, the persecution was intensified,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=147s">00:02:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and so many of them started drifting back to their old life, to the Judaistic life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=152s">00:02:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the

class="t">So we had chapter 10, 10 chapters of talking about how Jesus Christ is better than everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=163s">00:02:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that they value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=169s">00:02:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what he's been talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=171s">00:02:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been laying out Christology to demonstrate to them that this great salvation that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=176s">00:02:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have in Christ, that if we neglect such a great salvation, how much more deserving of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=181s">00:03:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment would we have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=183s">00:03:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had 11 chapters of, or 10 chapters of Christology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=188s">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we get to chapter 12 and chapter 13, it's the application of those 10 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=193s">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">If we truly believe that Christ is supreme over everything else, then this is how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=201s">00:03:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ought to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=202s">00:03:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 12 and chapter 13, there's a lot of imperatives teaching us instructions on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=206s">00:03:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what we ought to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=208s">00:03:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 11 is right in the middle where he's transitioning from the indicatives to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=212s">00:03:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">imperatives, where he's teaching us this is who Jesus is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=217s">00:03:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if he truly is supreme over everything that we value, then we ought to live this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=222s">00:03:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=223s">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so chapter 11 is, he's saying, but that gap is because of faith, by faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=229s">00:03:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we've been talking about in chapter 11, that if you believe this, chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=233s">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 10, then you will do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=236s">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's some examples of some people who by faith have done this, by faith have done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=240s">00:04:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=241s">00:04:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's important for us to recognize that I think every one of us have a tendency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=248s">00:04:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of us are more prone to action, and so we don't have a lot of patience for the theological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=254s">00:04:14.160</a></span> | <span

tell me what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=258s">00:04:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to get to work.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=261s">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we kind of leave our theology at a kind of superficial or at a basic level, and then</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/521269920#t=278s">00:04:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when it comes to the application, we don't pay as much attention to that.</span></div><div
