If I can get your attention. If you guys are outside and you hear me, can you guys come in now? Okay, before we get started, we've already talked about how this got started. I mean, I think our sisters ministry, I forgot what the exact date is. Let me give a plug right now. It's in October 8th. And when did the Dropbox movie come out? 2015. So it's been maybe about seven years. So I know some of you guys watched it, and I know our family watched it with the Lee family when it came out a while back. And so how many of you guys have actually seen that documentary? Okay, so a lot of you. Okay, and so that documentary has been--has came out, and it wasn't just local. I mean, it was international. People saw it, and God is really using this ministry to affect the pro-life ministry all over the world. And, you know, I don't have time to get into it. Maybe they'll get into it a little bit. You know, during the time that we had lunch, we were talking together, and they were kind of sharing with us a little bit about the international ministry. In fact, Pastor Lee is traveling all over the United States, and they're getting rewards and awards for the ministry that they're doing. But, again, as he is promoting, obviously, his ministry, there is a ministry to basically for pro-life, anti-abortion ministry, and he's able to meet with dignitaries and governors and, you know, attorney generals. And, again, there's a lot of things that they're directly involved with that I had no idea. Obviously, we know about the Baby Box ministry. So hopefully we'll have some time to maybe, you know, poke around in that. We've already received some questions, but I'm not sure how we're going to do this. If you have questions, if you can text that to Pastor Mark or Pastor Nate, somebody who's better with technology. Okay. Can you give me your number? Okay. So I'm going to have Pastor Mark get the text, and then he'll filter it out and maybe send the ones that maybe we might ask later to text me. And we already have some questions that we've already forwarded, but maybe if there are some other questions that may come up through the presentation, we'll try to field a few of those. Okay. So our Sisters Ministry is watching this. So if you haven't signed up for that and you haven't watched it, and even if you did watch it, I think it's a great opportunity to fellowship together. And, again, Pastor Lee and his associate pastor is here, so it would be a great opportunity for us to get to know that a little bit better. Okay. And it's just, you know, when we announced that, the Lee family, Esther and Lee, you know, when they heard that we're going to be watching that movie, they said, "Hey, Pastor Lee is going to actually come into town on this date." You know, so last minute, it's like, "Oh, it would be great." You know, it's like God's providence that they're able to be here and join us. And so while they're here, let's milk it. You know what I mean? So, yeah, let's ask them questions so we can benefit from this. And that's why we put this together kind of last minute. So I want to thank you for coming. So the schedule of this afternoon is going to be this way. So I'm going to pray for us, and then afterwards, Pastor Lee, who is the interpreter, he's the associate pastor of the church that Pastor Lee -- Pastor Lee, they're both Pastor Lees. So, huh? Yeah, so two pastors, Pastor Lee 1, Pastor Lee 2. So Pastor Lee 2 is going to come up, and he's going to present the ministry. So I think before we do that, we're going to watch the video first, right? Yeah. So I'm going to pray for us. We're going to watch a short presentation on the video. And then after the video, Pastor Lee, number 2, is going to come up. And then, huh? Pastor Jimmy. Okay, that's easy. Okay, so Pastor Jimmy is going to come up, and he's going to be presenting the ministry, obviously because he's the interpreter, so he's going to tell us in English what's going on in the ministry and some of the background information and testimony and how it got started. So he'll come up and give that presentation. Then after that, Pastor Lee and Jimmy will come up. Pastor Jimmy will come up, and then I'll ask them the question. I'm going to be asking in English so that they can interpret and then present it to you, and then they'll interpret for us. Okay? So that's the schedule for today. Again, as the presentation goes on, if you happen to have a question, text Pastor Mark. Okay? Where's Pastor Mark?  Okay.  Okay, it's on the Facebook group. I know a lot of -- not everybody has a Facebook group. Yeah. 949-231-8323. 949-231-8323. Okay. All right. So if you happen to have a question -- we're not going to be able to answer all those questions, but if there's a pertinent question that comes in after the presentation, we'll try it. Okay? Then Pastor Mark will forward it to me. So everybody just come on. Find a seat somewhere. There's plenty of seat to the right. So come, have a seat. Let me pray for us and then we'll begin with watching a movie. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to serve you, to gather together, to worship you, and especially, Lord God, the ministry that you are doing with Pastor Lee and the ministry, Lord, of compassion, of really honoring life as you love us. I pray, Father God, that you would bring blessing upon blessing, Lord, that more and more people will know not just the preciousness of these children, but how precious life is to you, and that your glory, your gospel may spread through this channel. I pray, Father God, that this afternoon as we interview and listen to the presentation, Lord God, that this would not simply be tickling of the ear, just a tug of heart, but that it really would cause us, Lord God, to serve you, to honor you, to put into action the things that you convict us. So I pray for your spirit's guidance. May this time be a blessing, challenge, and encouragement. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some people have a question about that. Korea is a kind of developed country already. Then, yeah, right. Economically, Korea is one of the developed countries. Then, if someone register the newborn baby in the family record, there is no problem. In many cases, no problem. The social welfare works, is working for them. Then, there are some cases, some people who are located in the shadow of our society. The authority and public part, public government authority have no intention and have no interest in the weak, in the poor. So, there are kind of a gap, kind of a shadow of the low system and public work or social welfare system. There is four cases cannot register. It is related to the cultural background of Asian. I think most of all, all of all can understand about that, the value of a family, a bloodline and blood time. That is the highest value. So, in Korea, the case of Korea, we should register a newborn baby in the family record. So, some single mothers, unwed, some single mothers cannot make the registration. Some people, why cannot do that? Then, they cannot do that because the matter of family. So, some people cannot register. Then, there is the second, is there any second option? No, there is no option. If you cannot register on the family record, there is nothing to do. That is the dead end path. So, baby is the only replacement. Some people blame the unwed single mothers. You choose the abandonment of your baby. How can you do that? So cute and adorable baby, then how can you do that? You are so bad people. You are so bad woman. Then, they cannot anything. They cannot choose nothing. There is no option. They cannot choose anything. So, they cannot but come to baby box. Foreign laborers, illegal foreign laborers, and rape case, sexual abuse, and extra marriage, those cases cannot make registration. So, for that cases, Korea baby box works for. And some people ask him, "Why do you do that? Why do you want to do that?" He said, "How can I cannot do that? How can I not kind of, yeah, I cannot but do this." Thank you. (speaking in Korean) (laughter) You know, Pastor Lee actually has never come to the United States. This is the first time visiting the United States. Yeah. So, considering his English is very good. (applause) Try to speak a language that you've never even visited, just practicing here. That's very good. So, this next question is concerned with, you know, I was talking to them in private and I learned something about the Korean law. You know, the Korean law about abortion has been going back and forth. And so, there's been a lot of politicians who's been pushing against abortion. And so, two years ago, there was a legislation that passed where they made abortion illegal in Korea. But the problem is, there's obviously, there's doctors and different organizations who are pushing to keep it legal. So, there's a confusion in the Korean law where even though on the books it's illegal, they said that there's no description in the law how to punish the people who practice abortion. So, even though it's illegal, if you practice it, there's no way to punish them. There's no law saying that here's the penalty, you're going to go to jail or nothing like that. And so, they basically, in complaint, they sent it up to the legislation and it's been sitting there for the last two years with no movement at all. So, basically, it's kind of a political movement where they're appeasing the pro-life movement by saying that we made it illegal and they're also appeasing the abortion movement by keeping it there and not moving it. So, they're kind of stuck. So, basically, in practical, legally, it's illegal. But for practical reasons, it's legal because there's no punishment that comes with it. So, people are pushing to try to get this legislation passed. So, along with that, the next question is, what kind of ministries and activities are there connected to the pro-life movement in Korea and the United States and other countries? (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) (Korean translation) He's saying the point is the perspective and the worldview. So many people despise the value of life. Some people think about they have a right to choose to live or to die about the existence or decision about the baby in the womb of the mother. Then he said every single life is valuable because God loves us so much. He sent us his only begotten son to save us. So, we are beloved people by God. So, every single of us, every single person is so valuable, as valuable as the blood of Jesus Christ. So, we have a kind of possibility and value to live on earth equally. So, he said, the point of his saying is the worldview is very important, the perspective is very important. Under the grace of the Lord, we should grab on hard and firmly the value of life. So, I will fight for against and fight for pro-life movement and fight against despising the value of life. The smallest of all living things on earth is the life of the mother. The life in the womb. And among the living things in the womb, the children with disabilities are just being abandoned. In the U.S. and Korea, they are being abandoned. But God is not like that. God said, "I am the little one who was born with disabilities." So, when we kill and save people, if we value our own life, we value the lives of others. We can enjoy our own lives. This is challenging God. Who is the weakest person on the earth? I think the baby in the womb is the weakest. So, he cannot do nothing to protect himself or herself. Then, among the smallest and weakest ones, the disabled is weaker than others. Then, he said, "The disabled baby is very precious." God said like this. Jesus said like this. "The smallest one is me." So, everyone is very valuable and everyone has great possibility to live on the earth. So, I think the perspective and worldview is very important. A child named Eumman was paralyzed. He could not do anything. But God wrote the Bible. We humans can't do anything because we are lying in bed. We can't do anything. But God in the child. God in the child. I saw the Lord in the child. I saw the Lord in the child. The Lord wrote the Bible. Through the son Eumman, the father became a pastor. Through the son Eumman, the Lord's love embraced the little ones. Through the paralyzed child, Kyle, the Lord protected and protected the little ones and sent them back to their home. So, we should not boast of being good, smart, capable, and capable. When we boast of our weakness and give everything to the Lord, the Lord will forgive the weak and God will write the one who loves the Lord and the one who has faith. I saw God's writing through my faith and I saw it through my life. My biological son Eumman, he was laid on the bed all his life. He could not move his finger even. Then he was a minister to teach me. He was a minister to open up the Jusaran Community Church Ministry. So, don't judge others who can do something. He's somebody, he's nobody. That judgment would be not possible because the weakness I saw the Lord in the weak people. Even my biological son, I met the Lord in him. So, God can do his work. God walks his walk through the weak. He can do that. So, don't judge others and don't judge the disabled and don't judge others' personality or else. - Yeah, I mean, the fact that this whole ministry came out of the suffering of their home where he was taking care of a bedridden son and for 14 years he was bedridden. And imagine, you know, I mean, now, obviously, he's getting worldwide attention and this ministry has become huge, but it all came from decades of suffering in that home, of taking care of their child and how God has used that and had a plan to use all of that to do what he's doing now. They didn't answer directly, but when I was talking to them privately, this ministry, again, out of compassion and out of obedience, what he started, has triggered a worldwide movement like a pro-life movement, even indirectly. I don't think that was his goal, but just being compassionate for these children and so that movie has been seen worldwide and he showed me a picture while we were having lunch. He took a picture with the attorney general of Mississippi and if you've been following what's going on over there, the attorney general of Mississippi basically outlawed abortion in that state and so they're in legal battle with the federal government right now and so he was there visiting the Mississippi attorney general and also he's actively involved with the pro-life movement in Korea and he also mentioned that there's something going on, pro-life movement in Japan, and so again, this has given him an opportunity to trigger the sanctity of life, you know, and it's moving in that way. And so, again, all of this came from decades of suffering in this home that God chose to use as a platform to speak for this and because he's a pastor, it's not just about the sanctity of life. Ultimately, the gospel is being spread as an avenue to do that, so we're so blessed to have them here. So I have just a couple more questions, something, one more that is a bit more personal. And so the last question I'd like to ask is coming from how would you encourage a parent who has a disabled child and for years of struggling that you went through and how would you encourage them practically to endure and persevere so that they may-- - Single mothers. - Not just single mothers, like parents who have disabled children. - Parents and disabled children, yeah. - What kind of encouragement can you give? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - If you, among us, if you have disabled children, I think that is kind of a special blessing and very specialty. Through the week, we can experience God's special grace in the family. Serve him or her and take care of him with all your heart. And you can, yeah, what I experienced. My suggestion is not kind of imagine. My suggestion is not a theory. I experienced that also already. So I can firmly tell like this. If you have disabled children, that is a special blessing from God. You can find out the blessing from God and you can find out the power of grace of the Lord. - Okay, I lied. I have actually one more question. - No matter. - Yeah, so as we close up, Pastor Lee, what two prayer requests would you leave with us so that we can pray for you after this meeting? (speaking in foreign language) (audience laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (laughing) I'm sorry. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (audience laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (audience laughing) - I cannot interpret this. (speaking in foreign language) - One more idea. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Yeah. (audience laughing) Additionally speaking, Pastor Jimmy introduced the special regulation and he want to additional speaking. Pursuit of deliverance, delivery, pursuit of baby delivery, that is the name of the special regulation. Indeed, in Germany and France, did it also. Some pregnant woman can registration, pursue the name. Then the real record can be protected in family court, not family record. So she can do baby delivery safely. So it is very good chance and very good option for the ladies in crisis. (speaking in foreign language) - This rule has included the right to recognize the biological parents. If the adoptee or the pursuit of being born under pursuit of name, he or she want to find out their biological mother or father, they can search out in family court. So this specialty included protecting the mother side and the baby side. It's very balanced good law, I think. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (audience laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - This regulation included in Korean, (speaking in foreign language) and that means father side responsibility. When I make a counseling in Bay Box with single mothers, they say all the same story. I can hear from them, same and old story. In that story, they're a bad guy. When talk to the guy, I'm pregnant, and he said, "Oh my God," and he disappeared and changing his phone number, and he cannot find out him anymore. So in the story, there is always a bad guy. Then he said, "Yeah." Preparing a kind of punishment relating to driving license and passport and the salary, so he want to put on the responsibility to the biological father of the babies in crisis. So he insisted that that law could be tuned up the property of physical relationship in Korea. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Please pray for Babock's Pursuit of Death Ministry. I believe that that ministry is very unique and very special and different from other Baby Boxes. I can help so many countries, I can help underdeveloped country to protect their people safely. So Babock's Ministry would be needed in many countries, so pray for to be spread, the Baby Box Ministry, in Korean style. Counseling and supporting and save the babies in crisis. Like that. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - I have a beloved wife and great co-worker in this Pursuit of Death Ministry, and a mother of about 2,000 babies. Her name is Byung Ok Chung, and she's wonderful sister in faith. Then she got diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, so she struggled on the disease. Please pray for her honestly. I beg you, pray for her. Pray for her health and beautiful life, blessed life. Please pray for her. - Okay, as we wrap up, the reason why I asked for two so that I wouldn't forget. (audience laughing) So let me summarize real quick, and then we're gonna take a minute, and then we're gonna wrap up. First of all, the prayer for Korea to pass an anti-abortion law, which is actively engaged in. Second, there's a legislation that actually he hired lawyers to make, and it's so that they are able to give the birth anonymously, because a lot of these babies are being aborted because of the shame and the circumstances around it. And so if they do that, and then they report it in the family court instead of the government court, that they will be protected, and more children will be able to be alive as a result of that. And so that was the second one. The third one was so that the men who are involved in this, there's a tendency that once they find out that their girlfriend, whoever is pregnant, that they would run off. So the second legislation that he's trying to get passed is to keep them responsible. So they would go after their driver's license, passport, and salary, and so that they would be engaged in raising this child at some point when it's necessary. The fourth law that he, or fourth thing that he asked for was that right now, like Baby Box Ministry is a unique ministry in Korea because it's not just saving babies, but they also take time to counsel the young ladies that come, and to be able to give support for them so that they would continue to be able to do that. So he's partnering with officials in high places in various countries to bring that to a lot of these countries. And he said that one of the things that really grieves our heart is that as he goes to these countries, and some of these countries are very wealthy countries like Japan, where they have no support for children who are being born that's just being abandoned. So they said that a lot of these missionaries and pastors are walking around seeing abandoned fetuses wherever they go. And so one of the prayer requests is that the contacts that he has with them that they will be able to pass laws to be able to protect. So Baby Box type of ministries will pop up all over the world. And then fourth and finally, as you just heard his wife, you know we were talking and he said that she was diagnosed with Alzheimer not too long ago, very recently. And she would have been here if it wasn't the case. And so she's there, she has to rest. But she's a very crucial part of this ministry. So he's asking that God would heal her until the day she is called back home and to be able to run with him. And again, a very important part of his ministry is her ministry. So if you can, we can pray for that. Okay, so I am going to pray and we're going to end it. But Pastor Lee brought up this, I don't know what this is, this is a clarinet flute? I don't think it's a comfort stick. So he, (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) Clarinet, but clarinet little, right? (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (clarinet music) (speaking in foreign language) (audience applauding) Let's all pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord God, to bring your precious servant, Pastor Lee, here with us, to encourage us, to remind us, Lord God, of your amazing grace, that even in the midst of trials and hardship, Lord God, how you have turned darkness into light in this family, in this home. We thank you, Father God, for his sacrifice. We thank you more than anything else for the grace of his love for you, that reflects in the sacrifices that he's made. Lord, we pray, Lord God, that as you have established him to fight this good fight, give him the strength that he needs, give him the support that he needs, Lord God, give him the courage and the faith and the joy and the life that he needs, Lord God, to continue this fight. We pray, Father God, for your grace. We pray for physical rest. We pray for his precious wife, Lord God, that you will bring healing. Lord, you know, Lord, how much she means to him. I pray, Father God, that you would allow her to run with him to the end. We pray, Father, that your grace truly would be sufficient with all the legislation that they are trying to pass, with all the connections that they are making here and around the world. I pray that you, who began a good work, Lord God, in him and through him, would carry it onto completion by the power of the Holy Spirit until you come. So for that end, we pray for strength. For that end, we pray for Pastor Lee, for Pastor Jimmy, for the people that they are traveling with, Lord God, that your anointing would be clear upon them. Every connection that they make, Lord, would cause greater fruit. And everywhere he speaks, Lord God, that there would be your grace and people would be inspired to be challenged, Lord God, to move as he has moved, to be used by you in a mighty way. And so we pray, Father God, that you would give him the physical rest that he needs as he is recovering, Lord God, from jet lag. We ask, Lord, that you would give him good sleep, help him, Lord God, to have the energy that he needs. And more than anything else, Lord God, that your presence would go with him wherever he goes. For that end, we lift him up to you, Father. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. All right, let's thank Pastor Lee and Pastor Jimmy for the time that they've given us, okay? All right. All right, so with that, we'll conclude our session today. All right, thank you for coming. (applause) (applause) (applause) (applause) (applause)</p></div></body></html>
