I like to go by B, but yeah, just if you see me, I might forget to respond to Beatrice. But yeah, this is my testimony. I've attended church from an early age. My parents were active in the church, so growing up there was seldom a free Sunday morning. The first time I can recall hearing the gospel message was when I was seven years old during a gospel presentation at VBS. On the surface, I understood the gospel story and desired to grow in my knowledge of God and his role as my Lord and Savior. However, I didn't understand the depths of my sin. My desire was merely to be a good child. My definition of good was performative as it came from the ways that others view me and would describe me. It wasn't really hard for me to modify my actions to look that way. It wasn't until the eighth grade that the gospel became more than a story to me. Since the fourth grade, I had no concern over the sins of my tongue and profanity ran rampant in my everyday speech. It was used to express the unloving thoughts that I had. In Ephesians 4, Paul wrote about the life that believers are called to live. Verse 29 says, "Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that so that it will give grace to those who hear." When I compared the way that I lived my life to what God desired, I realized that I had fallen short of his command. Recalling the gospel message that I had previously heard countless times, I finally saw my sin as a personal offense against God. I saw that I was completely at his mercy, and in his mercy, he also gifted me grace through Jesus' death on the cross. I saw that it was only by the blood that Jesus shed that my sins could be atoned for, that God's wrath could be satisfied, and I could still live. This is when I began to make active efforts to live my life in a manner that was pleasing and acceptable to God. Since then, God has continued to do his good work in sanctifying me. Following my conversion, I took great pride in my ability to continue to conform to outward standards of what a Christian looked like. God graciously revealed my self-reliant and pride attitude in the clearest way during college. The bold and unapologetic preaching, coupled with constant accountability and investment, were all means of loving discipline from my Heavenly Father. Though my sin has been paid for and I am seen righteous before God because I am covered by Christ's blood, I still have many sinful habits that I must work to kill through the enabling of the Holy Spirit. Today, I publicly confess and recognize the innateness of my sin, the inability to turn from it out of my own accord, and the never-ending need for Christ to successfully maintain my relationship with God. I was previously baptized during my freshman year of high school in 2014 through the mode of sprinkling. It wasn't until I came to Brewery Inn that I was both challenged and encouraged to form a personal conviction regarding the ordinance of baptism. After a year and a half of studying, having conversations, and praying, I desired to be fully and completely obedient to His command given through His Word because my life is no longer lived for myself but for Him. I recognize that His command is to participate in baptism through immersion. I have seen that His Lordship over my life constitutes every aspect of it, not only the spiritual. So I am being baptized here today as a means of displaying my heart's desire to obey and please my God who has been faithful, persistent, and patient in His pursuit after me and continues to be as He works to sanctify me. Thank you.  >> All right. We are going to be taking a few minutes to pray. So if you would like to join me in prayer, I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center of the room.
