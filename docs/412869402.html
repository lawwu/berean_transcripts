first verse of our passage, verse seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=175s">00:02:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a topic

of us, grace was given according to the measure of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=182s">00:03:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ's gift."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=183s">00:03:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=184s">00:03:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, because it's a topic sentence, it's good to identify each element of this sentence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=191s">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=192s">00:03:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the very first thing we're going to identify is the contraction there, or conjunction there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=199s">00:03:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the word "but."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=201s">00:03:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We ask this question, what is being contrasted?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=204s">00:03:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We ask the question, hmm, what is the summary of verse seven that is being juxtaposed against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=210s">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what was stated before?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=211s">00:03:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=212s">00:03:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we noticed from before was that there was such unity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=216s">00:03:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you recall, in verses one through six of chapter four, there was this repetition of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=221s">00:03:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the word "one."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=223s">00:03:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There was one this, and there was one that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=224s">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There was one body, there was one spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=226s">00:03:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=227s">00:03:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There was one baptism, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=229s">00:03:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we think about it, clearly there was an emphasis on the theme of unity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=234s">00:03:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=235s">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then here, in this sentence, in verse seven, it's stating, "But to each one of us," it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=243s">00:04:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is highlighting this idea of individuality within the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=248s">00:04:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=249s">00:04:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, one of the ways that a commentator, James Montgomery Boyce, states it, is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=256s">00:04:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul takes great lengths to stress the unity of the church within this same thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=262s">00:04:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in a balanced thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=263s">00:04:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yet, it is a particular kind of unity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=266s">00:04:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a kind of unity that sustains great diversity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=270s">00:04:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have to keep in mind that there is a commonality, there is a unity by which there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=277s">00:04:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is sameness, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=280s">00:04:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a same baptism, same experience, I said, same identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=285s">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=286s">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so much so, it supersedes a lot of the differences that we may have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=290s">00:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, God intentionally designed to preserve the individuality that he has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=296s">00:04:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">created us to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=297s">00:04:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And a good example of that, essentially, like the thumb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=301s">00:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If we were to think of ourselves each as individual thumbs, but the thing about it is, each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=307s">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">us has a fingerprint that is unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=310s">00:05:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That is so unique that not a single person has the exact same fingerprint as another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=315s">00:05:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So another passage, a cross-reference to highlight this, is from a passage that should be familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=321s">00:05:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to every single one of you, because we go over it for every member's induction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=327s">00:05:27.280</a></span> | <span

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1554s">00:25:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul highlights though, he doesn't specifically say

have to take note of this, the degree of descent and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1563s">00:26:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ascent,

what he said is, when you think about this idea of he went up, what does it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1571s">00:26:11.880</a></span> | <span

came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1579s">00:26:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">down and where, what are these lower parts of the

the distance between where Christ was, where in the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1594s">00:26:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was

for him to come down to us as incarnate man, that would be an incredible descent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/412869402#t=1604s">00:26:44.480</a></span> |
