You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=14s">00:00:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know, he was famous for, he was the founder of psychoanalysis. Or there are some who follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=20s">00:00:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual leaders, like the Dalai Lama, for example, right, who was the head monk of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=26s">00:00:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Buddhist order. So when people say that they're disciples, what they mean by that is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=31s">00:00:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they're following the teaching and the examples of others, okay? But similarly, when we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=38s">00:00:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about what does it mean to be a true disciple of Christ, what we're saying, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=43s">00:00:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about here is that a true disciple of Christ is somebody who follows in his footsteps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=53s">00:00:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and does as he taught and of course as he lived. And you know, but in order to follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=59s">00:00:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ and to be Christ-like, what has to happen first? We have to what? We have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=65s">00:01:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">enter into a relationship with Christ himself. And that's really where true discipleship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=72s">00:01:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">begins. It begins when, you know, scripture talks about in Romans 10 that if you confess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=78s">00:01:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and you believe in your heart that God raised him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=83s">00:01:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from the dead, then you're going to be saved. For with a heart, for with your heart, a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=88s">00:01:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually believes, resulting in righteousness. Well, what you're believing from the heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=93s">00:01:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually is that he not only raised him from the dead, but he rose again and that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=100s">00:01:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">result in righteousness. And with the mouth, you confess, resulting in salvation. So being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=106s">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a disciple of Jesus Christ always begins with what he has done for the believer. It always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=112s">00:01:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">begins with that. So let's think about that for a moment. What exactly has Jesus done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=117s">00:01:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, ladies, you have to get the gospel right. Because if you don't get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=121s">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel right, you are going to be so shaped and influenced by the people out there that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=125s">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are getting the gospel wrong. And just as an aside, I wanted to throw this out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=130s">00:02:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get a chance to watch the American Gospel, that is an excellent film. It's out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=135s">00:02:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there. You can even get it on your on-demand right now. But you need to know the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=141s">00:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very clear. We know that Jesus is the one that lived the perfect life that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=145s">00:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">should have lived when he was here in human form. And he died the death that we should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=150s">00:02:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have died. And he offered himself up as a substitute and a sacrifice for everyone who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=157s">00:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is willing to turn from their sin and to trust in him alone. And so being a disciple of Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=164s">00:02:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really begins when one has accepted the free gift of grace given by God. And that is turning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=172s">00:02:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from your sin again, fully trusting in that finished work of Christ, and who is your Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=179s">00:02:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, of course we know that salvation is not of our own doing. It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=184s">00:03:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because of any good works you've done. It's all about that faith and that finished work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=189s">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by your faith alone in Christ alone. So that's one aspect of it. But also, part of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=196s">00:03:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a disciple is denying self. Jesus talks a lot about that. We don't necessarily talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=203s">00:03:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about the cost of being a disciple. But a true disciple is one that denies self. Luke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=210s">00:03:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">9, 23, Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself," which means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=218s">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">believers with the help of the Holy Spirit are willingly of their own accord saying no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=223s">00:03:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to self. And that's hard, right? Because you have to say no to your flesh, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=228s">00:03:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actually one of your enemies that you're dealing with. But we must say no to self,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=233s">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and we willingly set our desires and our wants and our lusts, and we bring those into submission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=241s">00:04:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to Jesus Christ. A true disciple is also somebody who not only denies self but willingly takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=248s">00:04:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up her cross. In Mark 8, 34, Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=255s">00:04:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and come after me and take up his cross." And that's just another way of saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=260s">00:04:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">by the act of your will, you are saying yes to Christ and his will, which again, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=268s">00:04:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can be quite painful, right? Because we again battle three enemies. I already said the flesh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=275s">00:04:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're also battling the world. And of course, you're battling Satan himself because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=280s">00:04:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he likes to discourage believers, of course. And then finally, a true disciple follows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=288s">00:04:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">him. Jesus says in Matthew 16, 24 to 25, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=297s">00:04:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">take up his cross, and follow me." So for whoever would save his life will lose it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=302s">00:05:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. To follow Christ means to obey Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=310s">00:05:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus says in John 15, 14, "You are my friends if you do what I command you." So out of love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=316s">00:05:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for Christ, it's always an out of a love for Christ, right? We're not talking about moral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=321s">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">living. I mean, we are talking about moral living, but it has to come from a heart that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=325s">00:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">loves Christ. That has to be your motivator. We obey out of love for Christ. We obey because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=331s">00:05:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to glorify him. To follow Christ also means to have just a fervent love for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=339s">00:05:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">another. So as a body of Christ, you know, all who belong to him, hopefully, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=347s">00:05:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're spending time with each other, practicing the one another's, building relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=352s">00:05:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the world will know that you are one of his by how you treat one another. John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=359s">00:05:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">13, 35 says, "By this will men know that you are my disciples if you have love for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=365s">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">another." And so a true disciple desires to serve one another in the body of Christ. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=373s">00:06:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so discipleship to Christ really begins when we hear these words, "To deny self, to pick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=381s">00:06:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">up your cross, and to follow him, and then to obey those words." That's what Jesus tells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=387s">00:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">us in his word. And so as true disciples, we are called to listen to him. In fact, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=395s">00:06:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you are a Christian, it's the same, you know, to say that you're a Christian is the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=399s">00:06:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thing as saying that you're a disciple of Christ. They didn't use Christian that much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=404s">00:06:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the actual label Christian in the Bible as much as they would say the way or a disciple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=408s">00:06:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But it means the same thing. And so when we say we are a disciple of Christ, we're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=414s">00:06:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're committed to following in his footsteps according to his word and doing as he taught</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=421s">00:07:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and living by the power and strength of the Holy Spirit. And that's just where faith comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=426s">00:07:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in. I mean, real faith, that's real faith in action. No longer living for self, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=431s">00:07:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">living for Christ. The Apostle Paul probably reiterates that truth the best when he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=437s">00:07:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in Galatians 2.20, "I've been crucified with Christ. It's no longer I who live, but Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=444s">00:07:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">who lives in me. And so now the life that I now live, I live by faith in the Son of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=450s">00:07:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">God who loved me and gave himself for me." So the Christian life is the discipled life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=457s">00:07:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It does start with that, but it also is the discipling life. It's not just a let go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=463s">00:07:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">let God. There's a big part of striving for holiness while abiding in Christ. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=470s">00:07:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we who are called to follow Christ, we're also commissioned by Jesus himself to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=475s">00:07:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">help others to follow Christ. In fact, when we take initiative and we come alongside and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=482s">00:08:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we disciple others, it demonstrates our obedience out of love for God. Again, Jesus in John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=490s">00:08:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">14.15 says, "If we love him, we will keep his commandments." And one of his commandments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=496s">00:08:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to all true disciples is to disciple others. And that's kind of where we're going to focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=499s">00:08:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">tonight. Why don't you turn to Matthew 28. And we're just going to kind of focus on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=509s">00:08:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Great Commission. And I'm hoping that I'm going to have time to get through all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=513s">00:08:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">notes tonight, but I promise you if we don't get to cover everything, we'll just pick up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=518s">00:08:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">where we left off tomorrow morning. But Matthew 28. So as you're turning there, this passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=526s">00:08:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is known as the Great Commission. You're familiar with it, right? Yeah, the Great Commission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=532s">00:08:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really our biblical support, I think, for when we start talking about, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=537s">00:08:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">making disciples. We have to allow scripture to shape that, not someone's program. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=543s">00:09:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's good for you to just kind of look at this passage with fresh eyes, and we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=548s">00:09:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of think through it a little bit because it's really important. But Matthew 28, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=553s">00:09:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">then just go to verse 18, and I'm just going to read from 18 to 20. "And Jesus came up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=561s">00:09:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=567s">00:09:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=573s">00:09:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=580s">00:09:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'" So as you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=587s">00:09:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there, that's a concluding passage, right, in Matthew. And again, referred to the Great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=594s">00:09:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Commission. And the cool thing is we just celebrated resurrection, right? The cool thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=599s">00:09:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is this happened a week later. So the timeline is this would have been about seven or eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=605s">00:10:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">days later, after Christ had resurrected, and he's appearing to different people. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=611s">00:10:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">he met with his disciples in Galilee about seven to eight days later after the resurrection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=618s">00:10:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, the reason why he met with them is he wanted to commission them. He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=625s">00:10:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of passing the baton, so to speak, and giving them some instructions. But it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=629s">00:10:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">just isolated to the disciples then. This is for all of us who claim the name of Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=636s">00:10:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and who desire to make disciples of all people. So as we begin to kind of unpack this passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=643s">00:10:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to kind of just silently pray in your heart and, you know, allow the passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=650s">00:10:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to really awaken your hearts this evening. Allow it to impact you and renew you in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=656s">00:10:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">individual calling, because we're all called to do this. This is not just for your pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=662s">00:11:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">or for your elders or for your women's ministry or whatever. This is for all of us individually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=668s">00:11:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as I'm teaching through this, allow it to impact you personally, because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=673s">00:11:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">meant to. It's the church's calling, and the church is not a building, right? The church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=678s">00:11:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is made up of a body of believers, and so this is an individual calling as much as it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=683s">00:11:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a church calling. So let's bow our heads right now, and I'll just go ahead and pray. Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=689s">00:11:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">God, thank you so much for allowing me to come here today and to open up the Word with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=696s">00:11:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">these ladies who love you and more just desire to grow more in their faith. And Father, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=705s">00:11:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">just a wonderful opportunity to start from the beginning. When your dear Son rose again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=713s">00:11:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">on the third day, and Father just appeared to all of those who didn't even believe that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=718s">00:11:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">he really would do that. And here he is meeting with the original disciples, commissioning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=724s">00:12:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">them, and because we know that your Word gives us everything we need for our life and godliness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=730s">00:12:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's put there for our instruction, we know that these words are meant for us today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=735s">00:12:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just pray that as we go through this passage carefully, that you'll just impact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=741s">00:12:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">each heart out there today. I know that when your Word goes out, it never returns void,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=747s">00:12:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and so I'm just trusting you, Lord, to do the work. In Jesus' name, amen. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=754s">00:12:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we've got, we'll begin with the claim of Christ, okay, the claim of Christ to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=760s">00:12:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">disciples. As Jesus gathered his eleven disciples up on that mountain in Galilee, he claims</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=767s">00:12:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in verse 18, "All authority has been given, all authority in heaven and in earth has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=774s">00:12:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">given to me." So to begin, before we can even look at what Jesus is commanding us to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=782s">00:13:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">as far as making disciples, you need to know that it's really, really important that Jesus'</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=787s">00:13:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">claim as to his authority is the basis for everything that we do. You have to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=793s">00:13:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">have a firm, just claim or just trust in that. And so what is Jesus really claiming here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=802s">00:13:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Look back at your scripture there. What is the first thing that we notice? He's claiming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=807s">00:13:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to have authority in heaven and earth. Did you know that that was prophesied in the Old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=812s">00:13:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament? When he claims to have authority in heaven and earth, Daniel actually talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=818s">00:13:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">about that. In chapter 7, verse 14, there was a time when Daniel prophesied that Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=827s">00:13:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">would be, there would be, well, he said there would be a son of man who was given all authority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=833s">00:13:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to rule and to have glory and to have a kingdom of every people, nation, and language who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=838s">00:13:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">would serve him. A kingdom that is an everlasting kingdom which will never pass away or be destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=845s">00:14:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's interesting that that text is actually talking about Jesus or the Messiah to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=851s">00:14:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what Jesus is claiming here in this passage. He is the one that Daniel was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=856s">00:14:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about. But Jesus also makes a claim about his authority over every believer in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=862s">00:14:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this room. In other words, Jesus is your personal Lord and Savior. Okay? You didn't just decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=870s">00:14:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">one day to make Jesus Lord and Savior. By the authority given to him in heaven and earth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=876s">00:14:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus just is Lord and Savior. You know what I'm saying? Right? Yeah. And, you know, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=882s">00:14:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">read about that all over scripture. One that I'm thinking of right now is Philippians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=886s">00:14:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">2, 9 to 11, where after Jesus died and rose again, you know, he was exalted. So when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=892s">00:14:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">rose again, which you guys probably learned on Sunday from your own pastor, when he rose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=897s">00:14:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">again he eventually ascended and is at the Father's right hand. So he is Lord over all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=904s">00:15:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">creation no matter what the world tells you. He is Lord of all creation. He has absolute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=911s">00:15:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">authority over nature, nations, diseases, sin, demons, death, and over every life in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=919s">00:15:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the world. And one day, even though the world has no clue, one day, one truth that we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=927s">00:15:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure is that every knee will bow. Every knee. Every knee will bow and every tongue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=933s">00:15:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">will confess Jesus is Lord. That is a guarantee. And so when we're talking about the Great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=939s">00:15:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Commission, like I said before, we're not talking about some special man-made program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=944s">00:15:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in your church. Because a lot of churches kind of make it seem like that. But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=949s">00:15:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">not where we're at. We're talking about the authority that has been given to Christ in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=954s">00:15:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">heaven and on earth. And that's what should motivate your hearts to make disciples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=958s">00:15:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">others. It's just thinking about who Christ is and the authority that he has in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=965s">00:16:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we go and we disciple others to follow Christ because we love Christ ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=973s">00:16:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to acknowledge his authority to others. That's hard on college campuses, isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=979s">00:16:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it? That's hard. I know what you guys are facing. I realize I work at a Christian school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=983s">00:16:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but I deal with the secular community and counseling. And I know that's hard. But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=988s">00:16:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">have to stand firm in what we believe. And you don't need to be afraid, by the way, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=995s">00:16:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the word has authority.

You just need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=999s">00:16:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to allow God to do his work and allow the word to do his work. OK? But, you know, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1005s">00:16:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">disciple others to follow Christ because we love Christ ourselves.

I mean, he is. And we are his subjects, so to speak. And we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1015s">00:16:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to give him the worship that's due his name. I mean, I love it when we get to open up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1020s">00:17:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">singing.

I mean, it's part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1025s">00:17:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">worshiping our king because that is who he is. And we should all desire for others to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1031s">00:17:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">say and confess with their own mouth that Jesus is Lord. Right? Amen on that? Yes. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1040s">00:17:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen and amen. Now, after Jesus claims his authority over heaven and earth to his disciples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1046s">00:17:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when he begins to urge the disciples to make disciples. He says, "Go, therefore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1054s">00:17:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and make disciples of all nations." And so really what he's saying there is he's saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1058s">00:17:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"In light of my authority, I want you to go." That's the command, to go. If you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1065s">00:17:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">parse it out in the original language, actually that verb translated "go" is a present participle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1071s">00:17:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you like that for college students? But it's a present participle, going. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1077s">00:17:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so what Jesus is saying to all of us who consider ourselves true disciples of Christ is, "While</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1082s">00:18:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you are going, make disciples of all the nations." So no matter where you're going, you're called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1089s">00:18:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be actively witnessing for Christ by seeking to win others to him and then teaching new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1094s">00:18:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">disciples to follow him or teaching them what you yourself have been taught according to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1101s">00:18:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the scriptures. And that's how it's been from the beginning and will be to the end. To be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1107s">00:18:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a disciple is to make disciples. I mean, scripture doesn't know of any disciple in the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1113s">00:18:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not making disciples. That's normal Christian living. That is part of being a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1118s">00:18:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian is making disciples. In fact, in this entire passage, there's really only one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1125s">00:18:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">main command to his disciples, which is to make disciples. Okay? Now, when we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1133s">00:18:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about making disciples, within that passage itself, there's four goals that we can look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1139s">00:18:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at that's really, really helpful, I think, as you're kind of thinking through this whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1143s">00:19:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">issue. And the first one, of course, is just to share the truth about Christ. According</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1150s">00:19:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to verse 19, the early disciples were told to go beyond the nation of Israel, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1155s">00:19:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">were called to call others to repentance and belief. And so these disciples spoke the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1161s">00:19:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as they lived out the gospel. And it's not any different today. I mean, as we're going,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1166s">00:19:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we should be sharing the gospel as we have opportunity. You know, I mean, it's one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1173s">00:19:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">those things where you have to pray for opportunity, and you have to be willing to share when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1178s">00:19:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">get opportunity. Again, I think what stops people is fear of man. Right? We just need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1184s">00:19:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to trust that the Lord is going to do his work, and trust in the authority that Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1189s">00:19:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">has and that he has in his word. I think a really practical way to share Christ, to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1194s">00:19:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">quite honest, is to just, you know, grab coffee with somebody and to just share your testimony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1200s">00:20:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that is a great way to break the ice. You know, you're building relationships with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1205s">00:20:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people, and they want to know what's different about you. That's what always comes up. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1209s">00:20:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">want to know why, when I'm around you, you're not acting like the world. What's different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1215s">00:20:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about you? Why do you have joy when you go through trials? You know, why are you not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1219s">00:20:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cursing like the rest of them? Kind of a thing. And so, a great way is just to share your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1225s">00:20:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">testimony. You know, part of my testimony, I was liberal as all get out, ladies. Totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1232s">00:20:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">feminist. My neighbor, a woman, her name is Jodi, I love her, took a risk. She came over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1240s">00:20:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">when we bought our first house, and she became my friend. And through that friendship, over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1247s">00:20:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">time, she began to share her testimony. And then she began to share more truth. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1254s">00:20:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it just kind of goes on and on. And then she began to invite me to church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1258s">00:20:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so, the good news is, is the church was solid. And so I heard the gospel every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1264s">00:21:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">single Sunday because we had a very faithful gospel preacher, you know. And it's just amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1271s">00:21:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to me to think that she took a risk, number one, because it was probably a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1275s">00:21:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">intimidating. But as she was witnessing to me, and as the pastor was doing his work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1281s">00:21:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching well, the Spirit of God was bearing witness to me through these people in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1288s">00:21:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And God is the one in his kindness and mercy who granted me repentance and redeemed my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1295s">00:21:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">heart as I placed my faith in that finished work. So, praise the Lord. Jodi obeyed the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1300s">00:21:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord, you know, and she was willing to come and reach out to me and share the truth about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1306s">00:21:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">him. So, maybe you have neighbors. How many of you have neighbors? All of us have neighbors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1312s">00:21:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. You know, whom you need to reach out to. You just never know what God's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1317s">00:21:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do. You know, you can share Christ with God. Actually, he doesn't have to, but God does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1324s">00:22:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">use people to get the gospel to others. I never grew, I didn't grow up in a Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1328s">00:22:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">family.

I wouldn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1338s">00:22:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talked to them. So, it's just amazing that the Lord used somebody in that way in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1345s">00:22:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just amazing that I was even willing to listen to her. But God is the one doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1352s">00:22:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the work.

But according to the second part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1368s">00:22:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 19, when people respond to the gospel, that is to say they've turned from their sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1374s">00:22:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they've turned to Christ, from that point, they symbolize their identification with Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1381s">00:23:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through believers' baptism, right?

And that's actually a command from Christ himself. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1393s">00:23:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't get baptized to become a Christian, right?

Okay? Now, not only does Jesus commission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1528s">00:25:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">his disciples to share the truth about him and symbolize or identify with him through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1533s">00:25:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">baptism, but really the third goal of making disciples is to be committed to showing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1541s">00:25:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">word of God by teaching others to obey Jesus's commands.

So teaching us that we don't just receive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1561s">00:26:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the word from those who witness to us like my neighbor did. And you know, sometimes people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1566s">00:26:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">get saved and they just sit in their churches, they soak it in, and then I call, what I say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1572s">00:26:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is they sour because they're not doing anything. They just sit, soak, and sour. And they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1578s">00:26:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">show up week after week and they don't do anything. They don't involve themselves in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1582s">00:26:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the body of Christ. Actually, true disciples of Christ have a biblical responsibility to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1588s">00:26:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">show the word of God through evangelism and through teaching others what they themselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1594s">00:26:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have been taught. And part of showing the word does happen in our local churches as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1599s">00:26:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you listen to your pastor preach week after week, but also showing the word of God happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1604s">00:26:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the life on life relationships.

That's an important aspect of the Christian life. Of course it's going to happen. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1617s">00:26:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">women are so relational. I'm sure it's happening all the time. When we meet regularly, it gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1622s">00:27:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">us an opportunity, especially with new believers, to model the Christian life by showing others</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1629s">00:27:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how to pray.

Did you know how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1633s">00:27:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pray? That's a tough one. You have to model that a lot of the times. We disciple because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1641s">00:27:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to teach people how to study God's word in context and just things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1647s">00:27:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how to grow in Christ through that, how to lead others to Christ. I mean, that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1651s">00:27:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">church life is all about. And so that's what making disciples is all about. And I praise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1657s">00:27:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">God for the women in my church when I was a new believer who came alongside me and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1663s">00:27:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just willingly and lovingly taught me so many things. Sometimes I would just meet with them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1668s">00:27:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in groups. You know, you have your typical women's Bible study and you learn lots that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1672s">00:27:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">way. But I just treasure those times when there were women that allowed me to come over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1678s">00:27:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to their home and they showed me how to be a godly wife and mother. I mean, that's tough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1684s">00:28:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because I already had children that were five, six, and a newborn. And so I had already poured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1690s">00:28:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in all of the psychologized self-esteem stuff into my kids. And I had to relearn how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1697s">00:28:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be a Christian parent. And I praise God for the, just the patience of some of these women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1703s">00:28:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who came alongside me and modeled, you know, Christ in their life. And that's just part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1707s">00:28:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of life on life. We're not an island. We're not to isolate from each other. That's a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1712s">00:28:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">part of Christian living. And so it's important for you as well to come alongside other women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1718s">00:28:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and have other women come alongside you. Discipleship is just so vital so that you can grow and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1725s">00:28:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can mature in Christ. And also just to be able to give that opportunity to model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1732s">00:28:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in daily life. That's just normal. In fact, we find support for this in Scripture. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1739s">00:28:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to invite you, we're going to, we're still under showing the word. So I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1742s">00:29:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going to invite you now to kind of turn to Titus 2. We're going to look at this for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1746s">00:29:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. We'll segue a little bit. And then we'll go back to our commission passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1752s">00:29:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, Scripture has a lot to say about women discipling other women. It's a big part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1758s">00:29:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of what we should be doing with one another, no matter if you're married, old, young, single,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1764s">00:29:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all called to do it. But Titus 2, 3 to 5, I'm going to read, Paul's writing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1772s">00:29:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of churches. He's not just writing to one church. He's writing to various churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1777s">00:29:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And he writes, "Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1784s">00:29:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or slaves to much wine. They're to teach what is good, and so train the younger women to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1790s">00:29:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1797s">00:29:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled." And so here we have Paul,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1803s">00:30:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">again, you know, there's primary things that are going on here. He needed Titus to go out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1810s">00:30:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and put in order what remained in the churches, and he also needed to appoint some elders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1815s">00:30:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There were a lot of things going on at the time. But part of what he was doing, as far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1821s">00:30:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as putting in order what remained, was trying to teach groups of people what was appropriate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1828s">00:30:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for sound doctrine. And we're looking at two of those groups, the older women and the younger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1834s">00:30:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">women. There's specific commands, obviously, for us. And as you can see, as far as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1840s">00:30:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">older woman goes, there's really no age that's particularly specified. I mean, we know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1845s">00:30:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">she was an older woman. We know that she was probably—we just assume that she's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1851s">00:30:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">married long enough to at least have something to say about marriage. We also know that she's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1858s">00:30:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">probably passed through the season of life, you know, probably has grown children, has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1863s">00:31:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">passed through the season of having little ones. He's probably talking about someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1868s">00:31:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like me, you know, someone that's a little more gray-haired. But, you know, in the New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1872s">00:31:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament times, I mean, women served all in the church in numerous ways, not just in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1878s">00:31:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this way. But here, Paul is just kind of talking about the responsibilities of older women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1885s">00:31:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to teach and train the younger. That's a big thing. And to teach and train the younger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1889s">00:31:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the things of the Lord, which is actually just another way of saying making disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1895s">00:31:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's kind of look a little bit at the older woman. What is she to be like? What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1901s">00:31:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that first characteristic? She's to be what in her behavior? Say the word. Yeah, reverent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1907s">00:31:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? She's to be reverent in her behavior. And that's an adjective, okay? It's an unusual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1914s">00:31:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">combination if you look in the original language. It's kind of like saying, it's kind of a weird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1922s">00:32:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">word really, but he kind of just means like being a priestess in a temple, somebody that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1929s">00:32:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, has a holy way of living. And do you guys know who Anna the prophetess is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1935s">00:32:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Luke? She would be an example of what Paul, where Paul is getting at. She was widowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1940s">00:32:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at a young age. Anna was probably widowed when she was in her 20s. It's kind of amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1945s">00:32:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about, especially in that culture. And she didn't remarry. So what she did her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1951s">00:32:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">whole life is she prayed day and night and fasted in front of the temple until Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1957s">00:32:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">came. It's a wonderful story. And so she was known for being devout and holy. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1966s">00:32:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of what he's getting at here. An older woman, an older Titus 2 woman should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1971s">00:32:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reverence in that way. You know, it also says that older women are not supposed to be slanderers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1979s">00:32:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And that is kind of an interesting word again, because it means not to be devilish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1985s">00:33:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or not to be malicious. And so the idea that Paul is trying to convey there is that people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1992s">00:33:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case older women, who cannot control their tongues by speaking lies or making false</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=1998s">00:33:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">accusations or spreading malicious gossip, whether it's true or not, is really doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2004s">00:33:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the work of Satan himself. And so, you know, that exhortation to master the tongue, why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2011s">00:33:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is it only especially directed towards women? What do you think? Do we kind of get caught</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2018s">00:33:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">up this way a little bit? Where there are many words, ladies, where there are many words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2024s">00:33:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we're going to exemplify, and I realize that a lot of you are not, you know, aged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2029s">00:33:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like me, you're young, but you should be aspiring or you should be training yourself up in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2036s">00:33:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">way. You need to think through these things. And, you know, you need to think about your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2042s">00:34:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations with one another. Are your conversations with one another God-honoring? Or are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2049s">00:34:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">getting caught up in gossip kind of thing? Are you using words that build up? Are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2055s">00:34:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">using words that edify? Are you giving grace to those who hear them? And so that's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2062s">00:34:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of where he's getting at, that we need to have, well, out of the heart the mouth speaks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2065s">00:34:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so really it's a heart issue if you're getting caught up in that. But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2070s">00:34:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what are your words like these days?

You know, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2084s">00:34:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">older woman isn't to be a drunkard.

I wonder if they had a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2092s">00:34:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trouble with drinking, which is interesting. And so, you know, that's kind of what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2099s">00:34:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">getting at specifically, but can we be enslaved to other things today?

And he gives us everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2308s">00:38:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we need for life and godliness.

I think in the church today, some other ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2384s">00:39:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this can be modeled is, you know, I would say probably biblical counseling would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2390s">00:39:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one, that formal setting.

You know, and then just kind of teaching them how to deal with things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2425s">00:40:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that.

I'll get a little bit deeper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2427s">00:40:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">into that. I think it can be a public ministry, too. For example, how many of you are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2434s">00:40:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in a small group? You know, that's kind of A-form. Yeah, quite a few of you. Where you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2440s">00:40:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">got a woman kind of leading you through the scriptures, because you want to learn it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2444s">00:40:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a deeper way, apply it to your life. And that's what that happens. Or even in a women's conference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2450s">00:40:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like this. And so again, you know, I'm thankful that I was allowed to experience all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2456s">00:40:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">things.

But to kind of sum up, on the issue of women making disciples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2468s">00:41:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">my pastor back home wrote this quote.

They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2577s">00:42:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to know how to deal with comparing themselves on social media. That's a hot issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2582s">00:43:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they really struggle with the self-image deal, comparing. They wanted to talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2588s">00:43:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how to handle when they have, most of them have a friend that's dealing with transgender</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2593s">00:43:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">issues.

Seriously. And so I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2616s">00:43:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of encouraged that they were even asking the question and we were even having the conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2620s">00:43:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was great.

But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=2644s">00:44:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that is normal Christian living.

Unruliness is not just one thing. So it's kind of tough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3133s">00:52:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to pinpoint all of them, but in Thessalonica, in that church, the unruly people were the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3141s">00:52:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people that refused to work.

And so, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3147s">00:52:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they were just kind of expecting others to come along and support them, but Paul says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3151s">00:52:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Look, if these people don't work, then they shouldn't eat." And so that kind of unruliness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3155s">00:52:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">can happen in a church. But more often than not, what you're going to see is unruliness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3161s">00:52:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're going to see in churches typically are people that slander the leadership, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3165s">00:52:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">know, say things to kind of divide the church.

So that's where he's getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3182s">00:53:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at. People who are enslaved to alcohol, that kind of thing. I mean, I was helping a woman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3187s">00:53:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in a local church who would say she's a committed believer, completely enslaved to alcohol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3193s">00:53:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know? That's how she handles her problems. She's under pressure. And that's her false</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3200s">00:53:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">savior. That's what she turns to, to deal with the pressure in her life. So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3204s">00:53:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of people that would name the name of Christ and still struggle in this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3209s">00:53:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">way. And that would be another example of unruliness. And so there's lots of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3213s">00:53:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds. But what does Paul say that we're to do with people like this? If we come alongside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3218s">00:53:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">someone that we care about that's engaging in unruly behavior, what are we supposed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3223s">00:53:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do? What does he say? What's that command there? Yeah, that's right. Admonish. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3232s">00:53:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know what? All that means is to warn. That's all that means. To warn them with the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3240s">00:54:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that we need to show them the consequence of their sinful conduct. That's why you warn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3245s">00:54:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">them, because you want to bring that to light. Not in front of your friends or in front of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3250s">00:54:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people. You do it in private. But that's the whole idea. Practically speaking, though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3258s">00:54:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">before I would ever admonish anybody, I wouldn't just, you know, run over to admonish a person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3264s">00:54:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I always take time to pray. I want to make sure that my motives are correct. I look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3270s">00:54:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the big old log in my eye before I look at the speck in my brother's eye or my sister's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3274s">00:54:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">eye. And I think through how I'm going to do it. You always want to do it in private,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3279s">00:54:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of course. But, you know, the whole goal of admonishment is restoration. It's not to condemn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3287s">00:54:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">people. You get me on that one? They're off track with Christ. It's about Christ and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3293s">00:54:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship with Christ. And so the whole idea is to try to come alongside and admonish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3299s">00:54:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">them and to warn them that they are going to go down a road that is not good. But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3305s">00:55:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">do this when there's a pattern of sin like that. And that woman that I was telling you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3309s">00:55:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about that was engaging in drunkenness, she was somebody that I needed to talk to in private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3316s">00:55:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just simply told her out of love for her, you are at a step with Christ and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3320s">00:55:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">rest of God's people. You're turning to a false God. And this is not, this is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3324s">00:55:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to end in disaster.

She's going to lose her marriage. She's going to, she's going to probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3334s">00:55:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">lose her job.

A good proverb that you can share with someone that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3341s">00:55:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">being unruly is Proverbs 13, 15, which says that good sense wins favor, but the way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3347s">00:55:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a transgressor is hard, you know.

But at a heart level, you know, a Christian who's being unruly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3367s">00:56:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't just, you can't just think about the behavior on the outside. That would make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3371s">00:56:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">us humanists. We got to really think about what's going on at the heart level. And essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3378s">00:56:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that's when we start asking deeper questions like what do they want that they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3382s">00:56:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not getting? Why do they want to have, you know, it's usually a pride issue. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3387s">00:56:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">why are they seeking to take Jesus' rightful place on the throne of their hearts? And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3393s">00:56:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">those are some things to think about.

And it was happening in the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3493s">00:58:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in Thessalonica. Think about that. That was over how many years ago? And so you have women</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3497s">00:58:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that were faint-hearted.

They were kind of struggling because they really thought they had loved ones that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3506s">00:58:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">had died.

Be looking out there in your church and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3576s">00:59:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have friends or women that might need some encouragement. Again, people are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3583s">00:59:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">through lots and lots of things and they need our encouragement. There's definitely more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3588s">00:59:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to be said about that. But I want to move on to helping the weak so we can kind of finish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3592s">00:59:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">on time because I want you to work through those questions. But another category is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3596s">00:59:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">helping the weak. It's another group of women that you'll probably find in your church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3602s">01:00:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">no doubt. You know, the definition for weak here kind of means people, those without strength.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3611s">01:00:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Not physically, but more spiritually. And the first one that he's referring to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3617s">01:00:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is a spiritually weak faith. And so those would be people that just kind of have a lack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3622s">01:00:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of knowledge of the will of God. Some through just a lack of courage to trust the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3629s">01:00:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they're facing persecution in their families or just from others. And it can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3635s">01:00:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">mean morally weak. You know, there are many people out there who just keep falling into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3640s">01:00:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the same sins over and over again. And so there are some women in your churches, unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3645s">01:00:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that just get carried away by their emotion and they struggle with self-control and with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3651s">01:00:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">their thought life. And in Thessalonica, Paul was kind of alluding to the weak being sexually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3658s">01:00:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">sexually tempted in chapter 4. But the command that we're given, I mean, we're not to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3665s">01:01:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">away from these people. You know, we recognize this is going on in their life and the command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3669s">01:01:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're given is to help them. But it has a much bigger meaning than what we think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3674s">01:01:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, help. What Paul has in mind there is to give sympathetic assistance. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3681s">01:01:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of that idea of supporting a weak person by keeping yourself directly over against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3687s">01:01:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the weak so you are sustaining them. And Paul talks about that actually in Galatians 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3693s">01:01:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">1. You who are spiritual, if you're caught up in a trespass, you are to restore such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3698s">01:01:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a one. So you're picking these people up, you're bearing their burdens, and you're holding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3704s">01:01:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">them up. And, you know, the church is just full of weak people. It's, you know, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3709s">01:01:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">they're just new believers, they come out of hard lives, and there's just lots and lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3714s">01:01:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of things that we can really encourage and help them in. But Jesus, who is the believer's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3720s">01:02:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect example of discipleship, really helped those who were weak. And you know what? Peter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3724s">01:02:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">actually was an example of a weak believer in the beginning anyway, before Jesus was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3729s">01:02:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">crucified. He was often very frail, he was often very half-hearted, but Jesus helped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3735s">01:02:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">him to face his weaknesses. And, of course, we have learned lots from Peter. It's amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3742s">01:02:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">how he had such full devotion at the end. And then the last thing that I want to point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3748s">01:02:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">out in 1 Thessalonians is that Paul says that we need to be patient with all men. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3756s">01:02:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a category of people, that's everyone else who does not fit into the first three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3761s">01:02:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">categories but actually in those who do. So it's kind of a both/and. He's saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3766s">01:02:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">all men, all women, need to be patient with people as God sanctifies them. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3771s">01:02:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">something you're going to run into because if you're really serious about making disciples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3776s">01:02:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">one thing that I've noticed, and I train counselors all the time too, one thing I notice, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3781s">01:03:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe even Esther can confirm, sometimes when we come alongside people we want them to grow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3786s">01:03:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritually really fast on our own timing. Right? And we can't figure out why they aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3793s">01:03:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">growing at the fast pace that we think they should. So we need to remember that God does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3799s">01:03:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the sanctifying. He's just using us as an instrument in his hand to get the word to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3804s">01:03:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">them and to come alongside and encourage them, but he does the growing. And so God is asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3811s">01:03:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">us to have a steady patience with people that really expresses that long spiritedness and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332880970#t=3817s">01:03:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a slowness to anger, which of course is reflective of God's steady patience with us all the time.</span></div></div></body></html>
