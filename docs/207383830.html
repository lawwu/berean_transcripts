read it for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=162s">00:02:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "In the same way, you wives, be

<span class="t">If I were to just do a simple summary and outline of this passage, I would just make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=189s">00:03:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a command, the main point, be submissive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=193s">00:03:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a clear, "so that" the non-believers may be won.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=197s">00:03:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a means or the content of how you're going to apply that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=202s">00:03:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "By the behavior and character of your life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=204s">00:03:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's an example, "Just like Sarah and holy women of the past."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=209s">00:03:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is actually a nice, what you call a pericope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=212s">00:03:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a nice section that you can take and say, "Hmm, there's just this nice flow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=217s">00:03:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of thought in the outline."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=219s">00:03:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the command, the punch, boom, you need to be submissive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=224s">00:03:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the supporting ideas, giving you both the rationale and the purpose, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=229s">00:03:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">means and the example of how we're to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=233s">00:03:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I was thinking about this, I could have just followed the same line of thought and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=237s">00:03:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">went through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=239s">00:03:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know how in volleyball, there's like serve, bump, set, and then spike?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=245s">00:04:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was hoping that maybe we can just kind of flip it around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=249s">00:04:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of giving you the example first, saying this is the example of how God is seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=254s">00:04:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what women should be like, and then the means by which they're going to achieve, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=259s">00:04:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera, et cetera, down to the command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=260s">00:04:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to reorder it and kind of work backwards for the section on the ladies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=266s">00:04:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's jump to verse five, verse five and six, and look at the example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=271s">00:04:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the example for you to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=275s">00:04:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "For in this way in former times, the holy women also who hoped in God used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=280s">00:04:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=284s">00:04:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, and you have become her children if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=288s">00:04:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you do what is right without being frightened by any fear."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=294s">00:04:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the example for you to follow is to be this holy woman, just as they were in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=299s">00:04:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=300s">00:05:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I were to give a sermon title for this, I would just call it Be Holy Woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=305s">00:05:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's more, there is just these running themes about what they did that will really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=310s">00:05:10.500</a></span> | <span

do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=316s">00:05:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that they hoped in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=319s">00:05:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">As an example of what you should mimic, it says that they placed their hope in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=326s">00:05:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now as we think about this, I ask this question, what does hope have to do with this command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=331s">00:05:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to submit?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=334s">00:05:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now as we think about that for a moment, how does hope relate to this command to submit?</span></div><div

Because if you have no idea what you should do, you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2329s">00:38:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a leader. Makes sense. You should be leading with full knowledge. Well, of a worldview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2337s">00:38:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you should be a, in many ways, a theologian of what God is expecting from us. Okay? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2345s">00:39:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in thinking about that a little bit, when it says for us to dwell with, with her in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2351s">00:39:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge, it is challenging us, especially as men to apply the gospel in how we are dwelling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2357s">00:39:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and living with her. What's more moving forward. It says living with her in an understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2364s">00:39:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">way as with someone weaker since she is a woman. Okay. And, uh, Oh wait, I think I kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2374s">00:39:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of messed up the order here. Sorry. Um, we're going to kind of go out of order a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2381s">00:39:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">bit in terms of, um, that section where it says weaker, we'll come back to that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2388s">00:39:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">then it says this command, show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2394s">00:39:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Putting the two commands together. One live with knowledge to show her honor. Now in showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2403s">00:40:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">an individual honor as what men should be doing, I think there's a difference between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2409s">00:40:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">just showing somebody respect as opposed to showing someone honor. Right? I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2415s">00:40:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a difference between just appreciating somebody versus showing someone honor. And I want us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2420s">00:40:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about that for a little bit. You know, what would this idea of honoring look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2425s">00:40:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like? Because truthfully speaking, we respect a lot of things, you know, for those of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2431s">00:40:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">guys play basketball, you respect referees, you know, but you don't run over and be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2436s">00:40:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">well, bam flower, you know, you did such a good job. You respect, you know, the laws</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2442s">00:40:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of the land, but you don't stop at every speed light to just be like, bow. I honor you. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2447s">00:40:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">know, we, there's a difference between just simply respecting and acknowledging something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2451s">00:40:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that's there versus honoring. And you know, what's really crazy about this is the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2457s">00:40:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for honor to show her honor is actually the same word translated precious in chapter two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2464s">00:41:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">verse seven. So earlier in chapter two, verse seven, he talked about this precious stone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2470s">00:41:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this precious stone to which to us is a huge advantage. And that word for precious is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2475s">00:41:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">same word that he uses to honor. So if there is anything fragile we've ever owned, if there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2484s">00:41:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">anything valuable, like a family heirloom, if there's something that we've moved, carried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2489s">00:41:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">up, carries an incredible amount of value, that's the way that we should treat the woman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2494s">00:41:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that treat the wives. For those of you guys who are married, there is this question. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2499s">00:41:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I was really personally convicted by this. And as I was kind of thinking, and truthfully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2504s">00:41:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking in the last, I don't know, I feel like dating back from last July, life has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2510s">00:41:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">been kind of crazy. There's just been so much going on. And in the last like month or two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2516s">00:41:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I've personally been sick and all this kind of happens. And then there's a sense to which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2522s">00:42:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, like I communicate my love to my wife. But I have to follow up a second question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2529s">00:42:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to that, which is, does she understand what I'm communicating? What I mean by that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2536s">00:42:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes as a man, you communicate your love, but then you think you're done because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2542s">00:42:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">just communicated whatever you needed to say. But then in this, when he talks about honoring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2550s">00:42:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">your wife, there's a sense to which is calling us to go above and beyond whatever we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2556s">00:42:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is just simply acceptable, to the degree where we can ask ourselves, does she understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2562s">00:42:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and get that on a human level, she is the most important, precious, valuable thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2568s">00:42:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I have? That she has the honor and the affection of my heart. And the reason why I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2576s">00:42:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">gave you my own personal kind of life example is because again, I think sometimes if let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2582s">00:43:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">say I schedule in, "Hey, I'm busy. So on Tuesday, we're going to go out. Okay." I mean, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2588s">00:43:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">guys know that's just not enough. What if I ever just said like, "Hey, we had Tuesday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2594s">00:43:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a Tuesday date night, so I'm done." That don't make any sense. We need to be constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2602s">00:43:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">pursuing, honoring, and showing as precious who they are in our lives. So I make a challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2610s">00:43:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that this passage, this call to the man, again, it's not just simply like, "Okay, guys, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2615s">00:43:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">know, you know how women are and just be understanding, whatever." But there is this even higher calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2621s">00:43:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that in the heart condition, you're seeing her as something precious. And if she is then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2627s">00:43:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">then all the various applications of what we said, seeking her best interest, taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2632s">00:43:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">responsibility for the wellbeing. This is the kind of attitude that men should have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2637s">00:43:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And for those of you who aren't married yet, think about that. If you're an individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2643s">00:44:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">who doesn't know how to respect first and foremost, and then to honor somebody, we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2649s">00:44:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn how to do that. Right? If you're a guy who's regularly given not to uplift,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2656s">00:44:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like exhort and really affirm people, but rather you're always just making fun of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2660s">00:44:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">crashing them down and breaking them, because you think that's what, you know, cool guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2665s">00:44:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever it may be do, we got to realize that's not showing what men need to be doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2671s">00:44:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and learn to do for the future. Okay. And what's more, I want to kind of wrap up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2678s">00:44:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this next two points right here. The passage talks about how, in terms of why we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2686s">00:44:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">be understanding, in terms of why we need to make sure that we're, you know, being careful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2690s">00:44:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and see somebody as precious, is that this individual is someone weaker since she is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2697s">00:44:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a woman. Right? I want to ask you this question. In what way is she weaker? Does this refer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2704s">00:45:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to only physical weakness? And again, as I studied this passage, I kind of realized like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2710s">00:45:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe the common way that people looked at this, like, yeah, you know, she can't carry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2713s">00:45:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">as much. She can't carry as many bags in the, in the whatever. She can't carry the heavy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2718s">00:45:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">trash. I don't know. Maybe that's how some people might've thought. That's just physically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2723s">00:45:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this individual happens to be weaker than men. But is that, is that what it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2730s">00:45:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">just talking about? Maybe just a physical weakness that one has? I would like to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2738s">00:45:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">again, no, that is not necessarily what it's talking about. I want to kind of highlight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2746s">00:45:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing. And I got this from the Baker commentary by Jobes. The author highlighted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2752s">00:45:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that the passage has a comparative word, weaker, not like this person is weak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2759s">00:45:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In comparison, there is a weakness, but what is this weakness? And this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2766s">00:46:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">case that I want to make. And it was important enough. I know we've kind of gone long already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2769s">00:46:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">almost a full hour, but I just want to kind of put this in here. Okay. That what we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2775s">00:46:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to realize is there is a two kinds of strengths that people need to make sure that the husband</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2780s">00:46:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and wife role operate correctly. What do I mean by this two strengths? A man needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2787s">00:46:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">have a kind of strength where he's leading and he's not stumbled by fear because he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2792s">00:46:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">so afraid he's going to mess up in his leading or he's going to mess up in X, Y, and Z. He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2797s">00:46:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">not going to do a good job and his pride is going to get hurt. And he needs to have strength</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2802s">00:46:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to overcome that. Men have a lot of fear when it comes to performance anxiety. Like I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2807s">00:46:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this, this, this, this. And if it doesn't go well and I fail, then, uh, and they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2811s">00:46:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a big fear about that. But in terms of for the ladies, there is a strength that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2816s">00:46:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">need where the role that God has called them to is one of vulnerability, right? In many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2824s">00:47:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">ways, women are placed into a role where they make themselves vulnerable because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2828s">00:47:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">making their, they've been asked to follow. They've been asked to submit by the call of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2834s">00:47:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">God, right?

So we exploit the opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2858s">00:47:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in our, in our liberty, liberty and Christian freedom and exploit that for selfishness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2863s">00:47:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">grace and mercy, which we receive free. We exploit that for selfishness. But this passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2868s">00:47:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is saying, think otherwise.

It's far more than that. Now I want to conclude by saying, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2903s">00:48:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in all of this, a big challenge for us to think through the roles that God has given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2908s">00:48:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">us and how our hope in God is challenging us to fulfill these roles. But what's more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2915s">00:48:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">he says at the very tail end of the exhortation to the husband, he says at the very end that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2922s">00:48:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we need to show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/207383830#t=2927s">00:48:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">may not be hindered.
