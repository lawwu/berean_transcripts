We pray that you would help us to love your Word and to love all of it and to have all of it be useful in guiding our lives. Help us to learn and glean from just your saints of old and help us to really seek to apply properly the various texts that we find in Scripture.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that you would help us to really engage in this hour and a half, help our brains to be extra gooey and sticky so that everything sticks, and help us just to enjoy learning your Word. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. If you guys looked at the worksheet, you'll notice there's a lot less writing to do.</p><p>It was brought to my attention in the previous worksheets, there's so much writing. I'm explaining as you're trying to write down stuff. There might be things that you miss. That was an awesome word of advice that I was given. If there are things you're like, "You know what? This is a way we can improve the study of God's Word by all means, let me know.</p><p>I'm all ears." Okay? If you'll notice, you're going to get answers ahead of time now because there aren't as many blanks. That just means you just got to engage and try to pay more close attention. I'm going to give your hands a little bit of a break from this point forward.</p><p>In between each slide, I'll try to give you additional information that I feel like would be helpful. If there are other things that you're like, "You know what? This would help if we had this." Someone came up to me and said, "Can I improve on your slides to make them more modern?" I said, "By all means, do it." We may never do this class again, so I don't know if that's going to be useful.</p><p>By all means, if there are things that you want to help us to engage better, let's do it. For you guys who came a little bit early, you noticed that Lawrence was having a tutoring session. Every week, you guys can do that just to get together and review. My encouragement is the longer you focus on this six weeks, the longer you'll be able to retain.</p><p>Try to memorize as much as you can. A lot of the memorization is going to come easy, but some of the stuff like the dates, that's only going to serve to be beneficial to you. Treat this like you're studying for a class, but it's a little easier to study for because a lot of the bigger picture things are there for you.</p><p>I'm going to briefly do this. Let's see. In your heads, what's Genesis about? In your heads. Exodus. Do you guys see pictures? Leviticus. Numbers. "Duet Run On Me." Joshua. What's a picture you see? Okay. How about judges? Right? Ruth. One Samuel. Two Samuel. What is one king about? What are two kings about?</p><p>One chronicle. Two chronicles. Ezra. Ezra. Ezra. What's that about? Nehemiah. What's that about? Then we looked at some stuff last week. Esther. And Esther is a Persian word, right? It's not even a Jewish name. Her name is Hadassah, but Esther. Job. Psalms. What animal do you see when you think of Proverbs?</p><p>That owl. Ecclesiastes. Song of Solomon. You can tell that's Solomon because he has half that heart. I say uh. Do you remember 39 and 27? That's not just Old and New Testament. 39 chapters of what? Weeping. 27 chapters of hope. Jeremiah. Judah is rotten to the core. So those are the things that we covered.</p><p>If you guys remember the distinctives of Saul, David, and Solomon, just remember bad USA, Temple City Proverbs teacher. The kings, 1, 6, 11, and 16 are king who? Reh-a-jo-jo. 1 was Reh-a-bo-um's Ab-ah's Jeh-jeh. Last week we learned, aha! The queens, Jehoash's are what? Amazing Uzis. So if I gave you time, you could probably do this on a test.</p><p>Like the kings 1 through 10 in order. And we're going to do the next five today. How do we remember the civil war to the time of Assyria? We jam in, right? War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and most of the focus is in the north. And what are the books of the Bible, the prophets that kind of fit in that time period?</p><p>Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum. And what are the two bookends that describe the destruction of Assyria? Hope and then destruction. Jonah and Nahum. That you guys remember. And you guys remember this? Cheer. Okay, what are these three blue dates? King-king split. So if I gave you a test, 10-10 stands for who becoming king.</p><p>David, how about 970? Solomon, and what happens in 930? The civil war, 10 tribes go north, two tribes go south, eventually Israel, Judah, Samaria, Benjamin, and what was the problem of the north? Golden calf worship. And then if you look at just even the geography, you have the Sea of Galilee, in the middle you have the Jordan River, and at the bottom you have the Dead Sea.</p><p>What are these? A, B, C, D. Okay? And we learned last week a little cheer. Split two, seven, two, two, split two, seven, two, two. We're gonna learn the other three in a poem, authored by me this week. And then we have the Medo-Persians, the returns, and 333. Some people say 331, I just put 333 'cause it's easier to remember.</p><p>Okay, and that's the Greeks. And then you have the time of Jesus. And we remembered, we jamen is how we remember that little section. Between the split and Assyria, we are jamen, war, Elijah, Assyria, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, and Nahum. Today we're gonna learn a poem, okay? So I'm gonna go slow and I'm gonna say it a few times and then try to remember it.</p><p>So you're not writing anything down, so just try to memorize it, okay? Look up, don't look at the poem yet, okay? Just try to think logically. Six, 12, Assyria's shelved. You guys got that? Six, 12, Assyria's shelved. What's shelved mean? It's gone, right? Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.</p><p>Logically do you guys, is this easy to track? Okay. Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow. What year did Babylon conquer Assyria? 612, okay? And who did they conquer? Assyria. What book prophecies 612, you think? Nahum does, okay? Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, and then what happens? Judah soon to follow, 586, the temple's nixed.</p><p>So what happens in 586? Temple's gone. And then who laments and wallows? Jeremiah laments and wallows. Do you think Jeremiah and lamentations are about the temple? Okay, now you know, okay? Here we go. Close your eyes. Six, 12, what's the next line? Assyria's shelved, and who is soon to follow?</p><p>Judah soon to follow, 586. What's nixed? Temple's nixed. Jeremiah laments and wallows. Okay? We'll do the whole poem about three times. Here we go. Try to do it without looking. Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow. 586, temple's nixed. Jeremiah laments and wallows. Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.</p><p>586, temple's nixed. Jeremiah laments and wallows. Last time. Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow. 586, temple's nixed. Jeremiah laments and wallows. So six, 12, Assyria's shelved, and Judah is soon to follow. Here it says, in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</p><p>That's actually how Daniel starts. And that's also how Jeremiah ends in the 50s, okay? Chapter like 52, okay? And when Judah gets shelved also, you end up with 70 years of captivity, okay? And what is that cap- what's the C? A, B, C, what's a C? That's the captivity, okay?</p><p>So the 70 years of a captivity, why did they happen? Because every seven years, the people were supposed to let the land rest. Did they obey it? No, they didn't obey it at all. So they didn't obey it for about 490 years. They said, "Oh, it's just too ideal.</p><p>It's not practical. God's law and word is just for ideal standards and good situations. We don't really need to obey this." So 490 years, the land never rested. So God says, "You're gonna pay this land back. You're gonna take 70 years. You're gonna be away from the land. So it's gonna just be wild, okay?" And so the 70 years are actually measured in two ways, and it's on your paper.</p><p>You can either measure it from the first exile in Babylon to the arrival back to the land. Or 5, 8, 6 temples next, that destruction, and then the second temple is actually completed. What book of the Bible talks about the second temple being completed? Ezra, okay? So the second temple is completed.</p><p>So 612, Assyrias shelved, Judah soon to follow. So when you're thinking Judah soon to follow, think the sea, okay? And 70 years of people being taken in three waves back to Babylon. Babylon had a habit of taking the best and brightest of every country that they conquered, the best looking, the smartest, and they wanted to train them up as Babylonians so that later, Babylonian empire can just be everywhere.</p><p>And amongst those, among them, four of those guys we know about, Daniel, Azariah, Mishael, Hananiah, who are those guys? We know them by their Persian name or Babylonian names. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, okay? So Daniel, Mishael, Azariah, Hananiah, those guys are the Jews that were amongst those taken captive during these 70 years, okay?</p><p>How many of you guys have lived 70 years ago? How old were you guys? I know Dr. Peng just was born, okay? So 70 years is a long time. That's like three or four generations. And remember, Jews got married in their teens. So possibly even five generations were just during captivity, okay?</p><p>So one more time with the poem. Six, 12, Assyrias shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows. So what's this 586, temples nixed? That one's easy. We'll learn next week why this happened, okay? But basically the last king of Judah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. Actually, I'll just tell you now.</p><p>Zedekiah was like a 20, no, no, he was like a 30-year-old king, okay? So he thought, ooh, we shall overcome. So let's fight back against Nebuchadnezzar. So he does that. Nebuchadnezzar in a rage destroys the temple. And then Zedekiah's children, it says his sons are slaughtered before his eyes.</p><p>So Zedekiah's tied up looking at his sons being slaughtered, and then he gets his eyes gouged out. And that's the last thing Zedekiah sees is all of his chief leaders and his sons being slaughtered in front of his eyes. Zedekiah was 30. How old were his kids? They're not grown kids.</p><p>So Zedekiah actually has to watch his little children just being crushed and like slain and slaughtered in the cruelest of ways, and then that's the last thing he sees. And that's 586 is a horrible time. So Jeremiah probably was there to witness all this. So he's saying the king's whole family just got slaughtered, these beautiful children.</p><p>What sin did they commit? They got slaughtered. This temple is destroyed. So he's lamenting. So Jeremiah laments and wallows. What is he lamenting? There are two things. The book of Jeremiah is about what? Rottenness of Judah we looked at last week. And it's like a dirty waistband that he purchased that just went rotten.</p><p>But what is it that he laments? The book of Lamentations is about weeping over Judah's losses. I'm going to read chapter 1, verse 1 for you, Lamentations 1.1. How lovely sits the city that was once full of people. She has become like a widow who was once great among the nations.</p><p>She who was a princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer. So he's weeping over the fact that Jerusalem is now empty. Because guess what happened to all the people? They either got killed or they got taken away. So it's kind of like the hustle and bustle of Manhattan.</p><p>Literally just being wiped out. And all you've got left over are animals and homeless people. And just people like scavenging for stuff. So that's what he saw. Lamentations 3.22. The Lord's loving kindness indeed never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. His compassions never fail. They are new every morning.</p><p>What's the next verse? New every morning. Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord. That's Lamentations 3. So he's actually sitting there in front of this ruined city lamenting, but he's also hoping in God. So the next time you sing like this, steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end.</p><p>They are new every morning. You sing that, you've got to remember the context. This is at the worst moment in their history. Nice. Someone's hanging out upstairs. So Lamentations is about what? Weeping over Judah's losses. 6.12. Assyria is shelved. Judah soon to follow. 5.8.6. Saul's next. Jeremiah laments and wallows.</p><p>So what lesson did they finally learn? So what is it now that the people of Judah finally got to understand? That idolatry is a flaw. What did they have taken away because of the hundreds of years of idolatry? They lost their freedom. They lost their land. They lost their power, their armies, their weapons.</p><p>They weren't even allowed to carry weapons by the time you get to the New Testament. You guys notice that? Just maybe a sword or a knife. And they lost all their wealth. So freedom, they are now slaves. First in Babylon and then what country? Persia. They don't have a country anymore except for a brief period where in the Maccabean revolution they got their land back.</p><p>That's why they celebrate. You know Hanukkah? The Jewish holiday? That's what the celebration is about. Hanukkah is not necessarily in scripture. But they are celebrating that time of freedom where they finally got their land back. But they lost it again. So between Malachi and Matthew they got their land back and they lost it again.</p><p>And they don't get their land back until 1945. So for almost 2,000 years, over 2,000 years, Israel has no country. What happened in 1945? Israel came back on the map. Which is a miracle. Because people don't disappear for 2,000 years and then a country is formed again. You guys following me?</p><p>This is important because we are going to look at Ezekiel today. So for 2,000 years they had no land. People's theology changed. You know most of the church before World War II, everybody was a Presbyterian. They believed there was no plan for Israel. But after Israel showed up on the scene, I'm putting it very simply, but when Israel showed up on the scene, everybody's theology got all jacked up.</p><p>You know why? Wait a minute. Is God fulfilling all of these Old Testament prophecies to Israel again? Because for 2,000 years, everything was spiritualized. Not just as you guys are following this. So they lost their freedom, they lost their land, they lost their masses of armies. Who was known for their armies?</p><p>USA. David, they lost all that and they lost their wealth. And now they're having to pay what little money they have to like Caesar. And this is so sad. So imagine the United States of America 200 years from now, every single one of our descendants who's living here is a slave.</p><p>That's the equivalent. So you guys tracking along? One more time with the poem. 6, 12. Assyria is shelved. Judah soon to follow. 5, 8, 6. Temples nixed. Jeremiah laments and swallows. Now we're at... What did I say? Wallows. Jeremiah laments and wallows. Now we're looking at the BCD. Okay?</p><p>A, B, King, King split. A, B, C, D. Medo, Persians, return and Greeks. King, King split. A, B, C, D. Medo, Persians, return and Greeks. You could probably do the timeline now if I gave you time, right? King, what year? 1010. King, 970. Split. 930. When did Saul become king?</p><p>1050, because 42, 40, 40. Right? Okay? So King, King split. A is when? Split, two, 722, split, two. What year? 722. When's B? 612. Assyria is shelved. What's C? That period in between. It starts to happen. 600-ish, right? When's D? 586. Okay? So now you have seven of those dates.</p><p>There's a way to remember that. Now, the B, C, D all happens at once, so I'm going to use it conveniently. Hey, don't take a picture of this, because I might get sued, right? But you guys know this sign, right? Most of you, if you guys are Asian, you might know this.</p><p>It's the sign for the Greek. It's the Greek. And it's the sign for the Greek. So it's the Greek. So it's the Greek. It's the Greek. So it's the Greek. And it's the Greek. And it's the Greek. So it's the Greek. Now, how do you know that? I'm going to use this.</p><p>It's the Greek. So it's the Greek. So it's the Greek. So it's the Greek. What does that stand for, Temple, Sadie, Proverbs, teacher. So, it's an acronym, and another way to say acronym is HEADS. So, what books? Remember, we JAMN, but with BCD, what should you remember? The HEADS of these four books, and + Jeremiah Lamentations.</p><p>First book, Habakkuk, second one, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah, and they're not necessarily in order. Okay, so when I'm, the we JAMN is pretty much in order. These HEADS are similar in time, not necessarily similar in order. So, HEADS, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah, but there's a bunch of H books and Z books, right?</p><p>There's also Zachariah, there's Haggai, there's Hosea. So how do you remember which H this is, and which Z this is? I'll give you a little hint. What's that? It's a sundubu, right? Is it spicy or not spicy? It's botong. This is a spicy one. If you can't handle the heat, and you start eating this stuff, what happens to your body?</p><p>And then usually that restaurant is enclosed, so you start getting sweaty, okay? What gets sweaty? Your back gets sweaty. Habakkuk, okay? So what happens when your back gets sweaty? What do you need to do yourself? Fan. I don't know how else to remember it. Just use my tools, okay?</p><p>So does it make sense? Does this help? Yes, it does. Okay, so just remember it this way. 6, 12, Assyria is shelved. Judah soon to follow. What's the next date? 586. Temples nixed. Jeremiah laments and wallows. So for the BCD period, there are actually 6 books that you need to remember.</p><p>What are those 6? Jeremiah lamentations, and then these heads, okay? Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah? No. What's that Z book? Zephaniah, okay? So just remember it this way. Then we're going to cover some of these books, and then after some of these books, we'll take a little bit of a break.</p><p>This is Ezekiel, all right? So Ezekiel, if you just look at him, he's a skeleton with an easy towel. And this is the dry bones will come to life is the thing that is focused on here, okay? In Ezekiel chapter 37, God says, "Prophesy, son of man, come to life, dead dry bones." So these bones that had been buried for a long time, and dry bones are bones that are like literally...</p><p>Is that thunder or is that someone up there? Oh, that's crazy. Nice. Okay. So whoever's watching the video is going to be like, "What's going on?" What was I talking about? Ezekiel, the dry bones. Okay, Ezekiel 37. So he asks, "Can these dry bones come to life?" And Ezekiel says, "No." When I was in college, I went to Berkeley and we had a little pier at the Berkeley Marina, and then we went fishing, my friend and I, we went fishing.</p><p>And I ended up pulling up a five-foot shark, okay? A seven-gill shark. It was five feet. And then we decided to try to eat it. I almost died after I ate it because it was toxic. But he took the head home, okay? He took the head home and then he left it actually in a bag in the garage of the apartment building.</p><p>And it just... And then he went down there having forgotten about this shark head because what he wanted was the teeth. So he had just left it there because we spent all night fishing and then he... Like a week later, he actually went to the shark head and it was nasty.</p><p>It smelled so bad. So eventually, because he wanted the teeth, he cleaned it off and then he boiled it to get all the meat off. So he ended up with the skull of the shark. Now that shark skeleton now, even more so, it's even deader now, right? This was back in 1998, but now it's been 20 plus years.</p><p>If we try to reconstruct this shark with these jaw bones, would that work? No, it's an impossible thing. But in the book of Ezekiel, God is saying, "I am going to raise up these dry bones. They're gonna be a powerful army and they are going to be instruments in my hands." Immediate context, that happens.</p><p>But the nation of Israel itself is described in the book of Ezekiel. Israel coming back in 1945 should never have happened. That's an impossible thing, that they would become a country again. So Ezekiel is about dry bones coming back to life. And that's why Ezekiel is hard to understand because there's so many different prophecies going on about immediate context and the end times.</p><p>So Ezekiel is about dry bones coming to life. What's lamentation is about? Grieving and weeping over Judah's losses. And what did they lose? Freedom? Law, flaw. Land? Arms? Wealth. They lost everything. So if you go to the New Testament, are the Jews idol-phobic or idol lovers? They hate idols.</p><p>Did you ever think about that? In the Old Testament, they're like always getting in trouble because they're dancing around idols and stuff. In the New Testament, they're so strict. What happened? They learned their lesson finally. Okay, that's lamentations. Ezekiel is about dry bones coming to life. Daniel. If you look at the picture, this Daniel in the lion's den, it's one easy way to remember.</p><p>And this whole book really is about dreams and visions. Dreams and visions. Ezekiel was about dry bones coming back to life, which is a description of what he's going to do in the New Testament to all Christians because he's going to give us, take away our heart of what?</p><p>Stone, and put in our hearts a heart of? Flesh. He's going to put a new spirit in us. And it also says in Jeremiah. But in context of the nation of the people of God, they're going to come back to life. Daniel is about dreams and visions. And what are these visions?</p><p>So this picture is different from the one that I put it on the paper for you, and I did that on purpose. But it has basically the same thing. Slightly different wording. So Daniel 2.1, in the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams. His mind was troubled, and he could not sleep.</p><p>So and he dreams a bit of this statue that has a head of gold. He has a chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, feet of iron and clay, and a little rock comes and destroys this statue. And these all stand for something.</p><p>On your paper, it'll say that the head of gold is Babylon. What's the chest and arms of silver? The Medo-Persian alliance that comes and knocks out Babylon. Belly and thighs of bronze, ancient Greeks. Legs of iron. Did you guys know Rome was actually known for their iron? Legs of iron, what is that?</p><p>It should be all on your paper. That's Rome. Legs of iron and clay also revitalized Rome. Some people think that has to do with the Roman church in the early period. Some people say it's Europe. But either way, the feet of iron and clay is debated. But this little rock that comes and knocks everything down is the kingdom of God.</p><p>Daniel has a vision, you guys still looking at it? It should be very similar to what's on that picture. If you just Google this, you'll find these images. You'll find all kinds of different images. So I got this from Google. I'm moving on. And then in chapter 7, Daniel has a vision.</p><p>So in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, this is many, many years later. This is after King Nebuchadnezzar goes crazy. But Belshazzar, his great grandson, Daniel had a dream. And visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. And he wrote down the substance of his dreams.</p><p>So it was about 40 years later. Belshazzar has a vision. Okay, that animation was kind of lame. But he has a vision of these four creatures. Same concept. Lying with wings. Babylon. Okay? The bear is twisted at one side. Where one side is more dominant and stronger than the other.</p><p>The Medo-Persian alliance, you end up actually hearing more about Persia than Mede. Right? Because before we learned the king-king split here, Medo-Persia, what is that? Okay? Persia is what you know. But the Medes were there to help the Persian empire knock out Babylon. But it's a little bit of a lopsided bear.</p><p>Okay? And then the leopard is Greece. And then that beast is Rome. So in your Bibles, a lot of times, if there's a little title section, it'll usually just say the Babylonian empire in the visions. Nod your heads if you guys have noticed that before. Yeah? And then a third vision that Daniel sees is Daniel chapter 7, verses 13 to 14.</p><p>And on your paper, I actually wrote the verses out. It's basically he sees a vision of heaven, and the son of man, who is what Jesus always calls himself in the New Testament, son of God, son of man, this is second Adam, he comes and he sees this son of man getting all the authority from God the Father.</p><p>And that's the vision that he sees. So those are the three main contextual visions that you have in the book of Daniel. But then chapters 6 through 12 in the book of Daniel are crazy, because it's all about the book of...or the end times. Lamentations, what is that book about?</p><p>Losses and mourning the losses of Judah. And what were those losses? Freedom, land, arms, wealth. What's Ezekiel about? Dry bones coming back to life, an impossible feat. What is Daniel about? This is the last major prophet. What's Daniel about? Dreams and visions. And the three visions are the statue, beasts, son of man.</p><p>Got it? So what we've done, 5-12, 5-5-12, 5-12, 5-5-12. We haven't heard this in a while, right? It's been a whole one week, okay? 5-12, 5-5-12. So you have the Pentateuch, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st and 2nd, Samuel, 1st Kings, 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther.</p><p>And then last week we covered the poems, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Solomon. And there are four major prophets, but we stick Lamentations in there to make it five. Isaiah, Jeremiah, and today Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, but we'll get there, okay? So, so far what we covered today, 6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows, and what are the six prophecies that are about BCD?</p><p>Not just four, but includes Jeremiah Lamentations. Jeremiah Lamentations, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah. Got it? And what did Jeremiah lament in Lamentations? The loss of everything. And what caused those losses? And they lost fame, paying attention to some people. Some of you guys looked so mad. No, freedom, land, arms, wealth, everything that is at all valuable or priceless, they lost.</p><p>But Ezekiel says, the impossible is gonna happen, you're gonna gain it all back, right? Just as much as it's impossible for dry bones to come back to life, Israel's gonna stand again, according to one theological perspective, okay? Our church believes that God still has a plan for the nation of Israel, okay?</p><p>So the debates a lot of times are out of texts from Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation, and Romans 9-11. So those are things that, just to be aware of. Ezekiel, the valley of dry bones, they're gonna rise up again. Daniel, Lamentations, Ezekiel. What's Daniel about? Dreams and visions about the context in their immediate future context, as well as the kingdom of God that is to come.</p><p>Those three visions are Nebuchadnezzar's first vision is about the golden...or the statue, okay? Israel, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome. And you actually see all of those in the Old and New Testament together, do we not? You see the statue, Daniel sees a vision of the four beasts, and then the Son of Man, who is also that little rock that comes and crumbles everything.</p><p>So next time you read the book of Daniel, and you're like, "Dude, chapters 1-3 are awesome 'cause these are stories I'm familiar with," and then later when he's an old man, he gets thrown into the lion's den, great! But what is all this other stuff of these visions and things?</p><p>Now you know, okay? Some of it is still yet future, all right? So one more time, 6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows. Who else laments and wallows a little bit? Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah. Who's jamming? We are, right? Okay. War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, Jonah, Nahum are about who?</p><p>The destruction of? A. BCD, Babylon, captivity, destruction of the temple. How many years were they captive? 70, because they didn't let the land rest for 490 years. Bokchang-dong, right? Those are heads, okay? Now you remember, Jeremiah lamentations, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah. 6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows.</p><p>Let's take a little time to just do a little review with each other. Now we're doing like test style, okay? Find a partner, review, and then we'll take a break till about 11.25. Find a partner.</p></div></body></html>
