After the service, please do join us at our welcome booth. You probably saw the blue canopy out there in the parking lot. We'd love to meet you and answer any questions that you may have.</p><p>We also had a couple important announcements for today. For anybody looking to serve in the children's ministry over the summer and also into the next school year, if you have not been child safety trained, you have to be in order to serve, and there's going to be two sessions in which you can get that training done.</p><p>One is happening today here in the main sanctuary at 1.30 p.m. You can just jump right in if you didn't sign up ahead of time, and then if you're not able to make it, there is the makeup session on July 7th, again, here in the sanctuary, okay? So please mark your calendar for that.</p><p>As you know, for Friday the 28th, we're gonna be having our all-church praise and prayer, so let's come together and pray corporately. That starts at 7.30, so please mark your calendar for that as well. Couple ministry-related, for those parents who wanted to sign their children up for the VBS that's taking place July 15th through the 19th, today is the last day to sign up, so remember to sign up for that.</p><p>You can go on our website and do that directly. For the family ministry, there's going to be a beach fellowship day on July 20th, which is a Saturday from 10 to 2 p.m. That'll be taking place on Bolsa Chica State Beach. It is a bring-your-own lunch, bring-your-own fun games, etc.</p><p>Please come out. We'd love to connect with people and get to know each other, so sign up for that so we can get a head count, and we'd love to see you there. The last note is we have been announcing it, but we do need to get our final registrations in for our family retreat.</p><p>We are at about 95% capacity, so if you wanted to come to the family retreat, it's taking place August 16th through the 18th, please be sure to register for that, okay? At this time, we'll take a moment to pray for our offering. If you brought a physical check, the offering box is there by the entrance.</p><p>Otherwise, we can submit it digitally. Let's pray. Our Heavenly Father, we always thank you, God. We're so grateful to you. And when we consider our lives, you have been so merciful. God, you have been so generous and kind. And Lord, we want to thank you from our hearts, and we pray that everything about this worship expresses to you just how thankful we are.</p><p>God, from the songs that we sing to the time that we devote here, may the worship rise to you, knowing, God, that you deserve it all. And Lord, also we pray for the offering, that it is a continuation of the worship we give. We ask that, God, you would continue to use it to build your kingdom, your church.</p><p>And Lord, we pray that our community would so grow in faith. We ask, God, that you would bless our time this morning, and say in Christ's name we pray, amen.
