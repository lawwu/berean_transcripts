Just to kind of give you a heads up, next Sunday we have our communion service that's happening, so please come prepared for that. Our next child safety training. If you are working with children at our church in any capacity, this is a mandatory training, so if you haven't signed up for that, it's happening next Sunday at 1.30 at the youth chapel, so please sign up for that.</p><p>Next Sunday is the beginning of the college study hall, so you guys are already at the end of the quarter, and so if you want to bring snacks or anything to kind of encourage our college students to focus on their studies, you can just bring it and then drop it off in the cafe area, and so that'll be helpful to them.</p><p>Again, so that's starting next Sunday at 6 p.m., and then I am told that the VBS sign-up closes tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. So if you are planning to bring your child to the VBS, I think there is a sign-up table outside so you can go visit it and then sign up or you can do it online, but the registration is closing tomorrow, so if you haven't done so, we encourage you to do that as soon as possible.</p><p>Then, as I mentioned last week, our lot behind us is officially closed, so if you park there today, you're parking at your own risk, but officially that lot is going to be closed for the time being, and so because of that, our Alliant parking lot, our parking lot here, our cafe area, and then the parking to the left of us, that spot has about 20 spots, so that's going to be reserved for families with small children, and so please park there, and then otherwise you can kind of park in other areas, so please reserve that for the young families so that they don't have to walk on the streets or wait for the shuttle.</p><p>So please remember that lot for the time being, unless we figure something out with them, have conversation, and we're able to open that lot up so that back lot is going to be officially closed. The lot that we have in lot G, if you look at the map, you have H and G.</p><p>The G lot was where a bulk of our parking was happening, and I'm assuming some of you may have done that, but the lot G for temporary, and this is just for the time being, will be closed on Sunday, so if we have weekday activity or Friday night praise and prayer, that lot will be open, but for now, Sunday, lot G is going to be closed, and we're asking most of you to go to lot J, okay?</p><p>So if you're going to be shuttled, lot J is where you would want to go, and so it's a huge parking lot, and that's where our shuttle is going to be making the rotation to come around, pick you up, and so maybe some of you guys have already done that.</p><p>Again, so lot G, until further notice, try not to park there, and then there will be shuttle that is coming to lot H if you do need to, but because there's going to be smaller number there, the shuttle is not going to be rotating that frequently, but the larger part of the shuttles are going to be going to lot J, okay?</p><p>And there's plenty of parking there, so please keep that in mind, and I think that's all I have for today. And let me pray for the offering, and then after the pray set, our sister Jasmine is going to come up and give her testimony and be baptized this morning.</p><p>All right, let's pray. Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come before your throne to worship you and give you thanks, Lord God, for all that you've given. Help us to fix our eyes upon Christ that our worship that we give you will truly be sincerely from our hearts.</p><p>We pray that all that we are doing this morning will be a pleasing aroma to you, that even this giving that we give may it be an act of worship, may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold, and to be handled wisely, Lord God, for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. (soft piano music) As we stand for worship, let's just take a moment to greet those around us. (soft piano music) (upbeat music) Strengthen our eyes as we pray.

I grew up going to church, attending every Friday and Sunday. Even though I heard the word every Friday and Sunday, I never understood why it should matter. As the years passed, I continued to think of ways to get out of hearing about the word.</p><p>When I was 11 years old, I was selected to be part of a group of kids that would play instruments and sing on Sunday to the kids. I saw this as an excuse to hang out with my friends and never understood the depth of what I was doing and the offense it was to the Lord.</p><p>Almost every Sunday, I would stand on the stage and sing songs towards the Lord, but all the while, my heart would just continue to harden. Towards the end of my eighth grade, my family hit a rough patch and decided to leave the church we were attending. At the time, I had gotten angry at God and questioned if he was so good, why were so many bad things happening in my life?</p><p>At the end of my freshman year, COVID started, and suddenly I went from interacting with people who I got my validation from to being stuck in a room which I shared with my sister. In my time of being alone, I started to see how the people I had chosen to surround myself were having a bad influence on me.</p><p>I had started cursing and finding pleasure in the lust that the world held to provide. After I came to the realization, I decided to distance myself from them. As as days passed, I felt as though I was in an endless cycle of scrolling through the apps on my phone but never finding any true joy in it.</p><p>During this time, the sister I shared a room with had started Bible study at Berean via Zoom. I noticed that while I was struggling mentally, she seemed happier and started wondering what she knew that I didn't. Towards the beginning of my junior year, I started attending the youth group at Berean.</p><p>During this time, I was truly hearing for the first time about how much of a sinner I was and how there is a God whose love was so great that he would send his only son to die for our sins. It was then that the Holy Spirit had started to warm my heart, but still my heart wanted to hold on to what the world could give me.</p><p>During my senior year of high school, I was continuing to pray that the Lord would give life to my heart all the while rendering my heart. During my freshman year of college, God revealed to me that I had tricked myself into thinking that if I tried hard enough, I would be able to stop myself from sinning, and only then would I be able to come before God in true repentance.</p><p>Towards the end of my freshman year of college, I was going through Romans with a classmate. Romans 3, 23-24 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ." Jesus had me in tears because I was overcome with these feelings of gratitude and love.</p><p>And through it all, it finally clicked that only God had the power to forgive me and wash my sins away, that nothing I do could save me and all my tries would be meaningless because I'm such a wretched sinner and I have no strength to do otherwise. That night, I came before the Lord asking for forgiveness in true repentance, declaring him as my Lord and Savior, and praying for his will to be done, not mine.</p><p>Now, as I continue to wrestle with sin, I know that I am redeemed because he is my Savior who has defeated all sin. Thank you. >> All right, thank you, Yasmin, for that encouraging testimony. This morning, as you can see by the way that I'm dressed, I'm not speaking.</p><p>If you are a member of the church, you probably got an email and you saw the post on our Facebook page that we have a new pastor that's joining our family. And he's not new to us as far as our community is concerned because he's spoken at our church many times.</p><p>If I can ask them to come and they're going to see--so you can at least see who I'm talking about. All right, so Pastor Sung and his wife, Becky. Yeah, you can clap for them. Yeah. So as you guys know, Pastor Sung has spoken at our church many times.</p><p>He gave his testimony and our Good Friday sermon, I think about three to four years ago. And then he's spoken at our FAM 245. He's spoken at our men's conferencing, the searchlight. And so I know many of you are already very familiar with him. And again, you'll get to read about his--I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but you'll get to know him better.</p><p>He is going to be serving in our college department. And so, again, all the details of his background, I'm sure you'll find out more. But we're very excited to welcome him. Becky, his wife, actually was an old-time member of our church. She came to our church when she was a sophomore junior in college.</p><p>And then she was with us, I forgot, 15-plus years, right? She was with us for a long time. And then when we were very active in China, she was out there representing us in China for about eight months. And then she also, you know, early on when we went to Romania, so she was on that trip as well.</p><p>She was a very integral part of our church when our church was much smaller. And then about eight years ago, they met. And then Becky asked me to go and check this guy out, you know, to make sure that he's legit. And so I remember meeting him for the first time, coming back, encouraged.</p><p>Sounds like you met a genuine believer in Christ who's going to serve together. And so we were saddened, obviously, you know, after they got married. They said goodbye to Becky, but it was not God's will for them to be away for long, okay? So they're -- again, so even though they're new as an official, officially new today, they've actually been a part of our church kind of in and out for a while.</p><p>So I'm sure many of you are familiar. And they've been attending our church, just even just attending for the last month or so. And so, again, I just want to introduce you to them, and then you'll have plenty of time to get to know them better. Because today is the first official day that they're being announced.</p><p>I wanted to introduce you to them. So let's give them a warm welcome. Then Pastor Sung's going to come and deliver the message. >> Again, thank you, Pastor Peter, for that introduction. That's the second time he had to do that today. And then we're looking for the third one.</p><p>Before we open our text, I want to thank all of you for welcoming me and my wife, Becky, with open arms. I want to thank the Berean leadership for giving me an opportunity to serve Berean Community Church as an undershepherd of Jesus Christ. For many of you who are not familiar with me, I would like to formally introduce myself to you.</p><p>As Pastor Peter had mentioned, my name is Sung. I've been an ordained minister since 2018. I'm married to my wonderful wife, Becky, who is not here now. She left. But we had the joy of having two beautiful sons, Matthew and Amos, who, according to the sovereign purpose of our God, have gone before us to be with the Lord.</p><p>And we are eagerly waiting and hope to see them again in glory. My wife, Becky, as Pastor Peter had mentioned, was a member of Berean Community Church since 2000s until I wooed her and I took her away from the community that she so loved. But I've learned over the years that though you take the girl out of Berean, you can never take Berean out of the girl.</p><p>Berean is very near and dear to my wife's heart. This is her home church. And she made mention of that to me several times. But I'm very happy that this is her home church, and now it has become mine. Berean had a tremendous impact on Becky and on her spiritual development.</p><p>You know, the valuable lessons that she had learned here actually played an important part in her transition from a pastor's wife. And today, I've been an undeserving beneficiary of all her efforts since. And even though Becky left Berean in 2017, we remain connected to Berean through many relationships that she had established over the 13-plus years that she's been here.</p><p>And as a result, I was able to establish relationships with many of the brothers and sisters here at Berean who I consider as family today. Prior to Berean, I had been involved with various Christian ministries since 2010. I was a lead pastor of a church plant for a few years until we had to close the church in 2024 due to unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>But like Pastor Peter said, God led us back to Berean to worship Him and to be equipped with His Word. And we are very happy to be a part of a faithful community that honors God in worship, holds to the authority of the Holy Scriptures, and sincerely has a burden for the lost.</p><p>And so I'm tremendously blessed to be a part of this faithful community that welcomed us, and I really look forward to serving all of you in the many days to come. Having said that, I want to invite you to turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 5.</p><p>1 Peter chapter 5, and we're reading verses 1 and 4 this morning, and I've titled our morning's message "An Exhortation to Spiritual Leaders." And these are the inspired words of the Lord. "Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, "as your fellow elder and witness "of the sufferings of Christ "and a partaker also of the glory "that is to be revealed, "shepherd the flock of God among you, "exercising oversight, "not under compulsion, but voluntarily, "according to the will of God "and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness, "nor yet as lording it over those "who are loaded to your charge, "but proving to be examples to the flock.</p><p>"And when the chief shepherd appears, "you will receive the unfading crown of glory." Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, thank you for allowing me to have this honor of sharing the word with your people this morning. And as I do this introspection, I do pray that you would convict and challenge me to remind me of the task that is at hand and to serve faithfully.</p><p>And I pray for all of us that you would give us ears to hear and help us, Lord, to practice the things that we have heard so that we are not deceiving ourselves. So thank you again for this time and we pray this in the name of our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ.</p><p>Amen. Amen. As you know, the church is in need of faithful leaders, not just in times of hardship and persecution, but especially in times of prosperity and ease. And unfortunately, the current climate of Western Christianity has generated some unfaithful men to occupy the pulpit. And because there are unfaithful men who occupy the pulpit with little to no accountability, these men hurt the reputation of the church and its members with their moral failures.</p><p>And as Prophet Nathan told David when confronting him of his sin with Bathsheba, unfaithful men in leadership are often called names. Just in the previous year, several well-known pastors shocked the evangelical world with their sins, bringing reproach not only to themselves but to the message that they proclaim. And because of the spiritual abuse of some pastors, many Christians have been hurt and are left asking the question, "What is going on?" And so what I want to do today is place a mirror in the direction of the pulpit for some introspection and what we are to expect from pastors called to the ministry.</p><p>And so I humbly ask that you bear with me as I place myself front and center for your analysis. In the opening four verses of Chapter 5, Peter directs his exhortation to leaders in the church and he urges them to fulfill their spiritual responsibility by faithfully shepherding the Lord's flock.</p><p>We know that the Lord's flock is on purpose. You see, it is not a coincidence that the Word of God uses an analogy of sheep to describe Christ's followers. And not to offend anyone here this morning, but we share some similar traits with sheep. Without getting into all the details, sheep depend their lives on shepherds.</p><p>And a shepherd must continually do what is necessary. Sheep have great dependence on shepherds. A shepherd who is careful, a shepherd who is thoughtful, a shepherd who is watchful and knowledgeable, a shepherd who plans, a shepherd who provides, and a shepherd who protects his sheep. And this is because sheep without a shepherd are just vulnerable creatures that face extreme danger in the wilderness.</p><p>Sheep without a shepherd face extreme danger. And this is why a shepherd must continually be on guard and defend and rescue sheep. They must guide them from going astray, lead them to green pastures and still waters, and protect them from predators looking for an easy meal. And Peter understood the spiritual analogy of a shepherd.</p><p>A shepherd must guide his sheep to green pastures to shepherd them. Since believers like sheep are prone to wander, indiscriminately take in what is bad, often become unclean, are highly vulnerable and defenseless on their own, the demand for faithful shepherds are high. And so in these opening verses is the first word of exhortation to all the elders in the church.</p><p>And the first exhortation is this, "Shepherd the flock of God." Peter said it more specifically in verse 2, "Shepherd the flock of God among you." Now the key word here is shepherd. Peter, who is a fellow elder himself, is asking other elders to shepherd the flock of God. And you know, the responsibility of a shepherd is very serious.</p><p>In Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17, "Obey your leaders and submit to them." Why? Because they keep watch over your souls as those who will have to give an account. And when we look at this passage, there are two sides to the command in Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17. The immediate command is to the congregation to come away from myself and place it towards you.</p><p>And I want to briefly talk about the congregation's responsibility to its pastors. And it's simple. When a pastor is in the will of God, teaching the Word of God, and he is faithful, the people of God should obey and submit to his leadership. When a pastor is overseeing the church with love and humility, those under his leadership should submit in love and humility.</p><p>We should, as the Word of God commands in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 12 and 13, "Appreciate those who diligently labor among you and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work." They are serving and laboring faithfully among us.</p><p>In the Old Testament, the Lord rebuked Israel for not heeding the words of the prophets he had sent to them. And this is what he said. He said to them in Jeremiah chapter 26 verses 4 through 5, "If you will not listen to me to walk in my law which I have set before you to listen to the words of the Lord.</p><p>These are the words from the Lord regarding his faithful servants that the people have refused to listen to. God communicated with his people with the agents of prophets in the Old Testament and because the people refused to listen to the Lord's prophets when he sent to them again and again." In that following passage he says to you this morning is this, "Do not repeat the mistake of Israel.</p><p>Submit to spiritual leaders who are faithful, who have been divinely appointed to shepherd your souls and let them serve with joy because this will be beneficial for you." And the second aspect of the command, though implied, is for pastors to keep watch and when you think about the responsibility of overseeing not just the temporal but the immortal souls of man that is a tremendous task.</p><p>A task that often compels pastors to stay up at night with intercession and supplication meditating on the scripture in order to present to his congregation the words of God that pertains to life and godliness. And this brings us back to the subject of shepherding and I'm going to reposition this metaphorical mirror back to myself so you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>I didn't go too far. But I want to say that pastors are ultimately accountable to God. Pastors are given oversight of the Lord's church and we are responsible to shepherd his people. The objective of shepherding is to care for the sheep and one of the main ways in which shepherds care for their sheep is to provide them with good food.</p><p>Faithful pastors give to his congregation the words of God which is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training in righteousness that you may be adequately equipped for every good work. And this is why one of the qualifications of a pastor mentioned in 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 2 is that he must be a skillful teacher and he must be prepared to teach the word of God even when the word of God is rejected by men.</p><p>One of the main responsibilities of a shepherd is to feed the flock of God. Yes, shepherds must protect. We must have oversight to keep the flock together but the way in which pastors can do this is to lead the people of God with the inspired words of God. Peter understood this assignment because when he was forgiven by the Lord and recommissioned to the work of an apostle Jesus commanded him and said in John chapter 21 and I'm just going to summarize this for time's sake.</p><p>He said to Peter, Peter since you love me I want you to take care of my sheep and tend to them. And the word tend can also be translated as feed. Peter was commanded to feed the flock of God and what is it that the Lord the God that pertains everything to life and godliness and that is exactly what Peter is expressing in our present passage.</p><p>The things which he had heard the things which he had seen from the Lord is now being passed on to spiritual leaders of every generation to shepherd the flock of God by feeding them divine truth. And knowing that pastors are commissioned to shepherd the Lord's flock who are pastors asked to shepherd?</p><p>Are pastors responsible to shepherd everyone without exception? Notice in verse 2 Peter exhorts pastors to shepherd believers that are among them. Now we have to understand local church pastors are called to shepherd the flock of God among them. Pastors are given for the equipping of believers not non-believers. And when I say this I'm not suggesting that pastors do not have a responsibility for the lost.</p><p>We do have a responsibility for the lost and that responsibility is to evangelize the lost to bring them to Christ with the presentation of the gospel. But the church by definition is a gathering of believers called out from the world to worship God. That is the main purpose of church.</p><p>It is a gathering place for worshiping God and also to be equipped with the word of God for the work of ministry. The church is not a gathering of non-believers. Non-believers do not worship God nor do they have a desire to know God. The word of God tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 that an unregenerate person does not accept the things of the spirit of God.</p><p>The church is a gathering of believers and pastors are ordained to shepherd believers not non-believers. We read in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 11 and 12 that Jesus came to the world, redeemed his people, went back to heaven, sent the spirit of God to enable gifted men to build up what?</p><p>The body of Christ. The body of believers. Pastors are under-shepherds meaning they serve under the authority of Christ and they are entrusted with the care of the Lord's people by Christ. You belong to him and he has appointed gifted men to oversee his church which are the people of God.</p><p>And you know on a side note because I fear God I do have a genuine fear for those who deliberately attempt to lead the Lord's people astray because one day they're going to have to stand before Christ and give an accounting to him. God said in Jeremiah chapter 23 verses 1 and 2, "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture," says the Lord.</p><p>"Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel against the shepherds who feed my people you have scattered my flock driven them away and not attended to them. Behold I will attend to you for the evil of your doings," says the Lord. The Lord himself says I will repay false shepherds for their wrongdoings.</p><p>And knowing this truth I don't know how anyone can occupy the pulpit with the intention of leading the Lord's people astray. And this is why pastors have to examine themselves before occupying the pulpit. They have to examine themselves before they come up here and teach the word of God and says, "Thou says the Lord." Because we know that we are responsible for the Lord's people.</p><p>Yes, it is commendable to seek the office of an overseer but it comes with scrutiny and a warning to those who teach that those who teach will receive a stricter judgment from God. I often remind myself of the Apostle Paul's address to Ephesus. In Acts chapter 20 verses 28 Paul gathered the elders and this is what he told them.</p><p>"Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood." That's how precious you are to the Lord. It is a tremendous responsibility to shepherd the Lord's flock. It is a tremendous responsibility to shepherd God's people.</p><p>God's people who are redeemed by his precious blood. I mentioned earlier I have been attending at the beginning of this year and I witnessed the pastors of Berean dedicate themselves to this body with unwavering devotion. I'm personally very thankful to God for not just our pastors but even the elders who are here because they sincerely serve this body with love because the leaders do it behind the scenes when no one is watching.</p><p>I witnessed Pastor Peter faithfully minister to you with the word every week and you received in my opinion a seminary style teaching from Pastor Mark and hermeneutics and none of you had to pay a tuition fee. It was free. And Pastor Nate and I'm saying all this because they're not here.</p><p>I'm boasting about them but Pastor Nate I mean what doesn't he do right? He wears multiple hats around here. He's like the Swiss army knife of pastors. He's just everywhere and you know I had a chance to follow him this past week and just witnessing this man and his commitment to the collegians is very admirable and these are just some of the commitments that are but the work that they do behind the scenes are even more commendable.</p><p>Again the pastors will never tell you this themselves so I'm going to do it for them. Okay. But I recently got a glimpse of Pastor Peter's weekly schedule and I was floored by how just one man can have so many responsibilities in just one day. And I want you to know that your pastors are doing their best to delegate their tasks so that a church of this size doesn't seem so big to you.</p><p>They do their best to meet everyone in need all the while carrying on their ministerial duties at church. They exhort you they comfort you with the heart of a father and they do all of this so that you may walk worthy of God who has called you into his eternal kingdom.</p><p>And so when you get a chance thank the Lord that you have faithful leaders who are committed to shepherding you who sincerely care about your spiritual maturity. I remember in one of his sermons Pastor Peter shared the conversation that he had in which he answered a question and the question was how are you able to speak for all three services?</p><p>Aren't you tired? And Pastor Peter simply said it's my joy. It's my joy to minister to the people of God. Even though he is physically tired and his knees are about to give out his aging knee the joy of serving the Lord's body is what keeps this man going.</p><p>And I wrote in my notes what he said that day. Pastor Peter said and this is a quote from Pastor Peter Your pastor he said we are able to rejoice be thankful not when my pursuits are achieved but because of what I have in Christ. Those are the words of a man who can rejoice in all circumstances and be thankful because of what he has in Christ.</p><p>And you know I was encouraged to hear those words from Pastor Peter who doesn't just say the word but actually models what he says. Brian you are tremendously blessed to have faithful leaders here. Then in verses 2 and 3 we see instructions on how elders are to shepherd the Lord's flock.</p><p>We are to shepherd the Lord's flock with integrity and honesty. He said shepherd the flock of God among you exercising oversight not under compulsion but voluntarily according to the will of God and not for sordid game but with eagerness nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge but proving to be examples to the flock.</p><p>Now in this imperative to shepherding the Lord's flock there are both positives and also negatives. First I want us to observe the positive ways to shepherd the Lord's flock and I'll go through these quickly. Peter says in verse 2 shepherd the flock of God. Now what does it mean to oversee?</p><p>The word oversight is translated from the Greek word of pescapel and its basic definition means to accept responsibility for the care of other people. And this word has the idea of positioning oneself on a high place to scope things out to watch over and just as we have read in Hebrews we watch over the souls of men.</p><p>And what does it look like for pastors to watch over the flock of God? Well we do this first of all in prayer. We pray for the sheep. We pray for the Lord's people. And secondly we diligently study God's word so that we may present the words of God to you that has life and godly instructions.</p><p>And then we're always keeping a watch for the encroachment of error that constantly undermines and attacks the authority of the scripture. (Pause) We have oversight of the Lord's people. Secondly pastors are to be examples to the flock. Pastors are to lead by example. And this is why the qualification of a pastor to have a reputation that is above reproach is extremely important.</p><p>Pastors are to be involved in the lives of those that he is shepherding and to model a pattern that the people can follow. And so you see it's not just leadership from on high where we have oversight. It is also leadership from within. There's a balance. A shepherd needs to balance both tasks.</p><p>A shepherd must keep watch on the high place to get a scope of what is happening all around them. He must look out for predators. He must be on the lookout for wandering sheep. He must be an overseer of the Lord's flock. But before the day is over a shepherd comes down from his watch.</p><p>He walks in the midst of the flock to check the condition of the flock. He looks for the ones that are sick. The ones that aren't eating well. The ones that are injured. The ones that are hurting. And he shepherds them. A shepherd balances both tasks. He has oversight to protect, provide, and guide.</p><p>But he is also an example to the people of God. And he does this by being within. These are the positive ways to shepherd the Lord's flock. But there's also a negative way in which pastors can abuse the Lord's people. And the Apostle Peter warns pastors should never shepherd the Lord, the flock of God in this manner.</p><p>He said in verse 2, "Not under compulsion, but voluntarily according to the will of God and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness. Nor yet as lording it over those under your charge." The first negative thing we notice is compulsion. Shepherding the Lord's flock because you are pressured into doing it, not because you want to do it.</p><p>If a pastor needs someone to constantly push him because he is not motivated by the compelling and the love of Christ to shepherd his people, he has a serious problem. Peter says if you're in a situation where someone has to force you to do the work of shepherding the Lord's people, don't do it.</p><p>Because if you're forced into shepherding the Lord's people, eventually you will grumble and you will quit. Pastoral ministry is not for men who have to be pushed to perform the task of shepherding his people. If a man is going to shepherd the people of God, he must do it under divine compulsion and not under the compulsion of men.</p><p>He must do it voluntarily because he knows that this is God's will. The second negative, he says, not for sordid gain. Men should never seek the office of a pastor for dishonest gain. In other words, money should never be the motive that compels a man to shepherd the Lord's people.</p><p>Yes, a pastor who labors in the word and doctrine, a pastor who shepherds the Lord's flock to equip them with the word are worthy of double honor. And according to 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 14, the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.</p><p>However, making money is never the motive of a pastor called to ministry. Contrary to all the prosperity preachers, a faithful leader never puts a price on his ministry. A pastor should not be greedy for money. And we read about this in 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 3 and also in Titus chapter 1 verse 7.</p><p>A pastor, a faithful pastor never pursues ministry for sordid or dishonest gain. He must be honest. He must learn to be content in all things. He must be thankful in all things knowing that godliness and contentment is great gain. It is never the pursuit of money. It is the pursuit of Christ and making him known to his people.</p><p>And the third negative which is mentioned in verse 3 nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge. Now the word lording means to dominate. It's to dominate someone. It's the word describing an oppressive kind of leadership a dominating leadership that seeks power over other people. And Peter says don't you ever treat the Lord's people this way.</p><p>They are his people entrusted to your care and he is not going to tolerate any man who abuses his vested authority to lord it over the Lord's people. There is a place for pastoral authority but it's a gentle authority. There is no place for oppressive leaders in the church.</p><p>If a man seeks to be a leader in the Lord's church he must be a servant of all. Jesus said the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over their people. That's what non-believers do but this must not be among us for whoever wishes to become great among us this body of Christ we must be a servant of all.</p><p>Jesus himself said I did not come to be served but to serve as a ransom for many. We need to model that here. So how are pastors to shepherd the Lord's flock? By spiritual oversight. Getting the scope of what is and what is to come. By being an example to the flock and to have a life of service free from the need for compulsion where someone has to constantly force us to do ministry work.</p><p>Free from greed. Free from dominating leadership. That's how pastors are to shepherd the Lord's flock. And why do we do all of this? If you notice with me finally spiritual leaders are exhorted to shepherd the Lord's flock anticipating the appearing of the chief shepherd. Notice what Peter says in verse four.</p><p>And when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the unfading crown of glory. So why do pastors have to shepherd the Lord's flock? Do we shepherd the Lord's flock to receive praises from men and say good job pastor? Do we do it for self-esteem? For personal glory? It's none of those things.</p><p>It is because someday we have to stand before the chief shepherd. That's why. Jesus Christ is the chief shepherd and one day we will have to give our account to him. And I always have to remind myself of this truth that one day when he appears I will stand before him to give an account and all of my intentions all of my motives will be scrutinized by an omniscient judge who knows everything.</p><p>This is why pastors must shepherd the Lord's flock with integrity and virtue. Serving as overseers not for possession but voluntarily not for sordid gain but for eagerly not as being lords over the people of God but being an example to the flock. And so why do pastors do it?</p><p>And what is it that the pastors have to do? It is because we're compelled by the love of Christ and we are called we're responsible to shepherd the flock of God who is among us believers entrusted to our care. And how are we to shepherd the Lord's flock? Pastors are to shepherd the flock of God by feeding them the word of God and to set an example by modeling the word within.</p><p>And why do pastors do all this? It is because we are compelled by the love of Christ to give an account to the chief shepherd and when the task is done faithfully the promise of scripture is that God himself will one day crown us with an unfading crown of glory.</p><p>And before I close I need you to understand that I chose this specific text praying about it meditating on it and I chose this text not to simply boast in myself and not like other men. If any of you know my testimony you know I am an imperfect man born with the sin nature like the rest of us.</p><p>I was a rebel I was a rebel filled with malice and hatred for people I am the least of all men and yet the Lord was merciful to me a sinner and he saved me by his grace so that in me at the foremost Jesus Christ might demonstrate his perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.</p><p>You know when comparing myself to other men who have gone astray in their ministry or even the ones that are remaining faithful today I am no different from them in the sense that I share the same fallen nature with them. Yes I am justified freely in Christ yes I am being conformed to sanctification yes I am not who I used to be but I will be lying to you today if I said that I no longer struggle with this body of sin and death and you know I came to realize that until I am fully redeemed in glory I must run in such a way as the apostle Paul said as not beating the air aimlessly but I discipline my body and I make it my slave so that after I have preached to others I myself will not be disqualified.</p><p>I strive daily to work out my salvation in fear and trembling knowing that it is God who is working in me. The reason I share this message with you on my first official day is not only for my personal introspection but I share this with you as a way to elicit your continued prayers and support for me.</p><p>In addition to the exhortation to pastors and knowing what is expected of me I am humbly asking you the church to keep me accountable but also to pray for me so that I can walk worthy of the call for which God has called me that I do not cause harm and disappointment to the people of God but to be an example to the people of God as the words from your pastor so if you have notes write it down, okay but to repeat the words of Pastor Peter to truly find joy and be thankful not when my pursuits are achieved but because of what I have in Christ Jesus so having said that I ask again keep me accountable pray for me and I will do my best to serve this amazing body that we know as Berean Community Church let's say a word of prayer Father what a great responsibility that you have given to us to watch over the souls of men and to be a shepherd of your precious flock to lead them in your word so that they may know everything that pertains to salvation that they may know everything in regards to holiness of life and as we minister Lord I pray that we will be faithful to you and that we will be faithful and loving to your sheep as shepherds who have been commissioned to do this work and I thank you for the opportunity that you granted to me and I ask that you would always keep me humble and remind me that I am a servant and that I am here to serve your body and so Lord thank you again for the amazing opportunity that you granted to us and thank you for this wonderful body and I pray that you will continuously bless them Lord and minister to them through your word and we pray all this so please stand for our closing praise (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) And may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the love of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now and forever more Amen (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music) (piano music)</p></div></body></html>
