Welcome to Praise and Prayer. This is something we do once a month or so, and it's cool because we can all gather together as a church, and I'm sure people are still tuning in virtually here, and our hope is that we become more and more of a prayerful church, a one who comes before our God to request to Him different things, but in a very personal, intimate way that we can actually pray to Him. And so before we begin, I'll pray for the night, and then we're gonna be singing a few songs. Would you bow your heads with me? Heavenly Father, we thank You. After long weeks, we get to the end on these Fridays, and God, sometimes we're just so tired. But Lord, we know where our rest is, and God's right here in prayer, and in the throne room of grace where we can come to our Father and talk with You. Father, would You strengthen us? Would You help us, God, not to see prayer as duty? Would You help it to be an intimate affair, and Father, something that we love to do? God, would You help us to exercise this discipline in our lives? Would You help us to grow and to love You and others more through it? And God, most of all, would You cause us to be a prayerful church that we might understand that all things are in Your hands and not in ours? So Lord, as we sing these songs to You, would You be honored and worshiped? In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Church family, why don't we all stand together for worship?

Amen, you may be seated. (gentle music) All right. Okay, again, welcome back. These prayer nights are very special because when we think about prayer, it could be as simple as us just sending these things to you via a Word document, and then you can just pray at home by yourself. But I love these nights because there's something about us knowing that we're all praying together, and there is a unity of heart and mind and spirit in prayer that I think is more than worth the drive that you make here to come together, to pray together for these topics. And so I hope that it's an enjoyable thing. As hard as it is, I hope that we leave very encouraged and refreshed because in prayer, there is a great uniting of hearts that I think happens in the midst of it. So same thing as what we've been doing, we're gonna be giving you a lot of time tonight, a good chunk of time kind of undisturbed for you to pray. But before that, just a quick word. When we think about prayer and when we think about what we're doing here, there are many facets of prayer that we can kind of wiggle around and try to see what angle our prayer's supposed to be. Tonight, I wanted to concentrate on just one thing that I think is very easy for us to forget when it comes to prayer. And what that is is who we're praying to. Now, I know that should be an obvious thing and I know that we do keep God in mind, but what I mean by that is when we pray and we come before God, do we take the time to honestly and deeply and even very sharply evaluate who God is and who this God is that we're praying to? We have many things that we want to pray for. I think right now, if I asked you, is there something that you wanted to pray for tonight, I think there would be a lot. I think there are a lot of things going on in our lives. I think there are a lot of people in our lives that are struggling and going through difficulties and in sin. I think there's a lot that we need to let go of, that we need to confess for ourselves. But before that, our concentration on who God is, knowing who it is that we're talking to other than just kind of the general, like, oh, it's the God, the sovereign God, to take a quick step back and remember it and know him and see him in a very crisp way. When you talk to someone, you're very aware of who they are. And when you're talking to someone and especially if you have requests for someone, who they are tends to matter. So this past Sunday, I was very challenged by the Sunday sermon and this idea of God's love and this idea of what it means that he's our father. When we're talking to someone, especially if it's our father, who they are is going to start to dictate what we ask for, how we approach, and what they do. So for example, if for a living, they do something very specific, then we're gonna be very quick to ask him for things in regard in lines as to what that is. Do you guys know what I'm kind of saying by that? I'm getting kind of blank stares. Okay, so what I mean by that is, if our dad owns a restaurant, and I'm trying to open up a restaurant, then I will talk to him about those things because I know who he is. I know he's aware. I know he has wisdom in regards to these things. I know he has strings he can pull. I know there are a lot of things. Based on who he is, how I ask will matter. If my dad knows nothing about it, I won't go to him. So who I believe God to be is going to start to affect how I pray. And when we pray, and when we evaluate our prayer, and we think like, man, why don't I come to him enough? Why don't I pray to him about everything? It says a lot about how I view God. It says a ton about what I believe he's capable of, what he's like, what he desires, or what he doesn't desire. And so then we have kind of a shadowy figure that we're praying to, and then we just kind of come, and we give our prayer request. Here it is. We try to generate the best we can. What about in our prayers tonight? Are we going to be fully aware tonight? Because there's a long list. There's a whole page of prayer that things that you can be praying for tonight. Through it all, will you remember the one that you're praying to? And that needs to be regularly practiced, even in the middle of prayer, because we forget. And we just kind of get into this mode of like, here are the requests, here's my dutiful prayer. See, I prayed for that person like I was supposed to, and we forget who he is. If you believe that God is sovereign, don't you think that's gonna affect your prayer? If you really believe that I'm looking at God, and he is a sovereign God, don't you think that's going to change the way you pray? That you'll start to ask of him things that really matter? Do you believe that God is all-powerful? Don't you think that's going to matter? Like, that sight of who God is. If we believe that he is actually all-powerful, don't you think our prayers will become bigger? Do you believe that God loves you as a father? Don't you think that's gonna change the way you pray? The confidence in which you come before him? If you believe that God is everything, that he is the center to everything, and all of life is about him, don't you think that's going to change the way you pray and what you pray for? Our prayers are gonna reflect a lot about how we see God. Be aware of that tonight. 'Cause again, it's gonna be a big chunk of time, like 30 plus minutes of just prayer. And if we lose who God is in the midst of prayer, then we have to really evaluate and think, what am I doing? Keep God squarely at the center of prayer tonight. And just to turn you, just one last note here. When you think of Jesus when he says, "Pray like this," I think this is a big part of the reason why he says start with, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name. "Your kingdom come, your will be done." Because there's a great orientation that needs to be happening. Prayer is not just a ritual or religious exercise. You're talking to God. You're coming to him with requests. And you're desiring what he desires. It's a very intimate thing. Where we are, God is listening to his children. So I think we can marvel at that. And I think if we do that, our prayers can become a lot more powerful and refreshing. Because it's not just something we're doing. So if we could keep that in mind tonight. Now, we're gonna be doing, again, something similar to what we did last month. Which is, I'm gonna give you guys just a moment here, after we go through this list of prayer, to go ahead and turn to each other and say prayer requests. And then after that, you're gonna have that chunk of time to pray unfettered. So if you can get that list out. It's gonna be broken up into five major sections. And the first one is the sins to confess. And we did something like this last time. Sins of commission, what sins have I committed or have stopped struggling with? And this is a time to take stock of that. I think we're much more aware of sin than we might think. And we're just very good at burying those things. And then sins of omission, what have I not done that I should have done? So you can ask these types of questions when you're thinking about sin in your life. What are the things that you've found yourself grumbling over lately? Where have you been very complaining in your heart? Have you been deceitful in your life? Are you lying right now to somebody? Are you hiding? Are you in the dark? Have you been lazy? Have you been struggling with pride and arrogance? Bitterness and anger? And this is the time where you can take this, that chunk to really go deep and say, God, I confess these things before you. As it says in 1 John 1, he calls us to confess because we have sin in us. The second one there is building up of the church. Letter A, are there relationships that need to be reconciled that we have been ignoring? Do you have something against someone or does someone have something against you? I ask you there as you're praying, really consider God's love, God's forgiveness. Have you been dealing with people the way God has dealt with you? Have you been keeping people in mind and desiring to love others the way God has loved you? Have you been seeking people out? Have you been pursuing them if there's conflict between you? In the Sermon on the Mount, there's a section that talks about this where it says, like if you have an offering, hey, leave it at the altar and go and reconcile with your brother before you come back and give it. Letter B, pray for people God has been placing on your heart to reach out to and encourage. Have there been people that just, when you think about people you desire to reach out to, are there people there, but then you just haven't been reaching out to them? You haven't been praying for them? And their names are just constantly there. You're just made aware of them by something that God has placed on your heart. Well, pray that you and all of us, that we would all pursue a deep relationship within this church for mutual edification, through reading, praying, and speaking the gospel in judge's lives. That we wouldn't just say like, hey, I'm just gonna grab a meal with them, but that we would be going this long distance to saying that we want to be a church that prays for this. That we read together, that we pray together regularly. Letter C, pray for sexual purity, specifically as more and more people are struggling with porn and sexual immorality. Pray for a greater resolve to fight against impurity in what we watch, in what we allow ourselves to kind of think about. Remember, this is like one of those sins that people just reside in such darkness. If that's you, I mean, hopefully you would have already confessed those sins. But pray for others. Pray deeply that Satan wouldn't have a foothold in their lives. Pray that they would have the confidence to come out of the darkness and to confess their sins with you, and that if you need to do that, that you would do that with others. It's such a damaging thing for the church because it's in such darkness. Letter D, pray for specific people in your lives. You could pray for a home group or small group members by name. You could pray for the church leadership by name. Pray for someone you met this past week. For the very first time, pray for them. Pray for people you know are struggling through different things. Letter E, pray for the gradual opening of the church. This is a tough one because as things are opening up, we know how volatile these kinds of conversations are. But as small groups and home groups, and we're gonna be doing the church retreat in person, there's gonna be VBS in person, it's gonna be a lot to navigate through. But pray for all of these things as everything starts to go live. People have varying opinions on what should or shouldn't be done. Pray. Pray that the leadership would have wisdom in making decisions that's for the best of the church. But also pray that church members would be willing to consider others more important than themselves. That we wouldn't be people saying, like, this is right, this is wrong. But that we would really operate in that realm of grace. That we desire what is best for those that are around us, and that we are doing everything in order to ensure that. Pray that God would protect the church from the enemy because he has been using, obviously, these things, this situation and this particular circumstance, to divide. And let's be honest, it's entered the church. It's entered between us. Let's pray. Let's pray that the enemy wouldn't have that foothold, and that we would maybe not be able to all get onto the exact same page, but the same page that we are all on is that we love each other, and that we desire to grow with one another. Letter F, pray that we would use any and all of our finances, well, for God's kingdom and not our own. Pray that if there is anything that you're not surrendering in your own life when it comes to finances, that you would let go of the things that are aimed at building up your own life, alone, and not God's kingdom. Letter G, pray for local churches. Pray for the leadership at other churches. There are many churches around us. We're just one church. Imagine the battle going on in every church out there, and pray, pray for them, that as the leaders in other churches are wrestling with various challenges coming from what happened in this past year, pray for clarity and greater faith, that leaders here and there wouldn't fall to people-pleasing and fear, wouldn't fall to just doing what would be the easiest, per se, but to really do what would be the most honoring to God based on the truth of his word. The third section will be concerning the gospel, spreading the gospel. Locally, pray for coworkers and family members who are not Christian. Pray for them by name. We did this last time, too. Pray for opportunities. Now, this is a good time to go back and reflect on who you prayed for last time, but pray for them again. Pray regularly. Pray for opportunities that might come up in coming days. Pray if there's an opportunity that you foresee coming, that you would be bold and you would have the courage to approach them at that moment. Pray that God would use the church to bring greater numbers of people to be followers of Christ. Globally, pray for Alex and Jen, Harry and Linda in Taiwan as they wisely try to navigate through uncertainty. It's really hard right now. If you have a relationship with them, pray for them specifically. If you don't know them well, pray for them as people who desire to spread the gospel in the place that God places them, that they would be able to function off of wisdom and a love for the Lord and not according to their own plans. Pray for the India pastors, especially, specifically tonight, with Pastor Isaac passing away. We all heard the news, but if you have not yet prayed for him, let's use tonight to collectively really lift up these pastors. They had a funeral for him this past week, and obviously, I mean, they're gonna be very sad about this. This is hard. This is someone they've been looking to and praying for for so long, and now everything has changed, and there's a huge hole in their hearts there. Let's pray for them, that the believers there would be encouraged, that the hope of eternity, that the hope in God's unshattering, unbreakable plan would be resting strong in their hearts, that they would be comforted, and that they would push each other more and more even, and that God would raise up strong leaders and someone that would be able to fill those shoes. Pray for all the missionaries who have been displaced because of persecution and COVID. Pray that they would clearly see God's sovereign hands in all that's going on. There's so many missionaries around the world, and we need to remember that moving into number four here, that there are persecuted brothers and sisters around the world. There's so much talk about the difficulties that we're going through, and it is difficult, but there are brothers and sisters who need our prayers tonight. Our prayers can be felt across the world. It won't be fully recognized maybe, but it could be felt. We need to pray for them. We need to pray for our brothers and sisters who we've never met before, who are tonight at risk of their own lives. Pray for them. Let us see, pray for greater opportunities for the gospel to spread locally and globally as the pandemic and racial tensions have created a greater sense of unrest in our generation. If you're not aware, there are a lot of people coming through the church right now, and they might just look like a newcomer, but they might be someone who don't know God at all and who are looking for answers, and they just look like everyone else, but let's pray for them, and let's look out for them on Sunday. Even in college ministry, this quarter has been crazy because constantly there are students coming through right now who have never once set foot in church, and this quarter is their first time. Let's pray for them. Let's pray for more opportunities. Let's pray that we would seek for more people who would come to know Christ, who would be saved from God's wrath, and let's pray specifically because, again, this is a very good time. This is a very, I would say, ripe time for us to not only be praying but reaching out in that manner. Moving on to Roman numeral four there, section four, pray for the upcoming events in the church. Now, I just listed a few here, and there are a lot more, and you can pray a lot more concerning the things going on even in your own affinity, but take that time to just, one at a time, if you have the time at the end, to pray for these things that are coming up. We have the golf tournament tomorrow, and you can look through all of these things, but that they wouldn't be prayerless events that are just happening, right? That we just say this is a fundraiser for missions, and so we just do it. Let's make sure that we gird all of those things in prayer, and that we're saturating that in prayer, and that we're lifting it up to God and saying, God, of course, things might not go exactly the way we want it to, but God, would you empower it? Would your Holy Spirit move through it, even though it's something we're just doing? Okay, so there's a lot to pray for. This is not a duties list tonight. You do not need to get your pen and strike each one out as you're going. Pray, and get through as much as you can, yes, but take the time to go through the ones that weigh heavy on your heart. But before we go into that, let's go ahead, and I'll give you about five minutes or so to turn to maybe in groups of three or so to pray, or to share prayer requests. And just like last time, please don't take too much time, because if you do, then at the end, the last person's gonna be rushing, right? That's not fair. So go ahead and turn to each other now. Write it down on the back of your paper, and then that's gonna be a part of our list. I'll bring us back, okay, and to enter into that time together.

(silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) Okay, all ready or not? You were given fair warning, so. Let's bring it back towards the center. (audience laughing) All right, so, keeping in mind that you have a whole paper and don't forget to get to that side. And a good thing is you can take this home and pray, like continually pray for these things, so you don't have to stress out tonight. Because if you didn't notice last time, when you were given that big chunk of prayer, you realized, wow, I could really pray for a long time. There's a lot to pray for. And so tonight, let's use the next 30 to 35 minutes or so to pray. Please remember, if it is difficult, it's okay. It's an okay thing for it to be difficult. We are practicing this together and work through it. And at the end, after that time, we're gonna be having the praise team come up. We're gonna be worshiping together and I pray that, that really after having been praying to our God for 30, 35 minutes, even our worship changes. Even our praise and the songs that we sing to God is different and that we would be able to be in full awareness and I just, I pray to God for the last 30 minutes and we would want to worship Him. Okay, let me go ahead and pray for us and then we'll go into this time. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that over the next 30 minutes or so that you would help us to have the concentration, to have undistracted, determined motivation. Father, would you help us to fight through this, God, to fight to remember you and to give to you everything that's on our hearts. Help us, Lord, to dive deep. Help this not to be just a time where we're dutifully going through a list but Lord, that we are coming into your throne room of grace. And again, as we've learned, Lord, that we are coming to our Father. And God, that we might desire so heavily the things we're asking. Lord, that we would plead with you and cry out to you because we know that you are the only sovereign God. Lord, we're frail and weak but we pray to you an omnipotent God. God, we trust in you with all of these prayers. Lord, allow these things to dissipate our anxieties, that our trust in you and our faith would be pure. So God, thank you that you give us such a privilege and honor to pray to you. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

Heavenly Father, we thank You, Lord, for You are a God who is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love and kindness. Father, we thank You so much for this opportunity tonight for us as a church to gather and to pray. Lord, we know that more than anything else that we do, coming before You and asking You for help, Father, God, is the best use of our time. Lord, I pray that You would open our eyes to be able to see things through Your lens, through Your eyes, Lord. Lord, we live day by day entangled with various responsibilities, distracted, things that are going on at work, in our homes, at school. But in the midst of all these things that distract us, Lord, help us as we pray to have an eternal perspective. Lord, that we would be kingdom-minded to pursue things that truly, really matter. Teach us what it means, God, to be truly broken for the lost, what it means to pray, Lord God, with a genuine desire to see lost souls saved, even the ones we do not know. To help us, Lord, to live by faith and not by sight. Teach us, you know, especially with our theme this year, Lord, as we desire to be a church that really prays. For though we are weak, Lord, would You make us strong, that we would be vessels used for Your kingdom. And help us, Lord, to be a church that exalts and glorifies You in all that we do. So again, Lord, we thank You so much for this evening, for this opportunity to gather, to worship You, to pray, Lord. Would we be a church that truly glorifies You in all that we do. So we thank You, Lord, for all that You are to us and all that You have done for us. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thank you, everyone, for coming this evening. We want to ask you guys to be safe. Thank you again.</p></div></body></html>
