The first section of it, verse…</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=219s">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is it? Verse 1 to 3, or 1 to 5, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, again, emphasis on the scope of the judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=228s">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so Thursday, verses 1 through 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How is God's judgment depicted in Isaiah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=237s">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God judged through Assyria, but now He's judging through natural disaster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mention anything in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but again, if you look at the language in verse 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=247s">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the earth is kind of turned upside down, maybe an earthquake, maybe a tornado.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you look at verse 4, right, it talks about how the earth mourns and it withers and it languishes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=259s">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the language of, you know, like the harvest drying out and no more wine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of gives you the picture of some kind of a drought and there's no harvest, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=269s">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the judgment is not just one particular nation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=273s">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">another nation is going to come and conquer you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=276s">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a worldwide judgment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=279s">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the natural disaster is not just happening in one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, what does that sound like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=284s">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Book of Revelation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=286s">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The very end times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this is not a fact, but again, the language kind of points to some kind of natural disaster or disasters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, verse 2, it talks about the scope of judgment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=300s">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about that, how if you look at verse 2, it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=303s">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"And it shall be as with the people, so with the priests, as with the slaves, so with the master, as with the maids, so with the mistress."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So on and on and on, saying that no one's going to be spared from the highest to the low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=314s">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Businessmen and people who are lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=320s">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the conclusion of that in verse 3, so they're going to be orderly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=325s">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, you know, I would say maybe not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=330s">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The language itself may have been toned down, but if you look at what it actually says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=335s">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually the judgment is much greater than what he was saying before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before it was like, the other nation's going to come, take you captive, you're not going to have any men around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=343s">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span

describes it as order destruction, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=349s">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you look at the Book of Revelation, the judgment is not something specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/157575225#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When a
