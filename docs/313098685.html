class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=77s">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's always important to follow the flow of thought by following the syntax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=83s">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=84s">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Paul is a very logical writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=87s">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you notice, he connects his thoughts together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=90s">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes, he'll give even examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=92s">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He'll give illustrations from the past, et cetera, et cetera, and you want to identify those relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=98s">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, this is an example, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=101s">00:01:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I want to say is that from both paragraph to paragraph and then sentence to sentence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=107s">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">clause to clause, word to word, you want to find and identify what kind of relationship is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=114s">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one helpful tip that I found was just to understand what kind of relationships are there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=119s">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and what identifiers can you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=122s">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, even within our text, here we have this idea for this reason, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=131s">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you see that, you should be writing or at least jotting down on the side that this is some kind of causal relationship, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because he's saying this is the reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=142s">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, with that said, other markers of relationships show you purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, verse 10, "So that," da, da, da, da, and it shows you purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Other times, certain prepositions show you the context, show you what kind of relationship it has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I like to do is when you take a text like this and read it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=163s">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes you aren't able to immediately see the relationships that exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=168s">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I did for you here is just to show you the different kinds of relationship markers that are present in this passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I did is take this and put it into an outline form using specifically these words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=182s">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean is to look at it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=185s">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Each one of those identifying markers that I saw, or at least the relationship words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=190s">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I used that to break off that segment of the passage into an outline form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=195s">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I'm going to do now is just read it with you guys, and then after we read it, we'll walk down the passage together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it says, "For this reason also, since today we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will, in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=216s">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">strengthened with all power according to His glorious might.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=230s">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I should say "who" right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as we take a look at that, what I want to show you is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=249s">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By looking at these specific terms, I'm simply able to say, okay, this is clearly a transitional section asking the cause, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=258s">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the reason. So, what is this reason?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=261s">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I identify the main independent clause, 'We do not cease to pray for you and to ask.'</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=267s">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is the content of your prayer, that you may be filled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=270s">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is the purpose, so that you would walk in what kind of manner or how in a manner worthy of the Lord,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and what intended result for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/313098685#t=283s">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I went through that pretty quickly.
