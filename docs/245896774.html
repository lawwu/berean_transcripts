what should that look like in the life of a believer other than just acknowledging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=91s">00:01:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we believe in justification?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=94s">00:01:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification is not part two of our salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=99s">00:01:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification is the other side of the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=101s">00:01:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can't be justified and not be sanctified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=104s">00:01:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't say, "I've been justified, but I'm not committed to sanctification."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=109s">00:01:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">An individual who has been justified, it is only logical that they are moving on toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=115s">00:01:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=117s">00:01:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So last week we looked at four aspects of sanctification as an introduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=122s">00:02:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification requires our commitment where Paul urges them to offer their body as a living</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=127s">00:02:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=128s">00:02:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that we talked about is, are we committed to sanctification or is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=132s">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">something that we're just allowing passively to happen in our life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=135s">00:02:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=136s">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, sanctification is motivated and empowered by God's grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=140s">00:02:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And even sanctification, even though it requires our commitment, we recognize the internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=146s">00:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">work that God is doing inside of us that is being expressed externally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=150s">00:02:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is being motivated and empowered by the grace of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=153s">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Third, sanctification is ultimately an act of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=157s">00:02:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That our desire to be sanctified is not simply to be a better person, but that it is God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=162s">00:02:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">giving us an avenue for us to worship God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=164s">00:02:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So not just Sunday worship, but whether we are cleaning up the trash can, giving, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=170s">00:02:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of our life, both private and publicly, ultimately it is an act of worship to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=176s">00:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Fourthly, sanctification is a logical, reasonable response of worship to God for his mercies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=182s">00:03:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that if you truly believe that you've been saved by the grace of God, that only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=187s">00:03:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">logical response to that is to live in obedience to God's word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=191s">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That you can't believe in justification and not have any application of sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=196s">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the four things that we've reviewed today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=198s">00:03:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then second, in verse 2, Paul is going to go dive a little bit deeper, a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=203s">00:03:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more applicational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=205s">00:03:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that look like in the life of a believer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=208s">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that he says in application, knowing that these are the basis of understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=213s">00:03:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of sanctification, he says, "Do not conform to this world."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=218s">00:03:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Or in the NIV it says, "Do not conform to the pattern of this world."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=222s">00:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I shared with you last week, as we were wrapping up, and I think my voice did carry enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=229s">00:03:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">where I think most of you guys heard it, but when I got that email from the Indian pastors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=233s">00:03:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that persecution is being ramped up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=236s">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why the email that I got last week is different from the previous emails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=240s">00:04:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that I shared with you was that typically the persecution was just a reaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=246s">00:04:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether the pastors were preaching the gospel and then somebody in the neighborhood didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=249s">00:04:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like it and threw rocks at them and chased them out of the village.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=252s">00:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the persecution that they experienced this week was organized by the village leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=257s">00:04:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the village leader basically demanded all the village members to come and worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=262s">00:04:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this idol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=263s">00:04:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the Christians in that village who refused to go, the village leaders organized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=269s">00:04:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a mob to go and drag them out of their house and beat them outside and inside their home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=273s">00:04:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why it was much more serious than the other ones that we reported to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=278s">00:04:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they've asked us to pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=280s">00:04:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The main leader, Pastor Matthew, some of you guys who've been to India with us, he is trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=285s">00:04:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk to the village leaders to try to calm them down, to allow the Christians to be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=290s">00:04:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the villages in a peaceful manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=292s">00:04:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't heard back from them, but I think it is, again, it is something that we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=296s">00:04:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to actively pray for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=298s">00:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll, again, give you a heads up if I get more information about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=303s">00:05:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the benefits, if you want to call it a benefit, of being in a situation where persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=308s">00:05:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is clear is that the world and the church, there is a clear line where you stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/245896774#t=316s">00:05:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you know who the Christians are because to be a Christian means that you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
