and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=16s">00:00:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the slain lamb and how that's being worshipped and all these other things, the seven horns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=22s">00:00:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">seven eyes, all of these things are actual, like visual presentations of specific doctrines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=29s">00:00:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and specific redemptive acts that you and I probably already know, but you get a visual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=35s">00:00:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of basically the gospel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=38s">00:00:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we're looking at today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=41s">00:00:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, last week we looked at the first two scenes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=48s">00:00:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The third scene is a scene of the sealed

promise of fulfillment of redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=57s">00:00:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of mankind, and that's basically what you're going to see being played out in chapter five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=64s">00:01:04.680</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=70s">00:01:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">every nuance and every aspect of the gospel, but if you were to picture God humbling himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=77s">00:01:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and becoming a man to be sent as a sacrifice for our sins, the way the Bible describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=83s">00:01:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it is as the lion of Judah becoming as a slain lamb, and that's how it's visually presented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=89s">00:01:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to us.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=95s">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that the scroll was in God's right hand, signifying his control and authority,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=103s">00:01:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that God has the final say over all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=107s">00:01:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the reason why they can't open up the seal is because God's the one who put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=111s">00:01:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the seal on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=113s">00:01:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So not anybody can open this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=115s">00:01:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">No creature can just come and open this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=120s">00:02:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that there's writings inside, and basically it's full, signifying the completeness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=128s">00:02:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can't add to it or take away from it because the scroll is already full.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=132s">00:02:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It is complete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=133s">00:02:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's nothing more to be written, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=137s">00:02:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that is going to say, everything that is going to happen, it is already written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=144s">00:02:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's nothing that's going to change, and that's what it signifies when the scroll is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=147s">00:02:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">full front and back, right?</span></div><div

Isaiah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=157s">00:02:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">29, Daniel 8, they all have this very similar vision where they see...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=165s">00:02:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just read Ezekiel 3.10, it says, "And he spread it before me, and it had writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=169s">00:02:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=173s">00:02:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and woe."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=174s">00:02:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see in all these various passages where there is a description of the drama of redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=180s">00:03:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">being played out, and it says that all of this was already recorded, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=186s">00:03:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That this was not just some God looking down history and figuring out, okay, maybe they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=190s">00:03:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do this, and he just happens to be a really good fortune teller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=193s">00:03:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He says the reason why it's written is because God has already determined it, and it is full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=199s">00:03:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">inside and out, so nothing's going to be changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=201s">00:03:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that is written in it will take place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=208s">00:03:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "It is sealed up with the seven seals, signifying that the words can only be released</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=213s">00:03:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">by someone who has authority."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=214s">00:03:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, in the Roman culture, if something was extremely important, it was required by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=222s">00:03:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">law to have at least seven witnesses, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=225s">00:03:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible asks for two or three witnesses, but again, in the Roman, when it was something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=229s">00:03:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">very significant, there had to be seven witnesses to testify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=233s">00:03:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it may be playing off of that idea, possibly, but again, in the Bible, the number seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=238s">00:03:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously is a representative of something complete, final, and typically we say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=244s">00:04:04.580</a></span> | <span

there are seven seals, it signifies that God is the one who has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=252s">00:04:12.300</a></span> | <span

therefore, no one can come and just open it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=262s">00:04:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">In verse 2 and 4, if you read it, it's John's response to what's going on, and he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=269s">00:04:29.540</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=274s">00:04:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">scroll and break its seal?' and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=278s">00:04:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">able to open the scroll or look into it, and I began to weep loudly because no one was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=283s">00:04:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=286s">00:04:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So if verse 1 is a description of the scroll and that God's redemptive plan, in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=294s">00:04:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">for that to be opened up, somebody who had to be worthy had to come and open it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=299s">00:04:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So in verse 2, it describes who can open it up, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=304s">00:05:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the first thing that I thought about when I saw that scene is when you're in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=308s">00:05:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">marriage

| <span class="t">but you've probably been to a wedding where the officiant would ask, "Who gives away the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=321s">00:05:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, nobody in there is like, "Well, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=327s">00:05:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the purpose of doing that is to proclaim that the two families have come together and</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=337s">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You spent all that money and preparation for all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=340s">00:05:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But they go through that drama to basically say, publicly proclaim, to act out, to leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=347s">00:05:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and cleave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=355s">00:05:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's what it reminds me of in verse 2 when it says, "Who is worthy?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=359s">00:05:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost kind of like a setup to point to Christ, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=364s">00:06:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they kind of act out like, well, they went and searched everywhere.</span></div><div

up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=383s">00:06:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, John already knew what it would mean if that thing

means condemnation for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221320314#t=402s">00:06:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, I already mentioned
