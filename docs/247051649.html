things that you would expect, a lot of the problems that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/247051649#t=239s">00:03:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you would expect in the early church, we see it in the letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/247051649#t=242s">00:04:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact,

underlying theme of that is this prejudice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/247051649#t=270s">00:04:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for or against rich or

each other's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/247051649#t=315s">00:05:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">homes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
