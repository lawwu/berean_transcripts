The door has already been opened. The battle has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3167s">00:52:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">already been won. So when we see that warning sign, if you believe, there is no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3173s">00:52:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">reason not to pay attention. So only an unbeliever will listen to this and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3178s">00:52:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">"Ah, forget it," because they don't believe.

It's been months and years since you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3195s">00:53:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">prayed and cried out to God. It's been months and years since you've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3200s">00:53:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">praising His name, but it was just all lip service. If that's where you are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3206s">00:53:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">return.

So again, my prayer is as we welcome our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3217s">00:53:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">worship team to come back up, let's take some time to come before the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3223s">00:53:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">again and be honest and pray and be fervent. If your heart has become hardened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/358670992#t=3229s">00:53:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for whatever the reason, don't justify that.
