Good morning, church family. Happy Lord's Day. I hope you had a good week in the Lord. In Psalm 92, it reads, "It is good to give thanks to the Lord "and to sing praises to your name, O Most High, "to declare your lovingkindness in the morning "and your faithfulness by night. "With a 10-stringed lute and with the harp, "with resounding music upon the lyre. "For you, O Lord, have made me glad by what you have done, "and I will sing for joy at the works of your hands. "Amen." (soft piano music) We're gonna begin our worship by singing a song, "It is Good to Praise the Lord."

Welcome to Friend Community Church. And I'm sure as some of you guys may have already noticed as you're coming in to find parking, the Ortho parking lot that's on the corner of Mitchell and Red Hill, it's one of the bigger ones that we've been using for a while. The church, the building was sold and they have new owners in there. And so we need to figure out a way to renegotiate the exchange that we have between them and us. And for the time being, that parking lot is shut down until further notice. So when you come in, we encourage you to use all the other lots. If you are a family with small children, again, the lot behind us is reserved for you. So it may be a little bit tricky to go find it for the first time, but there is plenty of parking there that a lot of the parents have not utilized yet. And so if you're looking for parking and you have small children, that's the first place we'd want you to park. And then obviously across the street. And we have plenty of parking. If you drive around, you'll see. Especially if you're gonna park and then get shuttled here, we have more than enough parking for that. But again, for the time being, the Ortho parking lot, again, at the corner of Mitchell, at the end of the street and Red Hill, that will be shut down for the time being. We are trying to communicate with them, but we don't know if that's gonna open up again. So just give you a heads up on that. Babysitting, there's a new ministry that's starting and the name of it is babysitting. So this is a new name that I forgot who came up with, but very clever. So it's babysitting, but it's babysitting. So those of you who have children, one year to 17 months before you send them to the Seeds Ministry for babysitting and program that they have there. But in order for us to have space and so that the program that they're running for that service, they're gonna target some of the older kids who are able to participate. So babysitting ministry is gonna be happening starting from March 3rd. Okay, sorry, is it March 3rd? Yeah, March 3rd. So not this Sunday, but then Sunday afternoon. And it's relevant only to this service, okay? And so if you have children that age, between one and 17 months, you drop off the kids over there and they'll be, volunteers will be out babysitting. They've already carpeted the floor, so it's cushiony, so it's not on solid ground. And so they're gonna be decorating and getting that room ready. So it's not this, it's coming Sunday, but Sunday afterwards, that ministry will be open, okay? Then obviously after 17 months, they'll be coming to the Seeds Ministry after that. Old Testament Survey, as I already mentioned, on March 3rd, for six weeks, Pastor Peter Chung is going to be leading our church in the study of the Old Testament Survey. And if you haven't taken that class or you need a refresher on the general outline of how the Old Testament is put together and how it relates to the New Testament, that's a class I strongly recommend you to take. And so please sign up for that, and that's starting on March 3rd. Again, on March 9th, 9 a.m., we have an all-church cleaning maintenance day. So the more people sign up, the quicker it'll go and more we're able to clean the church. And I know that, you know, we've had a lot of questions. I got a church our size, wouldn't it be better if we just hired janitors to do that? But I think there is a benefit. It's not because of finances, but there is a benefit for the church to take ownership of the church that we're attending, that even though our church is a certain size, it would be beneficial to have, I think it's beneficial for our church members to take ownership of the building that we're using. And so if you're able to come out, we highly encourage you to come and help us clean. That's happening on March 9th, Saturday at 9 a.m. And then one last announcement. If you are part of the FAM 245, and this is a ministry for young couples who've been married for three years or less, there is a men's hiking fellowship that's taking place on March 9th from 7.30 to 1 p.m. And they're gonna be reviewing the design, divine design for marriage from MacArthur, John MacArthur. And then the fellowship is gonna center around that topic and they're gonna be going hiking, having fellowship. And so if you're a part of that ministry, please sign up for that with our brother, Jason Choi. All the other announcements, I'm just gonna refer you to our website and to our app. But let me pray for us for the offering. Again, if you haven't transitioned to Subsplash, we wanna encourage you to do that. We're gonna keep the Zelle open for just a little bit longer, maybe about a month longer, to give you more time to transition. And if you choose not to, you can always bring a physical offering that you can bring in the back. But again, it will only be open for a little bit longer to give you a little bit more time to transition. But let me pray for us and give you an opportunity to give, and then we'll enter into the main worship. Let's pray. Father, we've gathered here together to corporately worship you, Lord God, with our brothers and sisters. Help us to give you what is sincere in our hearts, not simply our time, not simply out of obligation. I pray, Father, that you would fill our hearts with joy and gratitude, that what we give you will be an overflow of the worship that you're creating inside of us. Help us to lift up our eyes to know where our true help comes from. Help us to be committed to the cause that you're committed to, that even in our giving, it would be in reflection of our dedication to you. May your name be honored and glorified through this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) At this time, let us stand together, and as always, take a minute to greet each other, and we will continue our worship.

Why aren't more people asking, seeking, and knocking that we also may follow the path of Christ? Let's pray. Father, you are worthy of our praise. More than simple lip service, but our very lives. Help us, Lord God, to confess and to believe and to practice that we have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer us that live, but Christ living in us. Help us, Lord God, that that may not be empty confession, but it would be our very lives, Lord. As John gave his life preparing for Christ's path, call us, Lord God, as you have planted the church, that the gates of Hades would not be able to prevail against it, that we would not live our lives in mediocrity, that we would be a community fully convicted of this truth, that wherever you lead us, that we would follow and glorify you. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Let's all stand up for the closing praise.</p></div></body></html>
