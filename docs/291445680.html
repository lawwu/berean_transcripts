class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=160s">00:02:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">how to worship God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=164s">00:02:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So back in seminary, we had to take classes, depending on which seminary you go to, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=170s">00:02:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">have different classes on this, but the theology of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=175s">00:02:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on which tradition you come from, whether you're Baptist or

theology behind why they do what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=184s">00:03:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=185s">00:03:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you grew up in a Presbyterian church or a Methodist church, you'll notice that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=190s">00:03:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the pulpit is usually on the side.</span></div><div

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=196s">00:03:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">left side, typically, you have on the left side, you have where the presider comes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=201s">00:03:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">gives announcements and maybe a prayer and then the pastor typically gives his message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=207s">00:03:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">on the right side, the pulpit that's standing on the right, because the philosophy behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=211s">00:03:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it is that at the center is the altar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=214s">00:03:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's where the communion takes place and everything else takes place on the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=219s">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go to a typical Baptist church, you'll find that the pulpit is in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=224s">00:03:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the theology or the philosophy behind that is that the foundation of the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=229s">00:03:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is God's word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=230s">00:03:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So behind everything that we do, we want the word of God to be centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=234s">00:03:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you typically go to a non-denominational church, you'll see a pulpit in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=238s">00:03:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go to a traditional Presbyterian church, I've noticed that more and more Presbyterian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=242s">00:04:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">churches are kind of bringing the pulpit to the middle because of a call to make the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=247s">00:04:07.420</a></span> | <span

Presbyterian Methodist church, you'll see it on the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=253s">00:04:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now all of this to say that the book of Leviticus really was meant for the Jewish community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=258s">00:04:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">an instructional manual on how to worship God, because that's what the tabernacle ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=263s">00:04:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=264s">00:04:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking about giving sacrifices and different kinds of offerings and all of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=268s">00:04:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">is a manual as to how a sinful people can approach a holy God for the purpose of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=277s">00:04:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everything that we're learning here are instructions on how to approach this holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=282s">00:04:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=284s">00:04:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The Lord made sure that no one ever approached Him in a casual manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=288s">00:04:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So He didn't just give general instructions and say, "Make sure that you're clean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=293s">00:04:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you do this.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=295s">00:04:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He gave specific instruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=298s">00:04:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember what happened in Leviticus chapter 10?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=301s">00:05:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The very first offering that was given, it just says, "There was a sense of seriousness."</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=332s">00:05:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, every part of the book of Leviticus was to instill in the people when they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/291445680#t=337s">00:05:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">approaching God to take it very serious.</span></div><div class="c"><span
