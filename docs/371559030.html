class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=242s">00:04:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the reason why I read the whole section was because the whole tone just before was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=246s">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like I press on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=252s">00:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm straining towards the upward call that He's given me, and then He says, "Follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=258s">00:04:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">me," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=259s">00:04:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So to say that this is a strong exhortation is kind of an understatement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=263s">00:04:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, man, if there was ever kind of an epic speech, so to speak, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=269s">00:04:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If there was ever a coach's like monologue, this would be one of those, yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=275s">00:04:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This would be one of those moments, and what He gives is this strong, strong exhortation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=280s">00:04:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for everything that He's set up in terms of His mentality, everything that He's set up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=285s">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of His perspective on life, the faith that He practices, and He says, "Join me,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=292s">00:04:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=293s">00:04:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a huge exhortational flavor to this entire passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=298s">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more, what I wanted to say is in verse 17 to 21, I'm sure one of the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=302s">00:05:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys saw was a massive comparison, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=306s">00:05:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of literary structure is that He was comparing, and then in His comparison, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=311s">00:05:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are the enemies of the cross, and He lists one, two, three, four, five different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=317s">00:05:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then He says, "But for us," and then He lists, "Da, da, da, da, da, these are true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=320s">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for us," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=322s">00:05:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so whenever you do that, it's a great moment in your Bible study to say, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=326s">00:05:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to understand this comparison in its whole, and then what is the thrust of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=332s">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">comparison to me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=334s">00:05:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If He's going to give this comparison, there's also a point to be made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=338s">00:05:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"See?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=339s">00:05:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You see this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=341s">00:05:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's one of the introductory comments that I wanted to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=345s">00:05:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the connection of that is if you review verses 1 through 16, that comparison</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=352s">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">has already been going on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=355s">00:05:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in the previous section, even before that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=357s">00:05:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, the literary structure-wise, there was a big comparison and contrast between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/371559030#t=363s">00:06:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
