and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=208s">00:03:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now some of the leaders in the church have been

kind of synchrotize and stay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=224s">00:03:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">undercover, and they're no longer

there are serious consequences and that that struggle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=234s">00:03:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is not

href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=248s">00:04:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What kind of letter would you write to that church to encourage them, to get them back</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=254s">00:04:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I give that scenario to you because that's the historical background behind why this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=260s">00:04:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">letter was being written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=262s">00:04:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that this was a church that was ignited in the beginning, and they were excited even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=267s">00:04:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the persecution as their brothers and sisters are being dragged into jail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=271s">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They were visiting them joyfully, even as their possessions are being confiscated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=276s">00:04:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But the struggle is 10, 20, 30 years have gone by, and it wasn't letting up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=283s">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It started actually increasing, and the people who are leading them and inspiring them are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=288s">00:04:48.340</a></span> | <span

author of this letter is writing this letter to encourage them from drifting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=296s">00:04:56.700</a></span> | <span

written to kind of get them to refocus and re-anchor in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=305s">00:05:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the author spends majority of this letter reminding them who Jesus is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=311s">00:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's one letter in the New Testament that you want to know about Jesus, about Christology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/685280121#t=316s">00:05:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not talking about the life of Jesus, the gospels, but the doctrine of Jesus and what</span></div><div
