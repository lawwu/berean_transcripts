My name is Matthew, and this is my testimony. So growing up, I was very shy and didn't have many friends. Like many other people, I also grew up going to church. However, in second grade, a classmate's parents introduced me to, or introduced my family to a basketball league that their son played in. I was forced into playing basketball, and although I eventually enjoyed it and made many friends through it, our games were on Sundays. As my younger brothers got involved too, we got even busier on weekends, and that meant no more going to church. Towards the end of middle school, my family started church hopping. By the beginning of high school, we began to settle down at a church. We went with a friend's family, but never really got plugged in or involved in the church community. At this point in my life, I would say that I believed that there was a God. However, I definitely didn't have a personal relationship with him. I knew that I was a sinner, but I didn't truly understand the magnitude of my sin or how my sin separated me from a holy God. I believed in a watered-down version of the gospel, not one that pierced like a sword. As the oldest sibling in my family and as the oldest of my cousins, I never had someone older around me to help prepare me for later stages in life. Therefore, going to college, I didn't know where my Christian life would go or how it would continue. I didn't know that fellowships existed at all. I didn't have a car with me or know of any good churches to attend, and so I didn't have any real expectations to pursue Christianity more while I was away from home. My first quarter of college was very lonely. I didn't have any close friends there and would only occasionally hang out with my roommates. I would sometimes listen to sermons online, but never regularly, and honestly, sometimes just to help fall asleep at night. But by God's grace, during my winter quarter, I met someone while playing basketball. We started to hang out, and he eventually introduced me to a fellowship. I started getting more involved in the fellowship, started attending a local church, and eventually moved into a department with several other guys. I was able to get a strong sense of Christian community and learn how other Christians behaved outside of church. For the first time in my life, I had people my age or older to look towards for advice and guidance. I was able to see different qualities in others that I was able to learn so much from. Through this time and a few other college experiences, I realized that I needed to have a relationship with Jesus and that I was not going to be able to find satisfaction or worth on my own through grades, friendships, or sports. I began to read my Bible, go to church regularly, and grow in my faith. I remember one particular retreat down in San Diego where the gospel struck me harder than any other time before. I finally understood how great and significant my sin was because it separated me from God. But in God's love and mercy, while I was still a sinner, Christ came to die for me. I think it's then that I truly repented and put my trust in Christ and received forgiveness. Because of my newfound understanding of the gospel and God's unconditional love for me, I've come to treasure Christ above anything else in this world. And I have a desire to glorify God in all aspects of my life, whether that's seeking opportunities to share the gospel or serving others through my career. There's still so much room to grow, but I've definitely grown spiritually and I'm able to take various life events more in stride now than before. Jumping into full-time work with enough hours for two jobs presents its own challenges, but I'm grateful that I found this church where I'm able to continue to grow along other brothers and sisters. While I struggle with sin, I'm being sanctified day by day, and especially during these chaotic and scary times, I have a hope that surpasses other hopes because it's in the promises of Jesus Christ. Thank you.  >> Matthew, do you understand when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death, and when you come out, you're uniting with his resurrected life? >> Yes. >> And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  >> Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
