Welcome to Breen Community Church. We have quite a few announcements before we get started. First of all, our members meeting is happening at 2.30. And so that's enough time for you to go and grab lunch and be able to come back here. We're going to start right at 2.30. And today we have a service fair. So all the different service teams that are serving our church are going to be all set up throughout the courtyard. And so you can visit that. Some of them is just for information, so you can get the information and just to know what's going on. Some of them, they're trying to recruit people to help out. And one of the questions that we get commonly is like, how can we jump in, how can we help out? So if you are in the process or you are a member of the church and you're not serving any specific capacity, we invite you to come and just take a look at 2.30. So again, just enough time to go grab lunch and come back and we'll start right at 2.30. Also, the sign-ups for Seasons Fellowship, Fantastic Six. I think you've already gotten an email or a Facebook post on that. If you are in the process of becoming a member or are currently a member, this is open for you. And this is for everybody who is 50 and over. And I think I mentioned this before. To our surprise, we were expecting maybe about 30 people. Found that we have more than 70 scattered throughout. You know what I mean? We're very well hidden in this church. And so if you are in that category, please sign up for that. There will be a sign-up table outside. So if you go outside after this service, there will be a table for you to go and sign up for that. And then Elder Phillip will give you whatever information that you need and they'll kind of group you together. Again, anybody who is over 50 is, again, encouraged to sign up for that. FAM 245. This is for people who've been married since I think 2019 is what Pastor Peter said. So if you are a fairly newlywed, which is probably half our church, you will qualify for this. So it's to encourage and to give you some guidance early on in your marriage to make sure that you have proper habits and to build a strong foundation in that. So Pastor Peter Chung is leading that. If you haven't signed up for it, you can sign up for it. Their next meeting is happening on May 28th. Another thing that's happening is the BCC service auction that's taking place in May. So those of you guys who participated last year, you know exactly what this is. Basically, they're auctioning off certain items or services. And the proceeds that come in for that is going to go to adoption funds. So we have an adoption fund that church had set up to encourage young families or middle-aged families if you want to adopt children. And there's a scholarship that you can apply for after you go through the adoption process. This is also open for embryonic adoption. So if you are going through that process, again, these funds are available for you. And so the funds that come in for this is going to be for that. If you have any questions about that, you can just ask later about it. And then lastly, our family ministry retreat is scheduled for August 12th through the 14th. August 12th through 14th. I know it's a few months away, but we want to make sure that you try to block that out and try to get as many people to come to that as possible. That will be on a Friday, and then we'll be back on Sunday afternoon for that. And this is for the family ministry in particular. All right. I think that's all we have for this morning. We'll take a minute to pray. And then again, if you are new to the church and you brought a physical offering, there's a box in the back right underneath that big clock. You can drop it off there. And otherwise, for the rest of us, we can take a minute. We'll give you a minute to give your offering electronically. All right. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued grace. We thank you for your love. We thank you for persevering with us. I pray that you would bless this time. May your name be praised, honored, glorified. Help us, Lord God, to give our full attention to you. I pray that you would bless this offering. Help it, Lord God, to be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your name and your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.      Church family, would you please stand with us as we continue our worship?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Theophilus is probably watching all of this and is like, "What happened?" I remember Dr. Harris years ago, when he was at our church, he said that you can tell the power of whatever hit the Earth by the effect. So if you see the crater as miles and miles long, you know that whatever hit it was powerful. A nuclear bomb, or maybe an asteroid. So if the crater is tiny, you know that the rock that hit it was tiny. If you know that the crater goes miles and miles and miles, then you know that there was something humongous. You have to remember, in that short period of time, 25 years, that it would rock the known world at that time to this degree. It had to have been a huge, huge blast. A blast that human beings have not seen up to this point. If you only grew up in this modern generation, after the Internet, you have a hard time understanding that. I remember, before the Internet, some of you guys in the other fellowship. Fantastic Six Fellowship. You guys all remember, I remember in 1987, 1988, I was up in Seattle and I attended this church. I remember worshipping, and the songs that they were singing were songs that I sang in elementary school and junior high school. This was a big church. In their English ministry, they were singing songs that we stopped singing 10 years ago. I remember coming back down and saying, "Wow, there's so much stuff happening where we're at." But it took that long. I wasn't in the countryside. This was one of the biggest churches in Seattle. But I remember thinking, "They're 10 years behind everything we do." Those of you guys who remember, even up to the '80s, everything that happened, happened in California and New York first. And then it would gradually spread. And it would take 10, 11, 12 years to get to the coastal areas, and then another 30, 40 years to the Midwest. It would just take that long to get information out. It had to be something fantastic in order for something to penetrate that far. And it would take that long. Today, you just write something on the Internet, and all of a sudden it goes viral.  Some of you guys don't know what I'm talking about. This is viral right there. Is it over? I don't know what this is called, but everybody's doing this. Somebody does this, and then the whole world is doing this. Deepest part of Africa, they're doing this. What is this? Today, in order for information to spread, it's just instantaneous. You put it online, people like it. Somebody, you know, 15-year-old has 30 million followers, and all of a sudden it goes viral, and everybody becomes a cultural trend, and the whole world changes. Like that. You want to become an author today? Just write a bunch of stuff and put it on Amazon. It's electronic copy. Then you can say you're an author. You get on and start a little blog and type a bunch of things, and maybe you're just talented, and you say something, and all of a sudden, he's an influencer. And then people are reading this thing, and people are sharing articles back and forth, and all of a sudden, there's a trend that takes place, and everybody's talking about it, even in the remotest part of the world. And all of a sudden, they have millions and millions of something that's being spread around, becoming popular. But when you go back, there's a 13-year-old in his basement who's taking a break from playing video games and has become a mass worldwide influencer. Before the internet, it wasn't like that. If you wanted to become an author, a famous author, it usually started where you're at, and you had to have been tested by the group that you're with. And people would test you to see who you are. And then if you gain enough followers because you've been tested and your influence begins to grow, you may get beyond your local area and begin to have influence maybe in the county. And then after years and years of being proven in the county that you're at, it may possibly go national. So when we were younger, you didn't have authors who were 20, 25, 30, 35-year-olds. Usually people who are influencers were in the 70s and 80s. But it didn't happen in your 20s because it took time to test everything to get to that point. So by the time somebody writes something and it begins to spread, you know that there's 30, 40 years of testing of that person, testing of the knowledge, testing of information, before it started going viral. Today, this is all you need. Now why do I say all of this? This is just 30 years ago it was like that. This is 2,000 years ago. Just to get, even if a nuclear bomb went off, it may have taken months for that news to get to a certain area. 2,000 years ago. In 25 years, the world got rocked. It got rocked. And even before Paul would show up in some remote village, they heard of him. Something happened. That a Roman official would commission a physician. I need record for this. To confirm, because what I'm hearing is crazy. Either this was the biggest hoax in human history, or Jesus came back from the dead. And what Luke is reporting is a careful eyewitness account that he recorded of what was happening at that time. The whole world got rocked. And it's been tested for 2,000 years. And it is just as powerful today as it was 2,000 years ago. So is it worth studying the book of Luke? Yes. The power behind these words is not empty. It's not just a collection of information that they threw together. Christ was resurrected. And he churned, and the history of mankind was reversed. The curse of mankind was reversed in Jesus Christ. This is the record of that. So I hope you guys are ready. Whether it takes 10 years or 15 years. I don't know how long we're going to be in this thing. But our goal is the same. That as we study the careful account, that we would come to the same conviction, without a doubt, because the purpose of conviction is transformation. That we would be convicted so that we may be transformed. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word. We pray, Father God, with our feeble minds, our distracted hearts, help us, Lord God, to jump into this record that you've carefully put together. The same power that resurrected Christ would be the same power that we will encounter. So we pray that you would guide us, lead us, that we may be convicted, that we may be transformed for the sake of your name and your name alone. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise? (music) 'Cross the shore a steady anchor in the fury of the storm When the winds of doubt blow through me And my sails have all been torn In the suffering, in the sorrow When my sinking hopes are few I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed (music) 'Cross the shore a steady anchor while the tempest rages on When temptation clears the battle and it saves the night as one Deeper still then grows the anchor Though I justly stand accused I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed (music) 'Cross the shore a steady anchor through the floods of unbelief Hopeless somehow, oh my soul now Lift your eyes to joy This my ballast of assurance, sin is love forever proved I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed It shall never be removed (music) 'Cross the shore 'Cross the shore a steady anchor as we face the wave of death These trials bear way to the glory as we draw our final breath We will cross that great horizon, clouds we've had and lies secure And the bond will be the barrier for the sorrows that we endure 'Cross the shore of our salvation, ever faithful, ever true We will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed Let's pray Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit Eternal love of God the Father Compel us, renew us, revive us, rebuke us, encourage us That wherever it is that you send us, that we may be the aroma of Christ In Jesus' name we pray, amen God sent his Son They called him Jesus He came to love Heal and forgive He lived and died To buy my pardon An empty grave is there to prove Savior lived Because he lived I can face tomorrow Because he lived All fear is gone Because I know He holds the future And life is worth the living Just because he lives Amen Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love How great, how sure His love endures Forevermore Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love United in your resurrection You lift us to infinite heights Could anything several take us from Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love How great, how sure His love endures Forevermore Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love How great, how sure His love endures Forevermore Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love</p></div></body></html>
