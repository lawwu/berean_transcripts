Because spiritually, it reflects such an important truth in our lives, that the people being baptized today are expressing and recognizing their faith. That initially by faith, they heard and accepted and believed the truth that they are in absolute need, that they are by definition sinners and destined for wrath. And upon that, they also believe that their only way of rescue, their only way of salvation is Christ. And they're going to express today that they have placed such trust on our Lord and Savior Jesus. And therefore, this baptism ceremony is reflective and iconic of the grand salvation that has been the plan of God for the ages. Now, as we think about this salvation, this salvation that we have, the scripture uses so many different categories, definition, and emphasis. For example, please take a moment to listen to these various terms. And I'm going to do a this side versus that side, a comparison, because this is the way that the scriptures describe salvation. You go from a state of completely being lost to now being found as we just sung. You go from a state of being absolutely blind in darkness to having light shine upon you and you being able to see. You go from a position where you are unrighteous, evil, sinful, and guilty to a position of holiness, righteousness, justified. You go from worthless to redeemed, having eternal value in Christ. You go from being abandoned as an orphan to being a child of God. You go from being bound as a slave to sin to freedom in Christ. You go from absolute deadness to new life in the Savior. You go from hell to heaven. Now, these are just some of the vast array of categories and definitions of what salvation is for us. So when we say that this ceremony depicts and pictures for us salvation, we're saying a lot, right? We're saying a lot. Now as I mentioned to you those things, I would like to focus your attention. As we take a moment to think about what salvation is, what are we being saved from, I would like to highlight an important truth. And the truth is this, whether you are a Christian or not, the feeling of being lost is there, right? Many people, especially in our day, have a sense of feeling of being lost, a sense of a personal identity, purpose, meaning, value. These are things that people search for even if they are not Christian, religious, or affiliated with any kind of spirituality. And that's interesting. But what's more, the other categories that I presented to you about blindness, and then moral depravity, unrighteousness, wickedness in the heart, guilt, and shame, I actually believe these are also things that people experience. What's more, people across the board, if we took a survey and asked, "Have you ever felt abandoned, distant, unconnected relationally?" I have a feeling and sentiment that many people would feel that as well. If we ask people, "Do you feel sometimes bound, like you don't have the power to do what you would like, that you don't have the restraint to stop yourself from doing the things you hate, doing the things you know are self-destructive and not good for you?" You talk to individuals who have addictions, you have talked to individuals who have patterns and habits of life that they cannot escape from. And we ask them, "Do you ever feel bound?" I'm pretty sure they'll say, "I've had those feelings many times." And then, this is a sad state of affairs. We are in America, the most privileged and vastly wealthy, I guess you can even say not just in current time, but across history, we're one of the most privileged nations across time. And yet, when you take a look at the statistic of people who feel dead and who feel the temptation to even take their own life, I mean, it's shocking and frightening. Now I'm talking a lot about feelings right now. Feelings of this one side I depicted for you. The feelings of the stuff that we want to be saved from. And what I'm saying, it is almost a universal experience. It is a feeling that we all share. And then, we ask the question, "So of those things, what's the worst?" Of those things, what is our biggest problem? I believe people who are trying to escape all these feelings of lostness, blindness, guilt and shame, worthless, being abandoned, relationally isolated, being bound, enslaved and feeling dead, what they don't recognize is that their greatest plight is not those things. What they need rescue from, what they need deliverance, what they need salvation from is not that. Why? Because all those things are the fruit of God not being in your life. Not having God is the scariest thing in life. The most at-risk scenario and circumstance you can find yourself in is being apart and far from God who is good. Take a moment to think about this. Godlessness is your greatest plight. Now, as I speak of this, for those of you who are joining us today and you are not Christian, and perhaps you've heard elements of Christianity being taught, that people want you to stop your habits of sin, you know, the standard stuff, smoking, drinking, partying, whatever it may be. I am trying to make a different case for you today. It is not that I want you to escape from the vices of normal human behavior. It is that actually we want to make sure that you understand that what you need salvation from is the kind of darkness where the light and life of God is non-existent. This is what the individuals who are sharing today are going to speak about. When they had their eyes open to see that the darkness in their life is not having a moment of, "Oh my goodness, what am I doing?" The darkness in their life is not just an absence of meaning. The darkness in their life is when they realize God is far because they are far from the Lord. You know what Scripture says in Ephesians chapter 2 verses 11 through 13? It says this, "Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision which is performed in the flesh by human hands," remember this, here's the important part, "that you are at that time separated from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenant of promise, having no hope without a God in the world." This is the most pitiful circumstance. This is what we need to escape. The contrast is in verse 13, it says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were formerly far off have been brought near." Do you hear that? The greatest plight of mankind is your separation, your exclusion, and you being a stranger to God Almighty and you having none, none of the promises, none of the goodness that I talked about earlier, whether it be being found, having light, having holiness, redeem, being a child of freedom. All those things are a fruit of God being in your life. But the sad state of affairs is our biggest problem then is not having God. And see, you realize then that earlier when I did this and I did this, although my arms are this far, the spiritual reality is I cannot even picture for you with my arms how wide and far this chasm is, right? I can't show you physically how far it is to be without God and to be with God. And this divide is so huge. Scripture goes at length and length to try to make you understand. And if anybody in your life tried to make it smaller by telling you, "It's okay, all you have to do is come to church. It's okay, all you have to do is read some books. It's okay, all you have to do is copy me," they're doing you a huge disfavor. Why? Because that's not reality. Because that's not the truth. When we are separated from God, the chasm is enormous. And the reason why I want to make this a case for you is because I find that there is an error amongst individuals that we all share. Just as we share in the experience of the depravity of man, feeling, I'm going to go down it again, feeling lost, feeling blind, feeling isolated, rejected, feeling sinful and shameful, feeling like we're orphans, feeling like we're slaved, feeling like we're dead, and feeling like we're going to be judged for it. If we all share in that experience, you know what happens next? We also share in a common practice trying to get out of it. I'm going to repeat that. If we all share in the experience of this arena of depravity and darkness, then you're going to find that we all also have a very similar pattern of trying to get out, trying to find a solution for that. And what we find are people who are trying their best to say, "All I need to do is find meaning. All I need to do is find a good leader. All I need to do is get educated. All I need to do is find some model that I can follow, find some kind of superstructure that can make me feel safe." But that is deception and falsehood. That is not seeing the reality. And what's more, that is an absolutely pitiful state, a great tragedy, if you will, because what that would amount to is an individual who is desperately in need, desperately hungry, desperately malnourished, dehydrated, thirsty, but all they're doing is chewing on air. Think about this for a moment. To assess the problem in an incorrect fashion is like an individual going to the doctors, and the doctor is starting to assess various symptoms. "Oh, goodness, your skin. It's all decaying. It has mold and fungus on your body. Oh, my goodness, your eyes. Your eyes are horrible and your eyesight is gone. Dear goodness, inside your liver are maggots. Where is your voice? How come you don't have a voice?" To look at all these symptoms and realize there's decay, there's death, and then to only realize, "You know what the problem is? You're a zombie. You're as good as dead." What good is it for a zombie to go into the hospital to get diagnosed for problems? Do you see what I'm saying? Well, oftentimes there is an error by which we misdiagnose how far that chasm is. Our greatest plight, as my case to you today, is that we have no God. To be apart from the Lord is to have no life, and therefore the zombie analogy is appropriate. Scripture says in John 1, verses 1 through 4, that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and apart from him nothing came into being that has came into being." Verse 4, "But in him was life, and the life was the light of men." To be apart from Christ is to be a zombie. You're walking, but you are dead. Now I say this because what God does for us is he enables us to see this plight. And the reason why I bring this up is because I had the sweet opportunity to read all of their testimonies, and you are going to see this pattern where God has opened their eyes and given them the mercy to see, "I have this need." Some of them quickly saw as they were young. Some of them had to learn the hard way. They had to try, he's like, "Amen." They had to learn the hard way. They saw their depravity, they saw the darkness, and what they did was decided, "Well, then I've got to do something." What they did was they put forth more of their effort. What they did is they tried to put a band-aid on that decay. What they did is try to pick out the maggots. What they did is try, try to follow at least someone else's example for righteousness in their lives, only to realize, "I'm still chewing air." So here is my encouragement and challenge to you as I conclude this sermon and give it over to them. Don't make that error. If you realize you are in the kingdom of darkness, but there is a kingdom of light, you cannot demand that this king come over here and make your kingdom better. You cannot demand, "Let me still be king over this darkness," but can you make this kingdom any better by adding to it a little bit more light, by adding to it a little bit more purpose, by adding to it a little bit more value? That cannot be done. What does the gospel, what does it say? He says, "Let this completely, completely be broken." The individual who will come to Christ is going to say, "Lord, this kingdom is shot, and I am so broken I will lay down my crown. I will no longer be king over this dark, dark place. I'm not going to try to enter your kingdom of light still as a king. I'm going to lay this down and tell you, 'Lord, I cannot improve this. There's nothing to be salvaged. It is condemned.'" And so the scripture says that when you put faith in Christ, you're going to then join with him in his death, that your old man is completely done away. And that flesh that so bounded us is going to be condemned by Christ. Only so that what you're going to have is not simply improved, is not going to be simply repaired, but you're going to have absolute perfect value, perfect identity, perfect meaning because your life is found in the resurrected life of Christ. Amen? That is the Christian gospel. You are not going from kind of bad to kind of good. You're going to go from complete darkness to perfection in Christ. And that is the hope that they have, and that's the hope that they're going to share. Let's take a moment to pray and invite our first individual to come up and give their testimony. Lord God, we want to thank you so much that in your grace and in your mercies, you give to us revelation. You speak to us. You open our eyes and you convict our hearts. Thank you so much for that God. And we recognize Lord that that is your love and grace to us. Thank you so much Lord for the individuals here who are going to give their testimony. God, what we see is just an overflow of your mercies upon them. And I pray that with great gratitude in their heart, you will empower them to share of the work you have done in their lives. And for all of us here gathered, would you work in our heart that as we hear, we will unite with them in faith, we will sympathize with them and be all the more edified and refreshed. We thank you it's in Christ name we pray. Amen. So we have seven individuals who are going to be baptized today and they're going to come up now and give their testimony. Our first sister to share is Eunice. Let's give her a warm welcome. Hi, my name is Eunice and I attend UCI and I'll just start on my testimony. When I was younger, I went to a Christian school and I wasn't the brightest kid, but I made my way with the Garden of Eden.
