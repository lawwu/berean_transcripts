href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=135s">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as you guys know, we've been in the book of Romans for about three and a half years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=139s">00:02:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you looked at some of the questions that I posted up yesterday on Facebook, I asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=143s">00:02:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you to go and look at Romans chapter 1, 1 through 17 and compare it with the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=148s">00:02:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he's ending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=150s">00:02:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I asked you to do that is because Paul basically is ending the letter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=154s">00:02:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the same manner that he started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=156s">00:02:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, most of Paul's letters are written systematically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=159s">00:02:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He has a point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=160s">00:02:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the reason why I'm writing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=162s">00:02:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he has maybe, you know, four or five points he wants to make and then he concludes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=166s">00:02:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And Romans is no different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=167s">00:02:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though it's a long letter and it's been three and a half years since we started the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=171s">00:02:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">letter, if you look at the beginning of the letter, he kind of outlines that this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=175s">00:02:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he's going to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=177s">00:02:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end of it, you have very similar things that he says and then he kind of concludes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=182s">00:03:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it summarizing what he just said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=184s">00:03:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you look at it, if you took a look at it, you'll see that Paul begins Romans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=189s">00:03:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 1 through 17 about how the gospel is the power of God, how through the prophets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=195s">00:03:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the holy scriptures he made the gospel known, how he was going to bring the obedience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=199s">00:03:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of faith through the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=201s">00:03:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result of that, the gospel is to be proclaimed and then ultimately it establishes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=206s">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">God's glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=207s">00:03:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you'll see all the themes that are mentioned in chapter 1 repeated here in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=211s">00:03:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three verses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=214s">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What I want to do for the next couple of weeks is go through the list that I've just mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=218s">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that is repeated here, these five things that he says about the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=223s">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So today I'm going to be looking at the first two and then next week we'll be looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=226s">00:03:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the last three and then we'll conclude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=229s">00:03:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing he's talking about, the gospel is the outworking of God's power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=233s">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The gospel is Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=235s">00:03:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The gospel is the mystery revealed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=237s">00:03:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The gospel is the mystery to be preached and the gospel is the mystery to be obeyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=242s">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the last three we'll be dealing with next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=244s">00:04:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">First two we'll be dealing with today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=247s">00:04:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This part that we're looking at, the theologians typically call that a doxology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=252s">00:04:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what doxology basically is a short theological statement that is set in repetition or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=259s">00:04:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a concise form because it was important enough for the early church to memorize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=263s">00:04:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So a doxology oftentimes you'll find it in hymns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=266s">00:04:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll find the exact same wording in other letters and it's repeated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=270s">00:04:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason why we know that it's a doxology is because we know these phrases are used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=274s">00:04:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">repeatedly all throughout the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=278s">00:04:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it is a condensed version of theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=283s">00:04:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So every part of what he says, he says meaningfully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=286s">00:04:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that any other part of Book of Romans, anything else he says, he says randomly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=290s">00:04:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But in particular, this part of it was probably put to memory and maybe even sung in certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=298s">00:04:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">circles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=299s">00:04:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of like, you know, when we first go to school, everybody learned their ABCs through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=303s">00:05:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the ABC song.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2137s">00:35:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well it made a lot of sense because when I entered everything was made out of marble</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2143s">00:35:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I can speak to you softly and the person in the front, the person in the back would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2147s">00:35:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">no problem hearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2148s">00:35:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way that they had it was they would have whoever was preaching, not preaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2153s">00:35:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like this, they would have the person, it would be a

giving the sermon, would actually preach in the middle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304663086#t=2166s">00:36:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">not in
