to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=94s">00:01:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">part of chapter 15, and then chapter 16, you just kind of

href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=113s">00:01:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">done with all of his main teachings about justification, salvation by grace alone, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=118s">00:01:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the ramification of that, and what happened after that, and what should we hope for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=122s">00:02:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, we need to give a proper response to live our

chapter 15, he's kind of wrapping up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=133s">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is not to our benefit for us to skim through this process, because Apostle Paul,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=138s">00:02:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in this

<span class="t">he wrote the letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=145s">00:02:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we get a glimpse of who he is, we get a glimpse of his ministry, we get a glimpse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=150s">00:02:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of the early church and their activity and what that looked like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=154s">00:02:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we need to understand that Apostle Paul, this whole letter was written in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=159s">00:02:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">context of him preparing to go further out his ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=164s">00:02:44.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=168s">00:02:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">doing ministry somewhere between Jerusalem to Ilikriam, which is about a thousand mile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=173s">00:02:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">distance, and we know that Paul, in his official status, made about three separate journeys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=180s">00:03:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the trip alone, even if he wasn't planting churches and stayed there and was laboring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=187s">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and raising up leaders, even just visiting physically, that would have drained anybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=192s">00:03:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, just looking at his travel itinerary, it would have been enough for any human being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=197s">00:03:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at that and say, "Wow, this guy really traveled a lot."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=201s">00:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But in 10 years, he poured his life out and doing ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=205s">00:03:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now he says, because he's been so diligent, he's run out of places to preach the gospel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=210s">00:03:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not that every single individual heard the gospel, but the areas that he's been targeting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=214s">00:03:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">he's already finished, he's finishing up, and now he's trying to expand his ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=217s">00:03:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond Ilikriam to stop by Rome to get some support and move on to Spain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=223s">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the whole reason why he wrote this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=227s">00:03:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is in the context of his mission work, his ministry and preaching the gospel in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=232s">00:03:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">he writes this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=233s">00:03:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason why this is so, so important is because not only the book of Romans is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=239s">00:03:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">written in the context of mission work, the whole Bible is written in the context of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=244s">00:04:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pursuing sinners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=246s">00:04:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you study the Bible to find out how to have a healthy family, what does it mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=251s">00:04:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to manage your money well, how to raise your kids so that they love Christ, you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=256s">00:04:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=257s">00:04:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But all of those things are sub-points in the major, major theme of the Bible, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=262s">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is pursuing of sinners, being reconciled with the holy God, and how to get this gospel out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to the remotest part of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=269s">00:04:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So if that is not your paradigm, if that's not your commitment, you will not understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=276s">00:04:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what he is writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=278s">00:04:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It is no different than reading a book of 22 chapters and just kind of skimming through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=284s">00:04:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and taking a chapter here, a chapter there, and a chapter in the end, and then kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292811626#t=288s">00:04:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">just
