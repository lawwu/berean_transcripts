Then what I'd like to do is read our passage together over in verse 16 of chapter 3 down to verse 23. And it says, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, 'He is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness.' And again, the Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that they are useless. So then, let no one boast in men, for all things belong to you. Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all things belong to you. And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God." Okay. So, in that passage, if you guys can tell the flow of thought, he's still talking about the issue in the church of division. Okay? And in addressing this topic, man, he's used so many different types of arguments and different types of reasoning. Okay? So today, we're going to take a look at this portion as one segment in that larger argument. Okay? I want to start off by giving an interesting introduction. I'm currently living in my father-in-law's home, and that has proven to be quite the interesting thing. Thank goodness he's an extremely godly man. He's like an elder at his church. He's actually like a member of the Korean Presbyterian Synod in Southern California, and he's like a really authoritative, strong individual. So, whatever he says kind of goes. Now, you can imagine how that could create some, even though he is godly and even though he's extremely generous and kind, how that can create confusion, how that can create perhaps awkwardness and also a sense of, "I don't know what I'm supposed to do." You know? Hence, I'm looking for a place to go. I'm just kidding. It's been awesome living there, and again, they've been so generous. It's been amazing. But being that culturally, there's differences too. For example, the way that I grew up, my parents, they're like OG Korean, first generation, everything's old school. So, essentially, the hierarchy amongst parents and children is pretty, pretty severe. So, when they say, "No, this is the way it should be," you correcting them would be like, "How dare you?" You know? It'd be like that. Whereas, Bia, what's really weird about it is, you know, they're Korean, but they grew up in Brazil. So, it's just like a completely different environment. So, there's all kinds of confusions. For example, you know, obviously, if we go out and maybe I want to pay for it, but then the father says, "No." I have to decide, do I push the issue and be like, "No, no, no, I'll pay. I'm so thankful for what you've been doing. Let me pay for the thing." Or if he says, "No," should I be respectful and be like, "Okay, you pay for it." You know? Other times when certain things happen, Bia recently twisted her ankle. She couldn't do something and then she asked for help. I saw her dad get up, but then I want to get up because I'm her husband and it's kind of like, "What do I do?" You know? And so, my mind works extremely slow and my gears have to start going. So, I sit there and I'm like, "What's wrong with you?" And the reason why I'm bringing these scenarios up is because how do you decide what to do? You know? As a matter of fact, not in just those scenarios, but in different scenarios, there's always a question of how do I decide what to do in this context, right? And sometimes, especially if there are different role-playing figures in the scenario, it gets really complicated, right? Well, I talked to Bia about it one time and I said, "Sometimes I don't know what to do." And she just straight-up looked at me and said, "But you're my husband." I said, "Okay." You know? Like, that just kind of clarifies what she expects in the moment. And that totally makes sense, right? She stubs her toe or breaks her ankle, who should be the one running down to help her? Well, if she was a single lady, it would be her father. But, now that she's married, it should be me. Why? Because that's who I am. I bring that up because I think Apostle Paul, in trying to challenge the church, like, there are certain ways you should behave in the church, okay? And there are certain things you shouldn't be doing in the church. And a lot of it, his rationale or the way that he argues with the people of the church is, "Because this is who you are. Live up to who you are." And if you know, you guys read other epistles that he's written, the letters that he's written, and a lot of times he writes in that way. "Be who you are. Live up to your calling. Function, behave, believe according to what God has made you now." Right? And so it makes sense that from the beginning of the letter, how did he begin? "Come on, saints!" You know? You almost hear the frustration, but he begins with saying, "Saints, brothers!" And then so he'll start arguing. Well, this section to me is really one of those sections where he says, "Live up to who you are." And so he begins by saying, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." See that? So there's an emphatic point, him saying, "This is who you are. Think about it." So let's think. First section, little phrase, "You are the temple of God." Right? Now I want to just get this out of the way. When he says, "You are the temple of God," is it you? So it's like, "Hey, don't get that tattoo, because you're the temple of God." Or is it you, as in y'all? Y'all are the temple of God. So don't fight each other in the church. Don't do this and this and this stuff in the church. I don't know. So for you guys, what do you guys think? Just getting this out of the way of what's the more, I guess, best way to look at that? Plural or singular? I see him pointing. Plural. Okay. So how do you kind of conclude to, "Hey, I think he's talking about the plural here." Awesome. So you can look at the Greek. So here's the interesting thing, okay? So I personally believe that obviously sometimes I mention the Greek and I don't. I think it's good for us to realize obviously the Bible is written in Greek and we should go to the Greek because, number one, that's the way it was written. Number two, the Greek is a much more precise language. And because we believe in this inspiration and inerrancy of scripture, we believe that in the original manuscripts there's just no error. It's not going to mislead us. It's going to trick us. So jot this down just for your reference. There's a website called blueletterbible.com. You don't have to be a professor in Greek to use that because it just tells you, you look at a word and it'll do the whole parsing for you. Parsing just saying, it'll tell you what kind of word it is. Plural, singular, what case. Now, I don't think you should try to make huge theological movements from like one word or one Greek letter, all that kind of stuff. But it's good for us to know, okay? And we don't want to, again, make more than it is of it. But this is something good to know. The passage, yes, in the Greek it's plural, okay? And so not only that, but from the context we understand that he is addressing the church at large and he's addressing the church writing this letter saying, you guys have division in the church. You are the temple, okay? So in addressing the church together then, it helps us think about the analogy, right? And so my question to you is, what about this analogy then as a temple correlates to y'all, the church at large? What did you guys discuss at the beginning of that? Yes? >> >> Okay. >> >> Okay. >> >> Great. That's a great case for looking at the context and then how he's addressing the church. Awesome. What other things did you kind of deduce about, okay, how is this analogy working? Meaning, what elements of the temple or the church is he correlating to say, hey, you're the temple? What sort of things did you guys talk about in your groups? How about calling on somebody? Hmm. Jen Chung. Okay. Thank you. All right. Anything else you guys want to highlight? Okay. Let's do some more observation and then we're going to try to look at this stuff, okay? The next question I have is, okay, thinking about this whole temple analogy, for me, meditating about this analogy is going to make for a lot of application. It's going to make for a lot of evaluation of how we function as a church, what we do, right? And so kind of giving more detail to that, I want to ask you, when Apostle Paul is writing to this church, remember at the beginning I said this church has a mixture, okay? There's probably a good presence of Jews. There's obviously being in Corinth, it has a great presence of Gentiles and whatnot. But how would the Jews think about the temple when Apostle Paul brings this up and kind of emphatically says, well, you guys are the temple. And he's now talking to this, you know, new covenant after Christ church, but he's pointing back and saying, you're the temple. How would the Jews perceive that? What are some of the first impressions and thoughts that they would have? Aspect of holiness. Okay. So definitely for like a Jewish, Jewish individual, they're thinking about temple. Everything has to be holy. Everything has to be consecrated. Everything has to be cleansed. Right? So definitely a Jew would be thinking like this place is holy. Okay. What else? What kind of things would they, would they think of it when they think of the temple? God's presence, right? Because historically, where do you go to meet God? The temple. You don't go on a random place. As a matter of fact, if you did, you get judged. You don't go whenever you want to. You don't go to different hilltops. You don't go just make a little ditch at your home. You have to make that pilgrimage to the temple. Why? Because that's where God has ordained to meet his people. Right? So that's a lot of interesting things we can, we can think about. And so here, um, this is what I'm talking about. If you were to take the time to meditate as to he's building a metaphor. Now, typically anytime the scriptures use a metaphor, we can't necessarily sit there and make all kinds of extrapolations from one metaphor. Why? Because typically the metaphor is trying to prove a point. A parable, a story, an illustration is typically trying to what? Prove a point. Right? So here I believe there's a sense in which he says you're the temple and the spirit dwells in you. Okay? And that's highlighting a point. But first I want to ask in what way does the spirit dwell in us? Well, let me have some of you guys read some of the cross references that are listed there. If I can have Isaac, can you look up first Peter chapter two verse five? Andy, can you look up the next one? Ephesians 22. Okay. And then Alex, a kindle. Can you look up second Corinthians six 16 Jason, can you look up Romans chapter eight, first nine and 11 and then going down the line, maybe 10. Can you look up second Timothy one 14 and then Martin, if you can look up Ezekiel chapter 37 verse 27 as they're looking that up, I want to encourage you guys when you do your Bible studies, you know, there's a lot you can learn just from like a Bible that just has references and you don't have to, you know, buy all the commentaries and you don't have to buy all the latest like study Bibles. Why? Because sometimes you're studying a passage and you look up other areas in the scriptures that teach the same thing. You look up cross references and it helps just a lot. Okay. So starting from Isaac. Okay. So if we were to summarize that, I would say spiritual house for worship. Sorry, I know the line's kind of short, spiritual house for worship. Is that sufficient? Right? Like who are we? He says, you're being built up like a spiritual house for worship. You're a bunch of priests offering up sacrifices. Right? Kind of interesting that Peter would also give old Testament analogy for what we're doing in the new Testament church. Next one. Ephesians 22 or 222. Okay. So dwelling place of God. Okay. The church has being built up. Is it built up? You know, sometimes we use the analogy that the church is the extension, the church is the vehicle, the church is the hand of God, church is the ministry, the program. We use all different types of terms to describe the church. Here it's emphasizing this fact that God is building a dwelling place for his presence. Next one. Second Corinthians. Who did I ask? Alex. Okay. What version are you reading? ESV? Okay. You guys can write in there again. Holy temple. Just temple. Next one. Romans eight. Okay. Thank you. So this passage we're talking about dwelling. Like how does the spirit dwell in you? And here, rather than the collective, he is talking about the individual. So you can write dwells individually. Okay. The spirit dwells individually as well. Okay. Second Timothy chapter one verse 14. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you. So it says by the spirit, you guard the good deposit. So in many ways, this idea of dwelling is also protective. Okay. So you can write as a shelter or just protective. Okay. And the last one. Ezekiel. Okay. Thank you. That passage in Ezekiel is a pretty astounding one. It's talking about the new covenant and the change of heart that God is going to enact. Now I know that was kind of a, somewhat of a tedious exercise, like looking up different verses, but for me, I just want us to sit and meditate and think about this truth. That God so desired this emphatic truth to be repeated so many times, which is that the spirit dwells in you, right? The spirit dwells in you. So meditate about this, that the spirit dwells in you in a sense in which through the offering, through the worship, through, through who we are, the spirit dwells in you as a, as a sanctifying, Holy presence. The spirit dwells in us collectively that we talked about already as a temple, but individually, the spirit dwells in order to protect and guard. The spirit dwells just to emphasize this point. His presence is with us, right? Okay. So as we think about that, I want you to think back to this idea again, to a Jew, the temple meant presence of God. So by ramification, what would it, what would it translate to if they brought unholy animal, if they brought sin into the temple, how would they view that? Again, I'm at, sometimes I just ask obvious questions that it's just, you know, you know, the answer just want someone to say it, you know, how would someone view bringing anything unholy into the temple for a Jew? Yeah. Like flat out just defilement, right? Something like completely sacrilege and, and towards God, they would feel what? Sense of this like, wow, this is blasphemous, you know, they would have a sense of, oh my gosh, we're offending God, you know, and just meditate on that for a second. Apostle Paul is bringing an analogy and this analogy or this metaphor is supposed to have its effect. You're a temple. Remember all that your fathers, forefathers had gone through? Remember all that was taught to your forefathers through the law? Remember all the experiences? Remember the people who offered strange sacrifices? Remember the people who brought in prostitutes to the temple? What did God do? You are this temple and it is emphatic point is the Holy Spirit is in there among you, in you, therefore, therefore what? It must be holy. And so to me, the metaphor and how he builds it up is it all makes sense. It all connects. And so as you meditate on that, think, think about that, the ramifications of the church being the temple. Okay. And let that be a moment of just this kind of explosion of self-evaluation, evaluation, even over our church and application right away. Like if we truly believe we're the church, I mean, sorry, we're the temple. The church is a temple of God, the primary place in which God manifests his presence. What sort of place should we be? You know, that's what Paul's getting at. Be who you are. You are the temple. And so he gives this warning. Number four, which is verse 17. If any man destroys the temple, God will destroy him. Now he is speaking metaphorically and stuff like that, but the reality is we do do stuff to destroy the temple, destroy the church. Aside from what we've been talking about the whole time, which is causing division, what are the more specific and tangible ways do we harm our local body, our church? I think I might have asked this before on a discussion question. Let's just talk about it a little bit. Okay. He says, I give you this warning. If any man destroys the church, think about this. How do we harm the church and the people in the church? Yes? Okay. Okay. Thank you. So he said, we've been talking about a lot of it before. It's all kind of rooted in your envy and strife and stuff like that. And then it's kind of breeds all this other stuff we do. But I just wanted to, again, for the sake of following his trail of thought, it's like, if any man destroys the temple, you know, and essentially he's like rebuking them. It's like, you're destroying the temple. But what sort of things do we do in our modern day, perhaps just identifying some of those things that we harm the church? Gossip. Okay. Gossip and strife. Yes. Disconnecting. You guys hear what he said, right? That's really good. You know, for me, I think about the Hebrews passage that do not neglect, you know, gathering together. And there's this idea of just kind of neglecting the church. And I remember, you know, being told many, many times that, you know, we don't, there's nothing that just stays the same. You're either decaying, you're either like decreasing or you're increasing, you know, it's just nothing really ever stays the same. So you neglect it. It's not just staying the same. It's decaying, you know, that kind of stuff. Great. Other things? Becoming lukewarm. Pride. Okay. Compromising. There's a lot, you know, if you think about each letter that Apostle Paul writes, sometimes he addresses some of these issues. He addresses the issues also of just simply judging each other, prematurely judging each other, judging each other with arbitrary standards, hypocritical standards, all kinds of stuff, you know. There's a lot of things that can happen in the church where we can kind of destroy both the integrity, both the standard, the fellowship, and every aspect. Remember that whole analogy of the building to me, it's like, yeah, it is a building, you know. There's infrastructure, there's like, you know, outside stuff, there's programs and all that kind of stuff. So think about that a little bit. Yes?  Great questions. Yeah. So that's kind of what we're, um, thank you for asking the question. Good segue. Okay. We're going to move forward. And Rachel asked a really good question. So we're talking about this stuff and I just asked, like, just throw out any examples of stuff that we do to destroy the church. But how are we defining destroy? That's a great question. Okay. Now, in order to answer this question, this is another point at which we kind of have to understand the term destroy. Right? And this is where it's kind of good again to go to websites like blueletterbible.com, biblestudytools.com also gives you Greek and stuff like that. Again, I want to give you a warning. What will happen is it'll give you a word. So it'll give you the English and the Greek word. And you want to click on it. It'll give you like a gloss of definitions and the gloss of definitions for the term destroy includes everything from ruin, corrupt, injure or hurt. Okay. Now, the danger we can have is, Oh, I'll pick one that I think kind of fits, you know, but you have to kind of put it in context. So this is why I asked you a question. Do you think God will destroy a Christian? Because there's a sense in which, so there's the church that's being metaphorically spoken of as a temple. And then there's a guy who ends up either one of those glosses, ruining, destroying, hurting, injuring the church. But in like manner, God is going to do the same thing to him. What do you think about that? So context sometimes will help you kind of put parameters as to what that term might mean. Any thoughts? Okay. Well, in thinking about this, I'm going to do this. I'll leave it to you to work out your faith with fear and trembling and study that a little bit. What does God mean when he says I will destroy him? What does it mean that we destroy the temple? Obviously it has a negative connotation. We do a lot of stuff that has negative impact influence on the church, right? And we have to be wary of it. I'm going to move on to this next point. Why? Why does God make this threat? I asked, is this a legitimate threat? Of course it is. God says in the scriptures, it just says flat out, if you destroy the temple, God will destroy him. Right? Is that a legitimate threat? Yes, I do believe it is a legitimate threat. Not a threat, a warning because it's not just an empty threat. It's going to happen. If an individual is hurting that precious thing for which he sent his son, that precious thing to which he has raised his under shepherds and that precious things to which he has given structure and he's going to ensure its success. If any man tries to thwart that plan of God, if any man tries to destroy that church, what do you think God will do? He's giving fair warning. But in this passage, what does he say? He says, for the temple of God is holy. And you can read that for as though it's basically saying because. Because the temple of God is holy and that is what you are, that is why God is taking so seriously any attack, any defilement, any deconstructive efforts towards the church, God is going to take incredibly seriously. And so this is one of the ramifications that we're seeing. This is one of the ramifications that we're seeing. If we think about this fact, if we truly believe the church to be a temple, how careful should we be? We should be as careful as those who believe God will. Yes, all right. Now we haven't defined necessarily what destroy means, but the fact of the matter is God is going to give a just repercussion for the kind of destructive work an individual does. Right? In my mind, God is always just and God is one who is going to give a just recompense for what takes place in the church. And that's what I talked about the last week on Sunday, right? So think about that. If we believe truly the church to be the temple, how should we behave? All right. Any questions so far about those first verses? Yes. Although it doesn't make sense, I do believe it can include Christians. So that gives you a hint for me. I don't believe when he says destroy, he means like destroy as an utterly ruin or like destroy as in like there's a for us, we believe there are people in the church that look like Christians, but they're not. And in terms of destroying them, then God will in kind of final judgment reveal who they are and they're not going to be saved. The reason being is because again, there is this reality that the division that's happening now from the division, Apostle Paul does not automatically judge and conclude you guys are not Christian, but rather he still calls them saints and says, I'm very convinced of it. I'm thankful for it, but you guys are behaving very fleshly. So can that exist for a genuine Christian is struggling with the stain of his sin and he is acting like a man in the flesh, it can happen. I think that's a very possible way to think about it. Yeah. You know, there's a sense in which, um, you know, individuals who it's still, it's to me, it's, it's always a, remember that one week I wrote that phrase, just desserts and people had a weird, hard time understanding what I was saying. Just desserts is just a way of saying that whatever the crime, the judgment always fits with God. God has a sense of poetic justice and God has a sense of this giving to people exactly what they need, you know, and so they deserve a guy sitting there. He wants to inflate his ego and he just wants to look real nice. What ends up happening? He ends up looking completely opposite and he just gets completely humiliated. You know, remember Eve, she wants to overthrow and overpower the husband. God says, you're going to rule. Oh, you're going to be ruled over by your husband. The husband is going to rule over you. You know, remember Jacob, he's deceives. Who does he get deceived by? LeBron. And then now he's deceived and Jacob's saying, you know, why'd you deceive me? And then he has to go work many, many years for the wife that he wants. God always has a sense of poetic justice and he kind of, you know, matches the crime. I think in many ways, sometimes that happens. When God in church sticks up his big old, you know, head thinking he's all that, God's going to be like right on top of that, right on top of that head. And so, yeah.  It's true. Yeah. I guess you're right. I wouldn't limit it to say, okay, destruction only means humbling or like slight disciplines or whatnot. Could it mean physical death? Yeah. Could it mean physical sickness and come to a sense of ruin? Yeah. So, okay.  Right. Okay. Okay. Good questions. Yeah. And so thinking about this, for me, I feel like learning about this as a perspective changer, isn't it? This is one of those like China of have your mind frame, like how you think and function in the church. And that's what apostle Paul is doing. You are the temple and God cares so much about this place, these people, you dividing it and causing fractions. Like it's, it's not without consequences, you know, it's a frame of thinking. All right. So in so doing, I'm going to jump into the next section. If you notice in your Bibles, there's going to be probably a, um, you know, verse 16 through 17 and verse 18 has that bolded number that kind of shows you that in the Greek it's a start of a new paragraph. Is it completely divided? The, that section in the next section? No, I still think he's having the people examine their perspective, but he's really driving home the point. So in chapter three, he's giving a couple summaries, a couple of those exert exhortation points. That's going to really move the people to feel, you know, that conviction like, Oh, this is a temple. I shouldn't be prideful. I shouldn't be, you know, doing this and that. And that's kind of how I read the last section of chapter three. Okay. And that's why I asked you highlight some of the main verbs. Did you guys do that? Okay. Be in the practice of doing that, especially commands like jot those down in the Bible. It's if it's command in the Bible, sometimes you just have to sit there and be like, I'm not going to sit here and try to define, okay, what does this mean? How do I define it? What are the examples? I'm just going to read it and ask myself, did I obey? Sometimes I do that, you know, not to clutter, not to confuse the scriptures, but some of it's just really, really clear. So that's the command I highlighted in bold. I like put arrows on it and I say, do I obey that? It's a good practice. Okay. But let me begin with this first 18 through 20. It says, let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become foolish so that he may become wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written. He is the one who catches the wise and their craftiness. And again, the Lord knows the reasoning of the wise that they are useless. Okay. So I want to ask you, what's the plain command here? How would you state like, okay, someone's reading this last segment. I want to know what is the command of God here? How would you summarize it for you? You know, for them? Okay. Good. Be foolish. If you think you're wise. Okay. Is there any other kind of command sounding verb? Great. So you got two fold. The first fold is don't deceive yourself. Okay. Don't be deluded. Second part, become foolish. Okay. So he says, you know, um, he's giving this picture of the types of individuals we are not to become. He's giving a command by way of saying, basically, let us not deceive ourselves. Okay. And in so thinking about that, I want you guys to think about this whole issue. If I can ask you guys, you know, sometimes it's good to do this too, is kind of picture that man. Okay. Picture that man who is somewhat deluded because he just thinks way too highly of himself. You know, um, picture that guy whose self esteem is, you know, as big as the entire room and there's space for nobody else. Okay. Picture that guy who thinks he's incredibly wise. Yeah. And, and describe the way that he thinks. How does a man who is like that, how does he think? Cause, uh, in, in picturing that sometimes it helps us if the command is don't do this in picturing that man and it helps us, uh, and don't put a name to it and be like, Oh yeah, that guy at church. I'm just saying like picture the guy in general. All right. Just think about it for a second. How would that individual think? I mean, I wrote down a bunch of statements. I was like, I pictured him and I started writing down some statements that he would say and um, yeah. All right. Thought about it. Throw some out to me. How does a cocky, arrogant guy who thinks he knows everything, what, in what way does he think, what sort of things does he typically say? What sort of things does he typically do? I know I'm asking for kind of like a broad general thing, but again, how would that individual think? Talk about themselves a lot. I did this and did you know I did that? And when I was your age I was like this and if I were you, I would do that and okay do so maybe you do that what else would he say and think he won't listen to anybody else okay it's like no no no no no no no no because people off jumps in what else not teachable okay yeah always thinks he actually knows better it's like yeah but you know what else trust me trust me I know what's best you know no just listen just okay yeah sometimes we have some of these things and you know some of the things that I sometimes want to catch myself before I say this stuff like oh they're not listening to me like nobody ever listens to me you know you know complaining about how nobody you know like how everybody's so stupid or how nobody you know has reason anymore like so sometimes I'm like nobody has common sense anymore gosh you know and you know is that is that the kind of practical statement I want to say where by far obviously I have common sense but nobody ever thinks like me you know stuff like maybe people who come in and they just want to teach like I'm here to disciple people you know like who wants to get discipled I've got four slots come on by and I'll include you into my little posse there are people like that they come in they don't want to get discipled by the church they want to come in they want to teach yeah so there are other stuff yeah yeah that one's really good and I think to tell you honestly I think that's primarily what Apostle Paul is getting at when he says like you guys rest on your worldly wisdom you know it's your knowledge and your experience that dictates for you what you think about God it's your knowledge and your experience that dictates for you what you think about church so the pastor might be teaching one when you're like no no no that's not how I learned it or that's not what I experienced so that's not what I think they're just not willing to say my whole entire experience might be wrong compared to scripture they're just not willing to say that why because they have a sense of pride you know this is the guy who thinks he is wise this is a guy who needs who needs to become first foolish in order to be wise okay and to tell you honestly I have to be careful because those type of thoughts that way of thinking those types of attitudes exist you know and I try to catch myself before I say something like that yeah and so scripture teaches us in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 it's a good passage for us 1st Corinthians 10 12 therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall that in our own estimation we're so confident that we're absolutely right that in our own estimation I can't possibly be wrong you know take heed because you're just gonna fall you're not aware of your weaknesses and the people who said to me plenty of times if I said hey you guys when you're dating relationship be careful because that's so dangerous you know even the godliest of men and the godliest of women who are really really careful fell it's like don't worry about it don't worry about it arrogant little but there's a sense of like that's not you know you're not playing humble to think that oh we're okay you're being arrogant to think you know I don't have that weakness an individual who is wise is very well aware that a well aware of their weakness of an individual who is wise and humble is very well over there of their sin how susceptible they are they're absolutely aware that without the Holy Spirit's presence without discipline of the word and prayer and God and his word but they're absolutely weak those are the marks of the humble one so God repeats these ideas that we've mentioned before so I'm not gonna belabor them but that the wisdom of the world is absolutely foolish before God compared to God's revelation compared to God's truth compared to the way God thinks compared to how God has planned how God has ordained things to be the craftiness of the wise is nothing God has already caught them the reasoning of the wise are useless God has already observed how they reason right so his exhortation is so all you guys sitting here thinking is wise to elevate a human leader and say I pledge allegiance to Paul who planted this church you know and I am of Paul those of you who thinks is wise to do that somehow thinks is glorious that it's gonna elevate you he says let no one boast in men so I'm reading verse 21 through 23 for all things belong to you whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all things belong to you and you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God to me these verses are a little bit confusing but there again perspective changers there are like ways of thinking about the world right and I want to ask you this question the command is pretty clear don't boast in men for all things belong to you that's where all the sudden is like well till he took me off guard I got a little confusing so okay I get this idea don't be cocky don't be prideful don't you know put men on a pedestal because in in the end that's just in our own pride our own fanciful thinking of like want to be like him I want to be glorified like him right but his rationale is hard to comprehend because he says for all things belong to you okay all things belong to you obviously we have to ask the question what does that mean all things belong to you okay not all things belong to me right now and how are we to understand how that connects with us not boasting in men that's another good question right so I'm looking at it for two parts one he says don't both the men for all things belong to you first question what is that what does it mean for not what does it mean to have all things belong to me secondly how does that connect to don't boast in men let's take a look at some of the details here he says don't boast in men for all things belong to you and then he starts describing describing them and I categorized I categorized those just those items that belong in the entire category of all things first you have some leaders and they are Paul Apollos and Cephas so you can write those in the blank then you have powers and possessions the world and all that it possesses life or death okay you also have time things present things to come right so for me I just kind of categorize it like that those categories are not ordained by God so I might change them but essentially that's kind of the way it feels like right he's like hey don't boast in men because you own everything you see these leaders they're yours you see that all the world and all that it possesses you know yours life the power of life power over death yours time now in the future things to come yours what is he saying how does it even belong to you do you guys perhaps have any ideas as to how that would all work now that's a hard question to answer you guys can just take a crack at it how does that work you got a good one I just know okay all right how about yeah oh I forgot your name already hey John that's right same last name Jonathan all right I think the Bible talks about excellence you guys hear his question so you would agree with MacArthur in his commentary that in a sense we own it all why because with Christ we are heirs we're heirs with Christ and there's a sense in which kind of already but not yet into the future we're gonna possess the world you know so by position by standing like already now as an heir I'm entitled to everything okay and so if you think about it that way this kind of places you on a position where it's like what are you shooting for when you're competing with each other when you already own the world right so one can think of the logic like that it's like don't sit there elevating men like you fancifully and why do we elevate like basketball star superstars and stuff like that and a lot of times because what we vicariously win through them we lift them up fancifully thinking I just want to dunk it so bad you know I want to shoot that shot or whatnot and it's a lot of this fantasy of like vicariously you are winning through them their glory is your glory when you elevate people like that you know but if you own the world like if you are the heir of the world like what is that you know but you know there's actually other ways to look at this kind of slight differences of nuance and other commentators would differ on the position on this any other ideas how does all that belong to you and how does it connect with don't boast and men yes okay uh-huh okay good you know that's an excellent one if another commentator would say that you know I'm not a fan of the way you're talking about it but I'm not a fan of the way you're talking about it but I'm not a fan of the way you're talking about it but I'm not a fan of the way you're talking about it but I'm not a fan of the way you're talking about it but I'm not a fan of the way you're
