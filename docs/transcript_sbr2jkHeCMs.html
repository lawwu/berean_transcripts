Let's make sure to run that back. I wanted to encourage you guys with a specific meditation and thought, and I'll read a simple verse that you know well and pray.</p><p>It comes from Matthew chapter six, verse 33, and it says, "But seek first his kingdom "and his righteousness, "and all these things will be added to you." Let's take a moment to pray. Father God, as we together saw all those photos of our church community, our spiritual family, we feel so blessed that because of what you've provided, the church is not just simply something that we established together.</p><p>We know, God, you're building it, and therefore we get to enjoy being a part of the fellowship growing together in your name. And so for every blessing we have here, we thank you so much. And we also pray, God, that more and more intentionally, every single one of us would continue to live our day with a great purposefulness and a heart's intent to continue to build your church, to continue to establish your will, and to follow after all of your instructions for our lives.</p><p>We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name, amen. Now, with that, there were so many different activities at church, and I think one of the blessings that we have is we have then, as the church grows, many opportunities to engage. A lot of different avenues for us to connect and then keep ourselves very busy, which is great, but it presents, in of itself, a new challenge.</p><p>And as you'd expect, the new challenge is, which ones do I choose? And what I want you guys to think about is the topic of priorities. That famous passage that we just read in Matthew 6, it gives us this priority that we must seek the kingdom of God first.</p><p>To help us think about this, I wanna say that sometimes it is very, very difficult for us to keep some of our priorities straight and in order. We're very grateful for a lot of the blessings and opportunities we have, but staying focused is actually a massive challenge in our lives.</p><p>And, per example, I know there are a lot of college students with us. In college, every time the end of the year rolls around, the schedule gets so busy. You're cramming for tests, you're putting together, you know, how are you gonna get your assignments done? You still have plans to make for, you know, once the semester is done, et cetera, and you may show up to a study hall, and once you arrive, distractions all around you.</p><p>On your left, there's a bunch of people playing ping pong, and you say to yourself, I do need to get my blood flowing, so you go and play a little couple of ping pong. And then after you play ping pong, you're like, oh, I did kind of work up an appetite, so over there on your right, there's like a buffet.</p><p>And then so you walk over there and you grab snacks, and have you met those people who grab the snacks and take it with them to their study table? That was me. And so what ends up happening is you're studying, but actually, you're just having mealtime. You finish the whole bag of snacks, and then you feel kind of nasty, so you're like, oh, I need a break from my eating.</p><p>And then so you go over to take a break, and you see an old friend, and then after seeing your old friend, you realize, oh my goodness, me and my friend had this burning question for Pastor Nate. Where is he? You go find him in his office. You bother him for a little while, and then you realize it's two in the morning, and you're like, oh my goodness, I need to go home and study.</p><p>So you go home and study, but then et cetera, et cetera, and the story goes on. You know this, yes? I'm not saying it's all of you. It was more so me, okay? And what you realize at the end of that is I came to do one thing, but I ended up doing six, right?</p><p>And I know I am in some sense poking fun at the collegians, but as a matter of fact, you know well, as you observe mankind, that every single one of us, we come to do one thing, and then we end up doing seven. What's more, it's not so far from the college life where just the simple necessities of food, what do I want to eat?</p><p>Just the simple necessities of break, leisure, needing a break from my work, these are some of the things that distract us through our lives. It's not just your college career. So I think that for all of us, the difficulty and problem is not that you don't know what your priority is.</p><p>You know you should be working, laboring for the glory of God. You should be praying and prioritizing knowing the Lord and making him known through evangelism, amen? You want to be faithful in your home, you want to be faithful in your church, amen? Those are things you've heard many, many times.</p><p>The difficulty is keeping those priorities straight. And why is it so hard? And it may be because there are so many different good, fun activities all around us and we're just trying to squeeze in seven. Now, the scriptures gives us another possible reason and it's very, very convicting and I just wanted to make sure to share that with you and have us think about it.</p><p>Why is it so difficult for us to keep focused and our priorities in line? We'll turn again to your Bible. Turn to Matthew chapter six. I'm gonna be reading from verse 25 down to verse 34. And it says, "For this reason I say to you, "do not be worried about your life, "as to what you will eat or what you will drink, "nor for your body as to what you will put on it.</p><p>"Is not life more than food "and the body more than clothing? "Look at the birds of the air, "that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, "and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. "Are you not worth much more than they? "And who of you, by being worried, "can add a single hour to his life?</p><p>"And why are you worried about clothing? "Observe how the lilies of the field grow. "They do not toil nor do they spin. "Yet I say to you that not even Solomon, "in all his glory, clothed himself like one of these. "But if God so clothes the grass of the field, "which is alive today and tomorrow "is thrown into the furnace, "will he not much more clothe you?</p><p>"You of little faith. "Do not worry then, saying, what will we eat? "And what will we drink? "Or what will we wear for clothing? "For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things. "For your heavenly Father knows "that you need all these things. "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, "and all these things will be added to you.</p><p>"So do not worry about tomorrow, "for tomorrow will care for itself, "each day as enough trouble has enough trouble of its own." So when we take a look at this passage, it gives to us this explanation, which is my point one, that we have a difficult time keeping our priorities because we worry way too much to stay focused.</p><p>This passage, which is interesting, again, my guess is you've heard this commandment so many times, to seek first the kingdom of God. But did you know that in context, he is saying this as a solution to the problem, and the problem is that we are beset with anxiety and worry constantly, even especially for the stuff of our daily necessities.</p><p>So what's really interesting is this text tells us the reason why we are losing track of the things we ought to be doing is because you worry. And what's really interesting, that the highlight and the prime examples that Jesus gives are such basic things. Again, earlier, I wasn't necessarily taking a shot at the Collegians, but I mentioned about food because he uses that as a primary example as to what we're constantly worried for, right?</p><p>That our basic necessity is this. It says, "Do not be worried about your life, "what you will eat or what you will drink." And then secondly, the second example is still more, it says, "Your body, what you will put on it, "what you will wear, and basically how your body will look." So as you think about this, and I was meditating, I was very humbled by this text, right?</p><p>That just simply the care for how I look and how I appear can get me so distracted from my priorities? Absolutely. Now, I could maybe rationalize and say that I don't really care about how I look anymore. I've 100% accepted the fact that I'm not much to look at, so I don't care about what I wear.</p><p>I 100% buy my clothes at Costco. And all of you guys who wear Puma socks on the discount bundle, you're godly, okay? I'm just kidding, okay? I mean, we would think that we would be so mature as to move past what we struggled with when we were teens, caring so much about brand names and how we look.</p><p>But as a matter of fact, if you look at the industry statistics of how much money is being spent in America on cosmetics and appearance, it's wild. That annually, something like $35 billion is used on cosmetics. So many different types of products are out there. I mean, I could tell you, yes, I kind of don't care, but on the flip side, I do.</p><p>All of a sudden, I find myself spending money on, this is kind of a strange open confession, like $25 for a bottle of hair growth shampoo. It's crazy. Another $25 for a little bottle of digestive enzymes. It's wild. Why am I saying this? It's because the passage is humbling.</p><p>And to take it even further, if you noticed, in the passage, he talks about how for this reason, do not worry. And the reason was you cannot serve two masters was the verse right before this. It is to our deception to think that Satan has to go super far and he has to devise the greatest scheme to knock you off your horse.</p><p>No, he could just make you worry about what you're going to eat. Remember, at this time, the vast majority of people did have a difficult time making ends meet. And they live day to day. They live paycheck to paycheck, so to speak, yes? And in that kind of situation, worry, anxiety, how am I going to make sure I take care of everybody, myself, my family, et cetera?</p><p>And the struggle to do what we think everybody else is doing and how we look as compared to everybody else. That alone can make our priorities so skewed and muddy. And that's why the scriptures are chock full of commandments for us, for you and me. Do not worry. Cast your anxieties on Christ.</p><p>Be on the alert, be sober. And there's so many scriptures that tell you stop being afraid, but rather be strong, be courageous, amen? Why? Because that alone could cause us to be derailed from our purpose. So I took a moment to think about this, and I want to ask you this question.</p><p>For you tonight, as you think about this year, and then looking into the next year, what are the biggest worries that have been determining your decisions? What are some of the biggest worry that have been taking the biggest places in terms of the real estate of your mind and your heart?</p><p>What are some of the things that are causing you to think so much about whether it's your job, right? Yes, you will have to work incredibly hard in your life like you're serving the Lord himself, but we should not worry, amen? Are you super worried about your children? Yes, you and I are called to be faithful parents, exemplifying the parenthood of our Lord.</p><p>But do not worry, even about the kids. Are you worried about the future? Yes, you're supposed to prepare, and be wise, and be even wiser than the ants. But do not worry. Why? Because that worry is going to cause us to be led astray. And I thought about what is it that I worry about.</p><p>And I did come to my own conclusion that it is this worry I don't have time to get to all the important things. I know I want to pray, I know I want to evangelize, I want to take care of the flock of the church, I want to take care of my wife, I want to take care of my kids, I want to meet the people who are sick, and I want to meet the people who are da-da.</p><p>And the list goes on. And don't get me wrong. You guys know that, yes, the pastors are busy. I am busy. The thing is, I am incredibly grateful because our church people, you guys, are incredibly considerate of our time. But on the flip side, I want to use all of it.</p><p>I have no issue with people asking to meet up, and et cetera, because I want to use all of it. But as I took time to reflect, does that mean I don't have this worrisome angst in my heart? Like, Lord, there's not enough time to do everything I want to do.</p><p>Is there not in me this desire? Like, God, I wish there was just like five more hours in the day. Why'd you make it only 24? Come on, you know? Or just asking in constant-- and I realized this was actually a constant request in my heart when I prayed, is I asked God to make me faster, stronger, et cetera, et cetera, and more effective so that everything would just happen.</p><p>Do you know what I mean? And so what I'm sharing with you is that I had this angst in my heart. And in the end, it was just worry that I can't do everything that I want to do. And then this passage tumbled me. Why? Because Jesus asked a question.</p><p>If you, too, are worried that you don't have enough time and there is this complaint in your heart, Jesus said, who of you, by worrying, can add a single hour to your life? Let's answer that. Nobody. And no matter how much we try, we can't even add a single minute.</p><p>And that was so convicting for me. Why? Because in the same way that I cannot complain to God and say, God, why don't you give me more money? If you gave me more money, that could have served you harder and better and stronger. That sounds so weird, right? In the same vein, I can't look at God and say, God, how come you didn't give me enough time?</p><p>If you gave me more time and you gave me faster reading skills and faster typing skills and et cetera, et cetera, then I would have, what, glorified you more? No. We have this conviction. God has given to us everything he deemed necessary. Amen? God gave me what he thought was wise, enough time by which, by his grace, he knew what I could handle.</p><p>As humbling in one sense, in another sense, that gives me incredible peace. Our God, this past year, has given me and to you all by his sovereign hand. Amen? Let's remember that from this passage. As what is proper in his sight, as what is good in his wisdom, God has given to me all.</p><p>And if I ever dare complain for more, he might ask me, but how have you prioritized with what I've already given you? How have you made sure that the blessings of community, the blessings of your energy and your strength and the time that I've already given you, how have you prioritized it?</p><p>And in this way, I believe and trust God, that he knows and he gives, period. That leads me to my second point. We have to trust him. And moving a bit more quickly into the second point, this is the logic of the passage. If there is another convicting point from this passage, it is telling us, look.</p><p>Look with your eyes. The birds of the air, they don't have to scurry around. But the Lord, the Heavenly Father feeds them. And look at the lilies. They're clothed better than King Solomon. So even though the Gentiles, they look everywhere in which way for these things, you have a Heavenly Father who knows and who gives.</p><p>This is the confidence of every Christian, amen? What a wonderful promise. What a beautiful, beautiful statement when God says you are more than birds. You're more than the grass and lilies. Do you trust that I will give according to my sovereign hand? And again, I want to make a point of this and say there is a quick, quick thought that we could have, which is I know what God is saying, that if I seek his kingdom, he will provide.</p><p>True, 100% true. But does that mean that every single Christian who has ever trusted in him will actually, in fact, have enough food, have enough clothes, and will never die of starvation? The answer is no. Many Christians have suffered. And it's Jesus himself who has said that he has no nest.</p><p>He's got no-- foxes have holes. He doesn't even have a place to rest his head. And he has looked at us and every single disciple is not greater than his master. Expect that you will suffer in ways probably worse. So what is he actually saying? It's not so much about receiving the things that the Gentiles look for.</p><p>It's more about transcending that to receive his kingdom. Amen? And so with the time I have, I want to make sure to drive this point home. In verse 33 when it says, "But seek his kingdom and his righteousness." The priority is God's kingdom. The priority is his character, his righteousness.</p><p>And for those of you guys who are warlords, this is God's promise to you. As you look into the next year-- and maybe some of you guys are sitting here worried about your careers because you feel like you have no direction. Many of you guys are sitting here worried about your family members because there has been drama and the bad kind of drama.</p><p>When we seek his kingdom, you will worry a lot less. Amen? When you make your life first and foremost about his character, you know you're at the center of his will because God has said, it is my will, your sanctification. 1 Thessalonians 4. What's more, the stuff that we've been learning about the church, that in God's program, he desires for us to be a source of refreshment edification for the body.</p><p>Bless the Lord for this church. That is part of God's will. And you know that it is God's will and his priority that we be lights in his dark, dark generation where he has made you to be a city on a hill and you are not supposed to be hiding.</p><p>Amen? As you take a moment to do a brief review of those things that you know to be God's will, what is keeping you from being focused? How, as a question to you, how, by what means, in what incremental measure will you be seeking God's kingdom first in this next year?</p><p>First and foremost, if need be, yes, we will pray our hearts out so that God will help us put to the backseat all the things that is taking priority, my hobbies, my ambition, the stuff that I feel like I need today, I must have, my longing for this and that, all of that stuff needs to take a backseat.</p><p>But on the next, when we review and visit some of these things that you know, what is going to stir your heart? For me, as I took time to pray and meditate about this, I will say I have been so encouraged by our church this year. I really have.</p><p>As representative of our outreach team, I want to thank every single one of you guys. This year, whenever we planned an event, we felt like the church members were constantly bringing out their family members. You know, you guys have heard me talk much about our Bible study newcomers group.</p><p>Some of you guys have heard me say this, but we had over 100 people go through that class this year. And so many times, if I greet somebody and say, oh, how'd you happen to come by Berean? They'll say, well, my brother told me I should come. My sister told me I should come.</p><p>So many times when we had our boothing outside, someone would come. They'd say, oh, how'd you come to Berean? It's like, oh, my coworker kept on badgering me. I see the fruit of we were investing priority on healthy church. And when healthy church is moving, there is witness taking place.</p><p>And I have been so stirred because for me, the scriptures tell us in 2 Timothy chapter 4, verse 5, that for young Timothy, it says, but you be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. It has been so stirring to my heart to be able to walk from room to room and in between, have one of you guys stop me, introduce me to your relative, and have the sweet joy in sharing the burden of love to share the gospel with the people you love.</p><p>There's nothing more stirring to my heart. And I pray I can do the same, that whether it's my sons, I'm walking with them, and I'm talking to you, and you share your testimony with them. If I bring any relative, any friend from the past, that we will be joined in this purpose of sharing the kingdom of God.</p><p>Amen? And so even if it's not that for you, in thinking about the next year, the question is, one, what worries are distracting you? What worries have become your deciding criteria, trying to stem off all the things that could go wrong, trying to make sure you're pursuing the security?</p><p>Let's not move into the next year with the burden of anxiety on our heart. But rather, let's think about how can I, in just a single incremental measure, seek the kingdom of God? How can I, in one single incremental measure, seek the righteous character of my God, that I would bear his image and be unto this world a great light for his glory?</p><p>Amen? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for the challenge of the words of our Lord. Thank you for your mercy upon us. God, we feel your incredible loving mercy, where you would tend to the worries and anxieties of your disciples. Father God, I pray that you will strengthen our faith.</p><p>Lord, we confess we are people beset with fears and worries. But God, when we draw closer to the Lord, help all of those fears to subside and disappear. I pray, Father God, that we'll live with incredible confidence in the Lord. I pray, Father God, that we would have great ambition for your kingdom.</p><p>And I ask, God, that we will be a church characterized by incredible trust and prayer, but also incredible strength as a fruit of that prayer. We thank you, Lord, and ask for your spiritual blessing in this next year. It's in Christ's name. Amen. All right, at this time, I want to encourage all of you to just bundle up, either within your family groups, or just turn to your neighbor in groups of three to four and take some time to pray.</p><p>Because we only have about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock hits, please take time to briefly share just like a thing, OK? What are your biggest worries that has been kind of plaguing your mind, that may potentially wreak havoc on some of your focus next year? And then let's think about what incremental step I can take to seek God's kingdom more, OK?</p><p>So I'm going to give you guys about 10 minutes. We'll draw our attention back. We'll do the countdown together. And then at the end of it, we'll sing a closing song, OK? So please go ahead, take initiative, look to your neighbor, and take some time to pray.</p></div></body></html>
