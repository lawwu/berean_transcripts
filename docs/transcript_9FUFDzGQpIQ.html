Lord, I just pray that you would give us good studies tonight, help us to continue to worship you even as we continue through 1 Peter.</p><p>Lord, and just teach us to be holy as you are holy, God.

Let me be as gold and flesh is silver. Purify my heart. Let me be as gold, pure gold. Refine, oh, shine. My heart's one desire is to be holy. Set apart for you, Lord, I choose to be holy. Set apart for you, my master, ready to do your will.</p><p>Purify my heart. Cleanse me from within and make me holy. Purify my heart. Cleanse me from my sins. Deep within, we find respite. My heart's one desire is to be holy. Set apart for you, Lord, I choose to be holy. Set apart for you, my master, ready to do your will.</p><p>Refiner's fire. My heart's one desire is to be holy. Set apart for you, Lord, I choose to be holy. Set apart for you, my master, ready to do your will. Ready to do your will. Ready to do your will. All right, good evening, everybody. Can I get the next slide?</p><p>So, verse 13 we covered last week, but I figured in context, it would be good to just include that in our reading. So, let me read this for us and then go over the questions that I'd encourage you guys to discuss, and then we'll pray, and then we'll get our small group time ready to go.</p><p>All right, here's 1 Peter 1, 13 to 19. "Therefore, prepare your minds for action. Keep sober in spirit. Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance.</p><p>But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior. Because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.' If you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth, knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood as of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ." Next slide.</p><p>So, number one and two you guys are used to doing, just the questions and the observations, but the third one is something you might spend the bulk of your time on, and that's what does it mean for a Christian to conduct his life on earth in fear? And so does this mean a Christian needs to worry about losing his salvation by committing a sin, maybe so grievous that something happens?</p><p>Are we to fear like the judgment of the church, of man, of God? So that's going to come up, and so please do discuss that when you have some time. We're going to go until 820. Right now is 718, but let me pray and then we'll break up into our small group time.</p><p>Lord, we learned last week that the whole point of human history and the whole point of creation really was just your glory and our being reconciled to you for your glory. And today we're learning what it means to live in response to these gospel truths. Help us to study well, help us to share well, and that this will not just puff us up, that this will not just be an academic endeavor, but Lord, as we study together, that you would cause us to feel more burdened to pursue Christ more passionately, that you would cause us to be more thankful that this salvation is not based on our works, that we would be humbled, that you would call us to be like you.</p><p>So we pray for our small group leaders, that you would give them insight, that you would give them the ability to really lead and guide the discussion well. And I pray for all of us, especially for those who prepared a lot, that you would cause us to feel humble more than overexcited to share what we've gleaned.</p><p>So Lord, would you receive the honor at this time, help us to use this as a fellowship where you are at the center. So we thank you, Lord God, for this evening, and we pray for your help to study and glean much. In Jesus' name we pray. So we'll see you at 820.</p></div></body></html>
