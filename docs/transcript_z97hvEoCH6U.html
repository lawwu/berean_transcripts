If you could turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 11 today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Heavenly Father, would you help us, Lord, and maybe perhaps more than just trying or thinking through a lot of things I'm going to do or not do, just to simply allow your word to lay us bare today, that your spirit might bring to understanding and remembrance reality of what's going on in our own hearts, so that the walls that are rebellious against you would crumble and fall before your word, that your spirit of truth would be allowed in so that we might heed and obey. And Father, as a result, that we might change, and that we might see the glory of you, our God, that we would long for the things that we believe. And Father, that our hearts really would shatter, that your word would break it as hammer on stone, that our hearts would shatter, that you give us a heartbeat in these things. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Would you all rise for a concluding worship?  Christ the sure and steady anchor In the fury of the storm When the winds of doubt blow through me And my sails have all been torn In the suffering, in the sorrow When my sinking hopes are due I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed Christ the sure and steady anchor While the tempest rages on When temptation claims the battle And it seems the night has won Deeper still than goes the anchor Though I justly stand accused I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed It shall never be removed Christ the sure and steady anchor Through the floods of unbelief Hopeless somehow, O my soul now Lift your eyes to Calvary This my ballast of assurance See His love forever prove I will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed Christ the sure and steady anchor As we face the wave of death When these trials give way to glory As we draw our final breath We will cross that great horizon Clouds behind and life secure And the call will be the better For the storms that we endure Christ the sure of our salvation Ever faithful, ever true We will hold fast to the anchor It shall never be removed Amen. Thank you so much. That's very good. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God upon us and the fellowship of the people of the Holy Spirit upon us for unto the service of every man, in order that we may be sharper than the other, and for only to obtain our Christ-like identity. God sent His Son They called Him Jesus He came to love, heal, and forgive He lived and died to buy my pardon An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived Because He lives I can face tomorrow Because He lives all fear is gone Because I know He holds the future And life is worth the living just because He lives Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm safe on this solid ground The Lord is my salvation</p></div></body></html>
