href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=112s">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I am kind of reluctant to get out of it because, again, Romans is, you know, I have shared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=119s">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with you many times Romans is probably the book that if I had one book that I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=124s">00:02:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to put to memory and really have it regurgitating in my soul, it would be the Book of Romans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=128s">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because it is so rich in content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=130s">00:02:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Every aspect of the gospel that we hear of all our lives, whether you have been a Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=135s">00:02:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">for a year or you have been a Christian for 30, 40 years, basically what we are doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=140s">00:02:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">every single week is reexamining, deepening on our understanding of what Paul is saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=145s">00:02:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Book of Romans in different aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=149s">00:02:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul is going to conclude this letter in the same way that he started the Book of Romans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=154s">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, assuming that none of you remember what we talked about in Romans chapter 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=160s">00:02:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but I gave a brief overview last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=162s">00:02:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically the content of what he says here is repeated exactly the same thing that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=167s">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">says when he opens up the letter in Romans chapter 1, 1 through 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=171s">00:02:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It talks about God's power, the purpose of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=174s">00:02:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It talks about mystery that is to be revealed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=177s">00:02:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It talks about sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=179s">00:02:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we are talking about, he says it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=182s">00:03:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So he is kind of wrapping it up with these two book ends of this is the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=186s">00:03:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is basically what he has been expositing the last 16 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=189s">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The two things that we looked at last week was the gospel is a demonstration of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=193s">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=194s">00:03:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the power of God that people are constantly looking to connect with God with his power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=201s">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to see him doing miraculous things and if he heals or if he does something beyond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=206s">00:03:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">human ability, we say that is God's power and that would help me to see and believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=211s">00:03:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=212s">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But the scripture says it is the gospel, the gospel, his death and resurrection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=218s">00:03:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the demonstration of God's power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=220s">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second part that we talked about how Jesus is the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=225s">00:03:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That the preaching of the gospel is the preaching of Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=227s">00:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That Jesus says that he is I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=230s">00:03:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point of all that we have learned about the gospel is to bring us ultimately to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=235s">00:03:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just through him, but to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=239s">00:03:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You can come to church all your life and never have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=244s">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody can blaspheme his name and you get very offended when you say your mama is and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=248s">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then you get nervous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=249s">00:04:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you say God is, nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=252s">00:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there is no personal affection for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=256s">00:04:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You hear people blaspheming his name and it doesn't offend you because there is no personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=259s">00:04:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">connection with this Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=261s">00:04:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we are not careful, we can be an expert of the gospel, expert of what the word of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=266s">00:04:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">God says, but be completely emotionally in every practical aspect completely disconnected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=272s">00:04:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with this God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=274s">00:04:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second part was Jesus is the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=278s">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The third, fourth and fifth, the third is the main part and the fourth and fourth and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=282s">00:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fifth is going to be kind of tagging along with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=285s">00:04:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to be spending most of my time on the third point where the gospel is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=289s">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">mystery revealed.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/305876679#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to be careful when we study the Bible that we don't project onto it what we think</span></div><div
