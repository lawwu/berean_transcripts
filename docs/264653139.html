href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=143s">00:02:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you guys are able to come a little bit early and kind of study through the text together,</span></div><div

it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=153s">00:02:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">would benefit greatly for many of us.</span></div><div

Man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=169s">00:02:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Son of Man who we know to be the risen

down all these things that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=179s">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saying to you and then deliver this message to the seven churches."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=183s">00:03:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what we see in chapters 2 and 3, the seven churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=187s">00:03:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from chapters 4 through 7, we see a vision in heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=191s">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We see the great throne room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=193s">00:03:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We see everything worshiping God, everyone worshiping God there in that throne room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=198s">00:03:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then all eyes turn their attentions to this Jesus who is described as the slain lamb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=206s">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's given this scroll that all of heaven is hoping would be opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=212s">00:03:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And only Jesus, only the slain lamb is able to open up this scroll that is the title or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=220s">00:03:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the deed to the earth, that God might redeem the earth once it's opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=224s">00:03:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And with the opening of every seal, we saw God's wrath poured down upon the earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=231s">00:03:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Then when seal 7 was opened, we heard silence and then we see these trumpets begin to blow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=240s">00:04:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We went through the first six trumpets and then two weeks ago, we went into that interlude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=248s">00:04:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So today what we're going to be doing is going into this second part of the interlude into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=252s">00:04:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the seventh and final trumpets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=255s">00:04:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to give you a snapshot of the future as well, what we see, a lot of the action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=261s">00:04:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to center around three sets of seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=264s">00:04:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's the seven seals, seven trumpets, and then the seven bowls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=269s">00:04:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What you see in between are interludes and things happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=272s">00:04:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There are kind of breaks in the action to describe whether it be in the future or in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=277s">00:04:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the past, things that have happened or are going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=280s">00:04:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it continues the narrative of how it all unravels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=288s">00:04:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=289s">00:04:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look down at chapter 11, verse 1, we'll read from verse 1 through 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=295s">00:04:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff and I was told, 'Rise and measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=299s">00:04:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=302s">00:05:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But do not measure the court outside the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=305s">00:05:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample the holy city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=309s">00:05:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">for 42 months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=311s">00:05:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will grant authority to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1,260 days clothed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=318s">00:05:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in

thing called the measuring rod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=326s">00:05:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this is what's told to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=329s">00:05:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"Take this measuring rod and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=335s">00:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=336s">00:05:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So for those of you who are able to kind of take a look at this, the big question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=342s">00:05:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=343s">00:05:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this measuring rod and why are we doing it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=347s">00:05:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or why is he being called to measure the temple?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=350s">00:05:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at that first bullet point, a measuring rod was usually a hollow reed-like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=356s">00:05:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">plant light enough to be used to measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=358s">00:05:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you guys have ever had like one of those sticks that are hollow inside and it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=363s">00:06:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like a bamboo type thing, very light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=366s">00:06:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this was something used during this time, very ideal for measuring anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264653139#t=373s">00:06:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And many times buildings would need to be measured and
