Happy Lord's Day. We will now begin our service. >> All right, good morning. Welcome to Bryn Community Church. Let me give you a few announcements before we get started. First of all, as you guys know, Easter Resurrection Sunday is just around the corner. Next week is the Palm Sunday, and that's going to kick off the whole week of celebration and remembering.</p><p>And so starting from next Sunday and then starting from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we're going to have devotions following the life of Christ. And so we'll have each night, we're going to have one of the pastors kind of go through the passage, what Jesus did on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And then we're going to have testimonies that are going to be presented during that time.</p><p>And then on Thursday, we have Passover meal that Pastor Mark is going to be leading. And so if you haven't participated in that, again, it's very helpful to understand what Jesus was doing right before he went to the cross. And so if you haven't signed up for that, you can sign up for it.</p><p>And again, they'll give you instructions on what to do when you come. And then again, so the flyer here is for you to take with you. And again, we'll print as many as needed. So use this as an opportunity to invite people and maybe even just initiate the gospel sharing.</p><p>So make sure you take that with you. Today, there's a newcomer's welcome lunch that's happening at 1245 after the third service. So if you signed up for that, please go to the other side of the cafe where you're going to have lunch ready. So if you just want to find out about what's going on in church, meet some of the leaders, that lunch is for you.</p><p>So just head over there and they'll have lunch prepared. And then today, we have college study hall from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. So if you just want to bring snacks or drinks or something just to encourage the college students during their study time, you can, again, go and just drop it off in the cafe and then they'll be able to enjoy that while they study.</p><p>Women's flag football, if you are playing, again, next Saturday on the 23rd is happening. VBS volunteers, our VBS program is starting on Monday, July the 15th to the 19th. And so they are looking for volunteers. And if you come in, you probably saw a sign on the wall saying VBS volunteer.</p><p>Our brother, Tim Irving, is out there. And so just go up and sign your name and then they'll give you instructions and what you need and the prep time and all that stuff. Okay, so you can do that. But one other thing, as I mentioned last week, that we are having a special seminar.</p><p>Our guest speaker, Pastor James Lee from Cross Life, is going to be coming and giving two sessions on the subject of abortion, IVF, and birth control. So we want to try to encourage as many people to come out. We have babysitting offered on that day. So I want to encourage the families to be able to come.</p><p>And so, you know, whether it's 100 people or even if the whole church comes out, we want to prepare for that. Again, we want to give you a heads up. It's on May 4th from 9 to 12 p.m. And we're going to have light snacks in the morning, maybe possibly to fill you.</p><p>And we're going to have a short break in between the two sessions. And then we're going to end the day that way. But I want to strongly encourage you to come out because this issue, for whatever the reason, is starting to penetrate into the church. And we want to make sure that we are all thinking biblically.</p><p>This is an important issue that we want to make sure that we're all on the same page. And not only for your information, but for you to be able to defend biblically where we ought to be standing on this particular issue. So we want to try to encourage as many of you to come out.</p><p>And so, again, we do have babysitting provided. So because of that, we need you to sign up. And so the sign-ups are online. And if you go outside, you'll see a sign-up table for that as well. So for those of you who don't have Facebook or you don't like going online to sign up, you can just go directly over there and they'll sign you up today.</p><p>There's no cost to this, but we do need to know how many people are coming so that we can better prepare for the babysitting and various things that we're doing. I think that's it for all the announcements. I'm going to pray for us. And, again, as I mentioned, we're transitioning through subsplash.</p><p>We're going to accept Zell for a few more weeks, and then after that, we're going to be completely transitioned over to subsplash. So if you haven't done so, please do that as soon as you can. So let me pray for the offering, and afterwards, our brother John Yang is going to come up, give his testimony, and be baptized this morning.</p><p>All right? Let's pray. Father, we thank you so much for your blessing. We thank you for your patience with us. Lord, whatever it is that we have brought into this room, whatever entanglement and distraction or discouragement that we may have, I pray, Father God, that you would search us and know us, that we would lay all our burdens at your feet.</p><p>I pray that our worship that we give to you would be a genuine overflow of the tremendous grace that you've given, that our hearts may be filled with thankfulness, and our praising, our giving, all of it, Lord God, would be a true act of worship in spirit and in truth.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that our giving, as we give to you cheerfully, may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Let us all rise, and before we continue our time of praise, if we could spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us.</p><p>Let's pray. Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory, blameless with great joy. To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time, and now, and forever.</p><p>Amen.</p></div></body></html>
