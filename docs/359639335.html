href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=51s">00:00:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to share a little bit about, you know, Marion and myself, our personal story with our

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=98s">00:01:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible verses just to show the heart of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=103s">00:01:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I just listed, you know, six passages, and there isn't going to be a lot of exposition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=108s">00:01:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think it's very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=109s">00:01:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Deuteronomy 10, 18, it says, "He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=119s">00:01:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And this idea of fatherless, if you type that up, in the Old

weak,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=131s">00:02:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't have the, you know, the fatherless is one of the weakest, you know, parts of society</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=138s">00:02:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the sense that they are

<span class="t">So God's part of the fatherless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=151s">00:02:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And in Matthew 25, 40, right, in that passage, that's the final judgment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=157s">00:02:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and Jesus is giving this parable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=160s">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "And the king will answer

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=197s">00:03:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this idea of caring for the fatherless, this idea of looking after the orphans,</span></div><div

aware of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=1970s">00:32:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something recent, and we thought through the

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=1978s">00:32:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">First is, one, each applicant family will receive $3,000 in adoption

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=1996s">00:33:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of just budget, the church will help support once the adoption is finalized, and there's some practical reasons for doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2007s">00:33:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the qualification needs to

that they fill it out, turn it in to us, let us look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2018s">00:33:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2022s">00:33:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, an applicant must be a good standing member of

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2120s">00:35:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we'll have some open discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2123s">00:35:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I asked them to fill out some questions, and based on that, and because, you know, we don't have a lot of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2130s">00:35:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to direct certain questions to certain people to

everything seemed normal for us, and so we just felt like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2279s">00:37:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I just

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2347s">00:39:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we actually saw it in a film-ish event at our church, like maybe a few months later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2351s">00:39:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the second time I saw it, I really felt just more like, just hearing the pastor's testimony,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2358s">00:39:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I just really remember being like, oh, he was just a normal person too, like just a guy who got married</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2365s">00:39:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and had kids, but then his son ended up having a lot of medical conditions where he needed to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2370s">00:39:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the hospital a long time, and he ended up having a lot of needs for orphans needing adoption,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2377s">00:39:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then later he saw a gang of babies, but for me, I think the takeaway was like, oh, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2381s">00:39:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he was no different, or like he never had this grand vision when he was a reaper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2386s">00:39:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so for us too, I just felt like maybe God will give us what we need if we choose to go for an adoption,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2393s">00:39:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then both of us separately, without really talking about it, were open to adoption,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2398s">00:39:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so we were kind of meeting with our spouse and mother, like, okay, like we should really agree about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2402s">00:40:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">then since God kind of saw both of us today, adoption separately, and then I think the last part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2409s">00:40:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that I remember is, all of last year, we were praying about, you know, it's really take this year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2413s">00:40:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to really agree about adoption, and we went to Japan with our church, like in September-ish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2419s">00:40:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we decided at the beginning of that year, like, okay, after Japan, then we'll really seriously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2424s">00:40:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">think about applying, and then, but during that trip in Japan, we met two families there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2429s">00:40:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that had adopted

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2439s">00:40:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I think this is what we want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2443s">00:40:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it helped that when we saw you go through the process initially, and you got exposure to it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2450s">00:40:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so we weren't closing it for you. It was just like, oh, that would be a very option for us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2457s">00:40:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">very openly consider, and then I think for me, I was just kind of praying about, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2463s">00:41:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what is it that we want?

It's intertwined throughout all the Scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2610s">00:43:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and so that's always been a very big issue with her. Wherever we spoke of her, she has cousins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2618s">00:43:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that are adopted.

At the church there, the pastor had started doing a series on orphans, and from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2640s">00:44:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the people are a little less sophisticated there, where they just heard from the Scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2648s">00:44:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, true religion is this, they can take care of the orphans, and so they just go and do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2655s">00:44:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, hundreds of families just started fostering two dogs, and I have no bearing on biological children</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2664s">00:44:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or not, one of them had to be adopted, and already started adopting, so that's why three, four, five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2670s">00:44:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">adopted kids were there, and then suddenly another biological kid would show up somewhere in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=2676s">00:44:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it had no connection to biological or adoption.

And so it became kind of a campaign to go to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3050s">00:50:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Southern California churches and really, um, promote and advocate for Korean-American families to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3057s">00:50:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">something.

So, um, so actually, yeah, we ended up, um, ended up in the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3068s">00:51:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um, being connected with that particular agency that was in that article, and we went through our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3076s">00:51:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trial and process.

But, uh, we didn't have a clear idea of what type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3153s">00:52:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">adoption, whether it be international, domestic, or programming. But, uh, what we did have was somewhat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3160s">00:52:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of a timeline. We thought, we have four children that are very young. So, at one, I mean, and I'm the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3166s">00:52:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">primary caregiver at home. So, uh, we have, uh, once my youngest goes to elementary school, I'll have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3174s">00:52:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to catch my breath a little bit and, and drive the, the, the energy and the, the tension</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3180s">00:53:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of the child. But we had no idea to what extent this was going to work. But the idea of it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3186s">00:53:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">becoming more and more of a bio-child. And, um, and then at the same time, that idea of fostering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3193s">00:53:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of not fostering, foster adoption. So adopting out of the domestic, uh, county children that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3199s">00:53:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be aging out. That became something that I started just embracing. Looking into it, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3205s">00:53:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just working with organizations to support, learning about, like, you know, uh, just all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3211s">00:53:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and I started to really pray about foster adopting and looking into it and, and thought, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3218s">00:53:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">why go overseas when there's so much need here? And the more I looked into it, I just loved it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3224s">00:53:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I couldn't wait to do it. But I didn't know, um, when, uh, or, you know, what it's going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3233s">00:53:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I kind of knew I wanted to allow my, my biological children, or children to just kind of grow up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3239s">00:53:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where they're a little more self-sufficient. So that was our timeline. And then, um, and we had been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3247s">00:54:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um, we had our fourth child in 2015. And, uh, a couple years later, my husband had a procedure shot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3254s">00:54:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because we were like, we're done, done. And we're getting old. So we're done, done, done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3259s">00:54:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so we're like, okay, now we are going to strategically plan for that time when we're going to allow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3267s">00:54:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, surrender to this call. And then, um, fast forward, uh, November of last year, uh, we had the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3277s">00:54:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, our church put together an adoption summit, which is, I'm so blessed by that event because, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3284s">00:54:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so just to preface that is, uh, Korea has, um, our, yeah, Korea, amongst other countries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3292s">00:54:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have age-limited, as far as how old adopted parents can be. So last November, he, a week before my husband</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3300s">00:55:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">turned 49, um, was when the Orphan Sunday was. And we were, we walked right past Holt to go to Olive Crest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3312s">00:55:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and Bethany.

And then she's like, how old are you? And I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3343s">00:55:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, my husband's about to turn 49.

And, um, he said, wait, she said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3349s">00:55:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wait, are you guys both Korean? And, um, we said yes. And so she said, no, no, no, it's not too late,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3356s">00:55:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not too old.

To be honest, I looked into the whole Korean thing, and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3369s">00:56:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my heart personally was that there was not much of a need, that more people were wanting to adopt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3375s">00:56:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">than the demand or the supply was available, is, is what I came to the conclusion of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3381s">00:56:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">especially because about nine years ago, a lot of adoption laws had changed.

I said, why do that when we have all this money here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3392s">00:56:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, so when she kind of draws in, we're like, tell us more. And she just started telling us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3400s">00:56:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then she's like, how many kids do you have?

They're like, great, because that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3404s">00:56:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the maximum you can have. So we were like, by the skin of our teeth, we just kind of made it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3411s">00:56:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">She actually was disappointed.

We have 49 and a half.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3418s">00:56:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had a good six months to get our application, and the thought is you have to have a home setting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3423s">00:57:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">approved by 49 and a half. So basically, even though our timeline was such, um, after that interaction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3433s">00:57:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we went home, turned the TV off for the children, and we sat down, and I literally, like, had my head in my hat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3443s">00:57:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just, because conviction was so strong, and I didn't understand. I wasn't ready. I wanted my child to go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3456s">00:57:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I needed her to go. Not ready to turn in an application, but then we, we hope the Lord will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3464s">00:57:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hear what she says. She's like, if you register this month, you get $100. Just kidding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3470s">00:57:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">[laughter]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3474s">00:57:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, and then, so my husband and I talked, and without skipping a beat, we were all on the same page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3481s">00:58:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We're like, this is a clear call from the Lord. He's opening up a small window, and so let's do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3488s">00:58:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I was so scared, because I wasn't ready, and I, like, banged, and so we're like, okay, let's do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3497s">00:58:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see what it's going to be like. So the next working day, which is one day, we call the director,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3503s">00:58:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the bachelor director, and we told her our story. She said, great, let's get you started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3507s">00:58:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to make sure we're on the same page. And she's like, no problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3511s">00:58:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, actually, we thought we had, like, a year and a half, and she's like, we're actually at 29 and a half.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3515s">00:58:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, so good. You can't do it any quicker. Rush, rush, rush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3519s">00:58:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, okay. So this whole thing was just, like, out of the blue, and, but one thing clear was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3526s">00:58:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">our condition was solid. We were, like, we knew this was from the Lord. So we said, let's do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3532s">00:58:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">She was like, equip us with what we need. So, but all along, you know, I, my heart was towards foster care,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3541s">00:59:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and we, you know, our children were raised with the word adoption in mind. And so it was never a matter of if,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3548s">00:59:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it was when. So all our children, you know, we'd be driving, and you'd look at a homeless person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3554s">00:59:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're like, oh, can we adopt him? And they're like, no. Like, grown person, we can't adopt him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3560s">00:59:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'd just be like, oh my gosh, he looks like my brother. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3565s">00:59:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, so it was always a matter of when. And so the first person I wanted, the first child I wanted to talk to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3571s">00:59:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was our oldest, who was eight. And so I sat down, and I showed her the brochure of the whole family bond,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3577s">00:59:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I said, hey, remember what we talked about, like, possibly adopting, like, a person that doesn't look like us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3584s">00:59:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, which, we always kind of imagined a black child, you know, a little less adoptable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3589s">00:59:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, and he said, yeah. And I said, how, what do you think about us going to Korea and adopting, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3595s">00:59:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">someone with something that looks like us? And then, and then he said, he looked down at the brochure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3601s">01:00:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which had two Asian boys. And he said, all right, we can get him. We can get him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3608s">01:00:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, we can get the sweetie, you know. And then, so, and then, so that's that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3613s">01:00:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just started the process of mountain work, of paperwork, and just, they want to know everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3619s">01:00:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and just, you know, with Madison's schedule, and the four children, it just, since then we've been doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3624s">01:00:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Many times, you know, we realize that this is what people go through. There's so, so much paperwork.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3634s">01:00:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to pay all along the way. And financially, we weren't, you know, we weren't, we trusted with sort of our finances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3643s">01:00:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so we never really prepared financially, $50,000 spent on the side, you know, because we kind of just thought it was going to be domestic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3650s">01:00:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all of it was kind of a surprise to us. And so, we've been at it, and we are currently at, we submitted our home study paperwork,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3661s">01:01:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're just waiting for the final approval. And, but, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3669s">01:01:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is he, are you still under the timeline?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3672s">01:01:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they seem to not be worried, so we're okay. I keep my insurance, because if he's 50 soon, and then, so, so I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3683s">01:01:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then another thing was just, you know, so far it's been under, I like to mention, a couple of weeks ago, we were surprised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3696s">01:01:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were done, done, done with biological children, and holy school, we were really surprised with the pregnancy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3705s">01:01:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, we found out we were pregnant at his turn 45, and at 46 seconds, we're in the thick of this adoption,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3716s">01:01:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and her cause equals his cause, and a pregnancy equals a drug overdose. And I was devastated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3724s">01:02:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">My first aunt, I was going to adopt, we were going to pay for our adopted child, we were really excited about it, and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3732s">01:02:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that was pretty bad, you know. And so, so this is very recent, and so a lot of pain, and searching scripture, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3744s">01:02:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">seeking God's comfort through this, and trusting him, and so long story short, we, you know, chose to shun our adoption,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3760s">01:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, embrace this pregnancy, life that it's given us, and so we started getting excited about this child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3771s">01:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't even tell our family, we didn't tell our children, we didn't even know how to break it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3776s">01:02:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a few days later, I started, you know, having, having, and then eventually I miscarried, and that was actually very recent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3787s">01:03:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's been a rollercoaster of a life, but through this, all of it, what I'm so grateful for is that it reminded me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3799s">01:03:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as someone who kind of adopted his dream to adopt, and it became my dream, and I think in my flesh, I continue to try to make this out of my timeline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3811s">01:03:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and once it kind of looks good, I'm like, I try to take control, and the Lord continues to teach me to surrender,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3817s">01:03:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it be my adoption, or my pregnancy, or my timeline, or finances, he just keeps teaching me this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3825s">01:03:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, just all these verses came to my mind when this was happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3831s">01:03:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was still trying to get the kids ready, out, a few years, when I started, and I talked to her, and I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3837s">01:03:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">"I think I'm miscarrying right now, and I can't get them out of the house, and I'm just, you know, praying, and asking God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3845s">01:04:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And my initial thing is, "If you're going to give me this child, why don't you just give the kid a child?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3851s">01:04:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And very quickly, you know, I was humbled with the fact that she is God, she is God, and that he doesn't have to explain to me why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3866s">01:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that she just wants me to surrender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3869s">01:04:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But through it all, I think just, excuse me, but through it all, I felt so intimately close to the Lord,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3881s">01:04:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because, you know, we were seeking comfort, you know, through prayer, and through scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3888s">01:04:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I just felt so intimately close to the Lord, because I felt the wanting to draw me closer to Jesus Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3895s">01:04:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the surrendering he wanted to draw me closer, and that's all I kept feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3900s">01:05:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so rather than being angry, I just said, "I just think you are God, and you want me to go closer to your image,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3910s">01:05:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you want me to understand what true love is."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3915s">01:05:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it, you know, it forced me to examine my own part of this God's will, my intentions are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3921s">01:05:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we are back on track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3925s">01:05:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're still grieving a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3929s">01:05:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually only been like a week or so since he was carried, so we're, you know, kind of grieving the loss of a child,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3940s">01:05:40.960</a></span> | <span

teaching us that we're not trying to rescue a child, but he's teaching us whether to call for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3955s">01:05:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I have one question to add.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=3993s">01:06:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but she challenged me, she said, "You know, who doesn't

praying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4550s">01:15:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I pray for, to me, the unknown name, but I

<span class="t">But the kids, as they get older and they have problems and things, that's a very hard to find hope of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

are no homes for the kids to go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4587s">01:16:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's also another aspect to this, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4592s">01:16:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, you know, there's just different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4596s">01:16:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one of them that I think about a lot and pray about a lot is a lot of the kids that are in the foster care system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4603s">01:16:43.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4609s">01:16:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, I feel like, you know, the Bible's very clear, you know, on how God views that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4620s">01:17:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I really wrestle with that and weigh that and still, you know, and still that's a big burden on me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4628s">01:17:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because whoever comes into our home, I want to love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4633s">01:17:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not like, you know, our biological kids are 20, almost 18 and 12, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4639s">01:17:19.960</a></span> | <span

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4652s">01:17:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like from that standpoint, you know, it's like, I feel like God would provide wisdom day by day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4658s">01:17:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not an ideal

plan and likes to control and has had to surrender, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4672s">01:17:52.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4678s">01:17:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just think about like every day, like the challenges that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4685s">01:18:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's, you know, it's just really lifting that up to the Lord and realizing that, yeah, in many ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4691s">01:18:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that we're going to be unprepared in that as much as we try to prepare and get training and pray and whatnot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4698s">01:18:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that there are so many things because every chapter of life, you know, whether it was getting married or having, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4703s">01:18:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">biological kids or whatnot, you know, moving, it's like there's so many things that came out that were

knowing that there is going to be a lot of stuff like that that I can't, you know, foresee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4965s">01:22:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And realizing that our finances can't be spent building up my kingdom here, but it has to be something more worthwhile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=4980s">01:23:00.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5031s">01:23:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Someone sent a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5032s">01:23:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they're very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5033s">01:23:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be good to answer them so we could all be educated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5038s">01:23:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll wrap up with actually praying for our brothers and sisters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5042s">01:24:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I'd like for us to pray for them and also pray that our church will have this culture part for foster care and adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5055s">01:24:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually the next question is, someone asked what are some considerations for domestic versus international adoption?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5062s">01:24:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I asked if Jason and Jen, how you went through the process between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5068s">01:24:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for us, to be honest, we didn't necessarily do a ton of research before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5077s">01:24:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we had a general idea about whether it was foster care, adopt, or if it was straight, infant, domestic adoption, or international adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5088s">01:24:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think our idea was kind of, we just kind of felt we needed to adopt a pre-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5097s">01:24:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if those drop-offs are being associated with the other partners at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5102s">01:25:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Just looking at the criteria, we were thinking it was possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5106s">01:25:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was kind of our thought process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5110s">01:25:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think some things that we thought about was, it would be super comfortable with most domestic adoptions are relatively more open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5122s">01:25:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Which we weren't necessarily really close to, but those are things we obviously consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5129s">01:25:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we were open to not necessarily adopting an infant, so we were okay with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5139s">01:25:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So Maria, you know, a lot of you choose age or gender and have to be open to certain much moderate medical conditions in general to apply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5150s">01:25:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that was a lot of things we were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5156s">01:25:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think later on, we started learning a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5160s">01:26:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we realized there are really good options for domestic adoption too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5165s">01:26:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We definitely want to be more educated in and be careful of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5170s">01:26:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think fostering should always be a more practical thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5175s">01:26:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We were thinking about it initially, but then realizing a lot of people do domestic adoption for a pregnant mom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5185s">01:26:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which means a baby for their child on the floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5189s">01:26:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that pregnant moms and people do more by putting on them to the cost for awareness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5200s">01:26:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be similar for international adoption, but domestic adoption as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5205s">01:26:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was kind of something we learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5210s">01:26:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think with domestic, there's an aspect to it where you can see that people can change their mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5218s">01:26:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">versus international where it's kind of set along the back line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5222s">01:27:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thinking about certain aspects of that overall, just kind of came down to what we were comfortable with too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5230s">01:27:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I know it was a positive teach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5234s">01:27:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of it, like what I mentioned earlier too, we were more exposed to and heard a lot about the cult already from the get-go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5243s">01:27:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from just as a family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5245s">01:27:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We heard a lot about how well they could fix the process and take the procedures involved in fostering parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5255s">01:27:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even going through and competing with the doctors and doctors and evaluated physical, mental, and social.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5267s">01:27:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's a lot of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5269s">01:27:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It just kind of reassured me too that we were comfortable with the service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5275s">01:27:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think overall, I think I have a strong bias for one necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5281s">01:28:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just, it just came down to what we were comfortable with at the time we made the decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5287s">01:28:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what we're trying to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5289s">01:28:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question about what are some considerations for deciding between fostering versus adopting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5297s">01:28:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of the response to that, what were some of the thought processes that you guys have been through?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5305s">01:28:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we're just on the very last stage of the process of fostering parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5314s">01:28:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's not that we wouldn't be open to fostering adoptions at that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5319s">01:28:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the initial, but for now we are just being certified to be fostering parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5326s">01:28:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in terms of whether you're choosing to go the route of adopting or go the route of fostering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5337s">01:28:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the initial sort of conviction comes from the same place where you saw a lot of the verses that Paul and Hillary both shared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5345s">01:29:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, those were things that prompted our hearts and convicted us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5350s">01:29:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we just thought, I mean, I try to live a golden code as a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5358s">01:29:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Our children have us, and they have family, and something would happen to us, but if they didn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5364s">01:29:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't we want someone who is a person of faith to take them in so that they would be brought up in that kind of environment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5373s">01:29:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's why we kind of, you know, one of the motivations of why we wanted to foster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5381s">01:29:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as like going fostering versus adopting, just as we were learning about the need and just how things work in the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5394s">01:29:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it seemed like, as we were talking to our social worker and going through various steps, that there is a very large need of children that are in the system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5405s">01:30:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that have not had their rights relinquished by their parents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5412s">01:30:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they are in need of a home, but they're not necessarily in need of adoption at this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5420s">01:30:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we thought, and I shared about how, okay, what if we bring someone into our house and they stay with us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5426s">01:30:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, because it's indefinite in their fostering. It might be a few weeks, it might be years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5430s">01:30:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we think about how, you know, of course you're going to want to love as much as you can until you grow to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5437s">01:30:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like how can you say goodbye to someone if you have that kind of attachment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5442s">01:30:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I thought about how, you know, even our own children, they're not really ours, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5451s">01:30:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't possess them. God has given them to us as a gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5456s">01:30:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, at some point they will, you know, they will leave the home and hope that, you know, they will have a saving faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5464s">01:31:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and that they will live in a way that's a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5467s">01:31:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing that people hope for, the best outcome that people hope for, even from a humanistic standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5474s">01:31:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the children, you take care of them while their biological mother or father or, you know, families</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5482s">01:31:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">resolve whatever issue they're going through, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5485s">01:31:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether it is, you know, a homeless or whether they have drug addiction or whether they're in prison or whatever it is that they're going through,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5494s">01:31:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can get beyond that, that they can be healed of what it is that they're going through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5501s">01:31:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the child can be restored back to that family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5505s">01:31:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There can be that, right, that healing and there can be that reconciliation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5509s">01:31:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, again, for just a humanistic example, that's what the agency is hoping for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5514s">01:31:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But as Christians, you know, our prayer really is that, yeah, that that can happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5520s">01:32:00.960</a></span> |

href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5906s">01:38:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through the process right now, and also pray that God would give our church this culture of adopting and foster

yourselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/359639335#t=5940s">01:39:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and we will pray for where they are right now in
