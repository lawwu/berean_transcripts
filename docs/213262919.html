started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=338s">00:05:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time, Pastor Peter had not even joined the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1354s">00:22:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second person I thought is like, Pastor Mark probably knows because I spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1359s">00:22:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the most time with him outside of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1361s">00:22:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third person that I think of is Pastor Aaron probably knows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1365s">00:22:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my immediate thought was, that's the most logical person he probably asked because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1369s">00:22:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he knows him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1371s">00:22:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, Pastor Aaron and I spent so much time together while he was here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1375s">00:22:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that I miss about him being up there that we're not able to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1378s">00:22:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of time, but he's a brother that I love and God is using powerfully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1386s">00:23:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, many guys know he's a gifted

him, he genuinely loves the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1400s">00:23:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the thing I

to introduce a little video from his church before he begins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213262919#t=1416s">00:23:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So
