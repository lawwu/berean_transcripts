class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=179s">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Prior to Shaq leaving the Lakers, they won three championships, 2000, 2001, 2003.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=185s">00:03:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had a three-peat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=187s">00:03:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Shaq clearly was the most dominant player in all of the league.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=194s">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Kobe was an up-and-coming star and Shaq was the one who was dominant.</span></div><div

guys may not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=204s">00:03:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">remember this, those of you guys who are a little bit

again, and I wasn't a huge Lakers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=220s">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fan at that time because once Magic stopped playing, I just kind of lost interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=224s">00:03:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Kobe was just too cocky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=227s">00:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And Shaq came from another team, so it was hard for me to get attached.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=231s">00:03:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was hard to watch Shaq because Shaq's such a big guy and the opposing team would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=238s">00:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">run by him and use him as a pick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=241s">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Shaq would not go out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=243s">00:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So he actually became a liability on the team, so clearly Shaq was not playing like he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=248s">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to win a

though he won three championships, he was an up-and-coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=259s">00:04:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">star,

some of you guys may remember, may not remember, that had a lot to do with the Rift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=279s">00:04:39.120</a></span>

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=293s">00:04:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that had to do with him proving himself, that it wasn't just Shaq, that he was a superstar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/391853490#t=298s">00:04:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">independent of Shaq.</span></div><div class="c"><span
