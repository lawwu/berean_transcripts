href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, suffering causes the squeezing of our life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=162s">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it exposes, or identifies, whether the genuine faith causes us to run to God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=168s">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or it causes us to run to other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And thirdly, we talked about how glory that comes as a result of suffering</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=182s">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that this is the Christian perspective of what it means to suffer in this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=187s">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, in verse 23 to 25, he's going to be talking specifically in the context of this "here and not yet."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The experience of groaning and suffering in the life of a Christian, and why that may happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

initiated because the Holy Spirit that has been given to us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=838s">00:13:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was a

the first fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=855s">00:14:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not the totality of the harvest, but He

href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=882s">00:14:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We give the first of our first harvest and it signified that with this tithe all the rest belongs to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=889s">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was our act of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=890s">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the meaning of first harvest meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=893s">00:14:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The tithing meant in the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=895s">00:14:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the scripture says not only is the Holy Spirit the initiation of the salvation, the beginning of the salvation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=904s">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He says it is a deposit guaranteeing the

when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=918s">00:15:18.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=925s">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you guys who use the NIV, the word for guarantee is deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=930s">00:15:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the meaning behind this word in Greek, I think deposit is a more closer translation, at least what I've read, the meaning of this word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=940s">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether it's guarantee or deposit, basically what it means is that God put His stamp declaring that we are His.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=947s">00:15:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He initiated this and we have the stamp of our belonging to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=957s">00:15:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=958s">00:15:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a time, probably not in your lifetime, but at least not most of us, there was a time when even credit cards were not being used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=966s">00:16:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very scarce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=968s">00:16:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember when I was younger and I didn't have enough money, if I wanted to buy a pair of pants that I thought was going to look good on me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=974s">00:16:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I didn't have the money, we would go to the store and what's called a layaway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=979s">00:16:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody remember what a layaway?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=981s">00:16:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, okay, a few of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=982s">00:16:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=983s">00:16:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You would go and lay it away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=984s">00:16:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, you know, you have this pants that you like or a shirt that you like or the shoes that you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=990s">00:16:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You would put a deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=992s">00:16:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so deposit basically meant that they would tag that pants, put it away in the back, put your name on it and say it was worth $30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=999s">00:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's $5 deposit on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1001s">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So after I put the deposit, that pants can't be sold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1005s">00:16:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That belongs to me because I put that deposit on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1008s">00:16:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're waiting for me to come pay the rest of it so that I can pick that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1012s">00:16:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what they called layaway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1013s">00:16:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how we used to get stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1015s">00:16:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1016s">00:16:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it would take years, but it would take, that's how we would get stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1019s">00:16:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we would lay it away and get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1022s">00:17:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we used the term deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1023s">00:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think today's equivalent would be if you're purchasing a house, in order for that house to be taken off the market, you have to put a deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1030s">00:17:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that deposit holds that house so that it can't be sold until the contract period is done and you pay the final bill and then it becomes yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1039s">00:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, the significance of that deposit is that it is not completely yours yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1046s">00:17:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not there yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1048s">00:17:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is guaranteed that it will be yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1051s">00:17:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the Holy Spirit is given to us not only as the first fruit, initiation, but as a deposit, as a seal, guaranteeing that we belong to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1065s">00:17:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now why is this so significant?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1067s">00:17:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where the theology of here and not yet come from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1071s">00:17:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the promise of deliverance is not completely in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1078s">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not physical life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1080s">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The promise of deliverance, the promise of comfort, the ultimate promise of glorification is not in this life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1091s">00:18:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, the Holy Spirit has been given to us to initiate this salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1095s">00:18:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As a deposit guaranteeing our

we have an understanding of salvation being complete in this world, and when you don't experience completeness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1109s">00:18:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when you don't experience sanctification the way you think it ought to be, when you read the promises of God and it doesn't unfold the way you see it in other people's lives maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1119s">00:18:39.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1124s">00:18:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe God doesn't fulfill His promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1128s">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Either God is wrong or I am wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1132s">00:18:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, but when He says the Holy Spirit, well if He's given me the Holy Spirit, how come I'm not experiencing this, you know, like walking on water and healing people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1140s">00:19:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why am

href="https://www.vimeo.com/195357434#t=1157s">00:19:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That this initiation, this first fruit of the Holy Spirit causes us to groan inwardly.</span></div><div
