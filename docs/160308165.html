Okay, verse 14, short passage here where it says, "When the hour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=124s">00:02:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">had come he reclined at the table and the Apostles with him and he said to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=128s">00:02:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">them, 'I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=134s">00:02:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for I say to you I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=141s">00:02:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of God.'" Now what's very interesting about this passage is in this time of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=146s">00:02:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">preparation Jesus reveals his heart.

And what's more this term epithumia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is often used in other passages. Apostle Paul uses it synonymous with lust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=181s">00:03:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something that you're craving, something that you're like you cannot let go of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=185s">00:03:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">almost.

Why would Jesus Christ want to have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=192s">00:03:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Passover with them prior to the suffering?

Why does he so desire to have this meal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/160308165#t=205s">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">them prior to doing all that?
