Don't just be amazed at the supernatural. Any person could be amazed at the supernatural, what they see, hear. >> That being said, we're talking about the new birth, and it's something that I've been thinking about a lot, especially doing youth ministry, and maybe you too have been thinking about what new birth is and what new birth looks like. But before we begin our time of going into God's word, let me pray for us. I'm so excited to bless our time.</p></div></body></html>
