<span class="t">thriving in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=93s">00:01:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing, we studied in chapters 1 and into chapter 2, that there was a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=98s">00:01:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">calling

spread out to in the diaspora, so to speak, and he says, "But you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=116s">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span

salvation that they've been given, it wasn't a spur of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=121s">00:02:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">moment, but it was planned long ago, and even angels and prophets would look intently into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=127s">00:02:07.720</a></span> |

the expectation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=133s">00:02:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was a great calling and salvation and a

who they are to be in their character,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=141s">00:02:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in their love, in their hunger for the Word, and et cetera, et cetera, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=146s">00:02:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, then after giving that kind of preface, he says, "God is doing a great work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=153s">00:02:33.340</a></span> | <span

"You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=191s">00:03:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be who you are, who God has made you to be," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=195s">00:03:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a perspective that we have to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=198s">00:03:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more, he went on to a lengthy section where he started to describe different categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=203s">00:03:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=204s">00:03:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is number three, starting from chapter two, verse 13, he describes to them what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=210s">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">real strength found in submission, found in submission, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=216s">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's your word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=218s">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, "So every single one of you submit to governing authorities, whether governors,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=224s">00:03:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he talks about the workers or even slaves, and he says, "Even to those masters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=229s">00:03:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who seem unfair, unjust, submit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=233s">00:03:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says, "To the wives, even if your husband is disobedient to the word, learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=237s">00:03:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to submit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=238s">00:03:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he gives the example of Christ saying, "Look what Christ has done, voluntarily surrendering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=246s">00:04:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is real strength."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=248s">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly, starting from the end of chapter three into chapter four at the tail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=252s">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">end of it, he basically says, "Glorify God since the end is near."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=257s">00:04:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He puts it in other terms by saying, like, "Just don't suffer for being silly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=261s">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't suffer for your own

Peter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=276s">00:04:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">has been doing, as I summarize the whole book for us right now, is he's been giving us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=281s">00:04:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a perspective of

from Apostle Peter, but he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=290s">00:04:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "No, I'm going to challenge you to go above and beyond what you thought was natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=295s">00:04:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to you by

<span class="t">And what's more, God has given us an immense purpose, even through what's really confusing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=308s">00:05:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which is our persecution and our suffering, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/212296495#t=314s">00:05:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of that then empowers the Christians to go through these sufferings with a different</span></div><div
