href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=88s">00:01:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just coming to bring us to heaven, but ultimately it's a marriage ceremony.</span></div><div class="c"><span

to the wedding ceremony, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=108s">00:01:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially the last week and the

the great day, you know the chaos, but at the same time, the payoff on the wedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=119s">00:01:59.060</a></span> |

been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=122s">00:02:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The craziness starts and then it increases and then it gets utterly chaotic, and we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=127s">00:02:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">seen that in chapter 16, 17, and 18, and then chapter 19, we're kind of almost there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=132s">00:02:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not quite there yet, but we're almost there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=134s">00:02:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter 20, God takes us into the millennium, and then eventually 20, 21, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=140s">00:02:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">22 is going to describe the eternal state, which was all what everything that Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=146s">00:02:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">has done was leading to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=148s">00:02:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So today, Revelation chapter 19 is going to be divided into two parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=153s">00:02:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The first part is the praise, the three hallelujahs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=158s">00:02:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The kingdom of heaven is breaking out into praise, and then the second part is the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=162s">00:02:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">separate visions at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=164s">00:02:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's how it's going to be organized tonight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=170s">00:02:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">First part of it, if you remember, again, connecting this to chapter 18, chapter 18</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=177s">00:02:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">was the downfall of Babylon and the judgment, the intense judgment that came upon the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=182s">00:03:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and through the destruction of Babylon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=185s">00:03:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of chapter 18, if you remember, the Antichrist, thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=192s">00:03:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the Antichrist and the prophet and the kings, sorry, sorry, the Babylon is thrown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=201s">00:03:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">into utter destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=204s">00:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so chapter 19 is in response to God's judgment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=209s">00:03:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so God's judgment causes people to break out into worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=214s">00:03:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So worship is a response in Revelation of God, not just Revelation of God's mercy and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=219s">00:03:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">grace, God's justice is also reason for worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=221s">00:03:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole chapter 19 or a big chunk of chapter 19 basically is a response to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">revelation of the wrath of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=228s">00:03:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, we typically think that when we break out into praise or worship, we're always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=232s">00:03:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">praising God about his goodness and about his mercy and his righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=237s">00:03:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at the Psalms, a lot of the Psalms is very similar to chapter 19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=243s">00:04:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the Psalms is praising God for his wrath against the enemies, for his justice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=248s">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and also for righteousness, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=251s">00:04:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever God himself is revealed, so again, the thing that we need to be cautious about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=257s">00:04:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is again, when we just kind of pigeonhole and think like the only time that we worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is when God is being merciful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=267s">00:04:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not how the Bible describes worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=269s">00:04:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Worship is any time God's glory is manifested, whether it is in wrath or it is in mercy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=275s">00:04:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we see that in chapter 19, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=278s">00:04:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">His wrath is what initiates this intense worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=285s">00:04:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first hallelujah we see in verse one and two, it says, "After this, I heard what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=291s">00:04:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">seemed to be the loud voice of the great multitude in heaven crying out, 'Hallelujah, salvation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=297s">00:04:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and glory and power belongs to our God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=299s">00:04:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For his judgments are true and just, for he has judged a great prostitute who corrupted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=303s">00:05:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the earth with her immorality and has avenged on her blood of his servants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=308s">00:05:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Once more, they cried out, 'Hallelujah.'"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=309s">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So verses one and two is the first hallelujah we see, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=313s">00:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Hallelujah literally means praise Yahweh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=318s">00:05:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably have been singing that all, maybe if you grew up in the church all your life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=323s">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's the literal meaning behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=325s">00:05:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's two words, alel and Yahweh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=328s">00:05:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So hallelujah means praise Yahweh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=333s">00:05:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first step of the end times is judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=337s">00:05:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Christ comes, the scripture says the very first thing he's going to do, he's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=341s">00:05:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to judge the righteous and the unrighteous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=344s">00:05:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we see, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

just dragging yourself in, tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2595s">00:43:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">me that doesn't affect your

worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2607s">00:43:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So your private prayer life, fellowship, building, evangelism, all of that, the foundation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2613s">00:43:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that is

that's the first question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2627s">00:43:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, in what way has Jesus proven

| <span class="t">Thirdly, some argue, and this is a question I brought up before, some argue that literal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2648s">00:44:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hell is unfair when compared to the brevity of our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2652s">00:44:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the typical argument, this is, you know, like sometimes Christians, even Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2656s">00:44:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">will argue, you know, our sins are committed during a limited period of our life, 70 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2663s">00:44:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">80 years, no matter how long we live, but punishment is

href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2670s">00:44:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of debate happens because of that question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/241447694#t=2675s">00:44:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But clearly, don't twist what the Word of God says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
