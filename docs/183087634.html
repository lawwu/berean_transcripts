In Christ Jesus our Lord." Let's pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=39s">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint this time, that your word would go forth, that our hearts may be sober, and as you are the potter, help us to be moldable clay, that we may not simply be hearers, but to be doers. We thank you, in Jesus' name we pray, Amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=62s">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you guys know, Paul has been arguing the Gospel up to this point, and why we are in desperate need of Jesus. Whether you are a moral person or an immoral person, no one is righteous by their own effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=77s">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the point that he was getting, that salvation is by grace, and by grace alone. It is not the righteous that he chooses, it's the sinners that he justifies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=86s">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the question that he's been dealing with in chapter 6 is, well doesn't that lead to licentiousness? Doesn't that lead to lawlessness? Isn't that going to create an environment where people say, well let's sin, that grace may abound?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=98s">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Superficially, yes. When there is a superficial conversion, superficial understanding, a conversion experience where all it was was just raising of hand, or just simple acknowledgement of truth, that's exactly what it creates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=114s">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It creates a generation of people who are absolutely certain over their salvation without genuine conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=122s">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what Paul is arguing in chapter 6 is about genuine conversion, genuine salvation. What happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=130s">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, our issue in our generation, in a post-Christian culture, is that we don't measure our righteousness, or we don't measure our salvation or faith based upon what we see in scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=143s">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Often times we measure it by the culture or the people that are around us. So, if our Christianity looks like the Christianity that we are a part of, we feel safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's what it looks like. And so, there are times when we're sharing the gospel and we ask them, do you want to accept Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just a lot of times so flippant. I've been out on campus and out on the street sharing the gospel, and so many times, after I would do the presentation, I'd say, would you like to accept?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could tell by their eyes, it's like, sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=173s">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, by their response, well, they said yes, but I don't see any conviction of, you know, but I don't want to judge them. They said yes, so let's do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we'd go through the sinner's prayer, and then they would pray, and then after it was done, they're like, alright, thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=189s">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, hey, you know, I want to introduce you to a church, can I have your phone number? It's like, ah, no thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=194s">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I always kind of left thinking, was that a real conversion? Did they really accept that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=199s">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, well, it sounded almost kind of like, oh, if salvation is free, I'll take it, just in case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=206s">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just in case what you're saying is real. Yeah, I don't want to go to hell. What's that going to cost me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's free. You said it was free, right? And if I do this prayer, I'm going to go to heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=217s">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what you're saying? It's like, hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=221s">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I stopped doing that for that reason. I stopped doing that years ago, because I didn't leave that situation thinking that there was real conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, again, you and I live in a generation where thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people accepted Christ, gave Jesus a chance. Why not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it created this environment that people who are complaining or concerned about what they're asking here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=251s">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Shall we sin that grace may abound? Isn't this going to lead to licentiousness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Church filled with people who are not pursuing righteousness, but have absolute conviction that when they die, they're going to go to heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what the scripture says?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a clear distinction between before Christ and after Christ. I mean, that's the way that we talk about history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=275s">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. I mean, we don't I don't think the history books use it that way anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we had B.C. and A.D. before Christ and A.D. Anno Domini, the year of the Lord, which basically we mean after Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a clear distinction in our Christian lives as before and after we met Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=294s">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes we talk about conversion as like, oh, I didn't go to church. I started going to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't a member. I became a member. You know, I wasn't really thinking much about God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=304s">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I started thinking much about God. There are some things that I was doing wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=307s">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And and so I decided not to do that and to and to take my faith a little bit more seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=313s">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying any of that stuff is wrong, but the way the Bible describes conversion is slaves to sin and slaves to righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible describes conversion as being children of the devil versus children of God, of eternal damnation versus eternal life as adopted children of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian isn't simply I didn't go to church or I didn't take it seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=343s">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I just kind of are more serious now than I was last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a an absolute line that is crossed when regeneration happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=355s">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not unique to our generation. This happens in any culture where Christianity becomes a post-Christian culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=363s">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is remnants of Christianity, church attendance, Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=368s">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have in God we trust printed in our money. I mean, if there's any culture that's post-Christian culture, it is the culture that you and I live in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=375s">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the danger of living in a post-Christian culture is we feel safe being saturated by Christian things without genuine conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=387s">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was a German theologian who lived during the period of the Nazis, also lived in a very nominal Christian culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=396s">00:06:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Reformation had a huge impact hundreds and hundreds of years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=400s">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But by the time the Nazis began to rise in power, it was a very nominal Christian culture. It was a post-Christian culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=408s">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of Christian things, a lot of old Christian relics, churches that at one point fought for the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=415s">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it was a very liberal place. And Bonhoeffer writes a book, and some of you guys are very familiar with, called Discipleship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=424s">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Bonhoeffer writes about this cheap grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=428s">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Cheap grace amounts to the justification of sin without justification of the repentant sinner who departs from sin and from whom sin departs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=437s">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cheap grace is not the kind of forgiveness of sin which frees us from the toils of sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=442s">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cheap grace is a grace without discipleship, grace without cross, grace without Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=449s">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, cheap grace isn't grace at all.

Justification, sanctification, and glorification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183087634#t=460s">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">None of these

it in three different parts because the Bible describes our salvation as past, present, and future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
