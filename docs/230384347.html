love for Israel, I'm going to share that at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230384347#t=160s">00:02:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the very end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230384347#t=161s">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though you might be sitting, I'm already addressing

with me to get to the conclusion and the application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230384347#t=175s">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of
