especially in the United States, but all over the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=104s">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a remembrance of what happened in 9/11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=107s">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you guys probably saw that online or at work or wherever it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=112s">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's the 19th anniversary of what took place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=115s">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you guys who've been to New York may have seen the monuments, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=118s">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the thing that you see all over is that we will never forget, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=123s">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the reason why, when there's these specific things that happen in history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=129s">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where whether it is by creating a holiday or monuments or just taking time to remember these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=136s">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is because by remembering, there are certain things that we want to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=141s">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it is that we're thinking or doing now, that we wouldn't forget about it going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously when we think about 9/11, one of the first things that we think about are the people who lost their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=153s">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, over 3,000 people were killed that day, and out of the 3,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">343 of them were firefighters who ran into the building to save lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=163s">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and 71 of them were NYPD law enforcement who went in to basically help the people come down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result of their sacrifice, obviously, you know, they ended up losing their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so part of the reason why we remember is to remember the people who gave their lives in the context of saving lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's interesting now that even though that was 19 years ago, just even probably a few months ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=189s">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we were praising people, you know, especially the first responders, the police officers and firemen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=195s">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, they're sacrificing in order to be in the front line to save lives, just like they did in 9/11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, the environment has changed drastically overnight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=204s">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where even saying Blue Lives Matter or support of the police is happened, you know, became controversial just overnight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=211s">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is all the more why it's important for us to remember, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=216s">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In order for us to remember the people who've sacrificed, but at the same time, to resolve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=221s">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to remember so that stuff like that does not happen again, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why is, again, for us to remember that we have a common enemy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you guys may remember at that time after it happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=234s">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Democrats and the Republicans stood linking arms at Capitol Hill saying that we're united,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to fight this together, you know, and that was 19 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Compare that to what's happening today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=248s">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's important for us to remember, remember the sacrifices, remember why that happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">remember our common enemy, so that it would affect the way that we view the world today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=259s">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and view the world going forward, so that we are cautioned not to allow that to happen again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=266s">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, all of this to say, this is really, that's really the point that he's getting at, at the text that we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=272s">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Last week we ended with probably the harshest warning that we see in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, he says that if you continue to keep drifting, that there is no sacrifice for sins, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=283s">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=287s">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is a warning of intense judgment that's coming if you don't take this seriously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=292s">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you continue to drift and thinking like this is okay, you know, and he said there's consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=297s">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember, we also said that the reason why he says this is not simply to make you feel bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=302s">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and feel guilty and feel heavy about your walk with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=306s">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to bring sinners to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you are an unbeliever, that there is a judgment, there isn't, you don't just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=314s">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">die and then just go into oblivion. The Bible says that you will meet a judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=319s">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he will judge us based upon all our sins, those that we know of, those that we do not know of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=325s">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But even for those Christians, and particularly for those Christians who are drifting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=329s">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and is not taking it seriously, that I have all the time in the world, whenever I desire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=333s">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just do whatever I want and I'm just kind of waiting to get to heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=337s">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it serves as a warning to take this seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the goal of what he says is really to bring them to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=347s">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why he says in 32 to 39 to remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=352s">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's three things that he tells them to remember. He says to remember the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=356s">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what we're going to be looking at today. And then he says to remember the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=360s">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the reward that's coming with Christ. And then at the end, he says to remember your current state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=365s">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who you are, right? That we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=370s">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember your identity. So it's to remember your past, remember your future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/457610724#t=374s">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and remember the present.
