class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=8s">00:00:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want to just kind of go over some guidelines as to the purpose of this study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=14s">00:00:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and what for you to expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=20s">00:00:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, as I mentioned in the first video that you hopefully you saw, the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=28s">00:00:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of the study is not for me to study it and then for you to come and listen to see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=32s">00:00:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">insights that I've gained through my study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=35s">00:00:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really to get you into the scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=39s">00:00:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's so much you can learn from sermons and hearing other people tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=46s">00:00:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what they've learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=48s">00:00:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible says in 2 Timothy 3, 17, "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=54s">00:00:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=58s">00:00:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">be adequately equipped for every good work."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=62s">00:01:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The part where it says scripture is inspired by God literally means God breathed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=67s">00:01:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a huge difference between hearing from someone else who've encountered God through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=73s">00:01:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the word versus encountering God directly yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=77s">00:01:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the goal of this is to get you into the scripture, not just to be a listener,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=82s">00:01:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but to be students, to study and be able to come to it on your own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=88s">00:01:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It says in 1 Peter 2, 2-3, "Like newborn babies long for the pure milk of the word, so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=94s">00:01:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=102s">00:01:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it says to long for the pure milk of the word, the pure word, not word that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=108s">00:01:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">comes through other people's mouth, not an interpretation from someone else's, but pure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=112s">00:01:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">milk of the word, that we may grow in respect to salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=117s">00:01:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So not just to be satisfied that we're saved, but that we may continue to grow and to mature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=126s">00:02:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what the purpose of the inductive Bible study is, to get you into the word itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=132s">00:02:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the study that we're doing, what I asked you to do last time was to first become familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=142s">00:02:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with the actual letter before consulting any commentaries or historical background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=147s">00:02:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to do as much as we can without going to any other sources, because if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=153s">00:02:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the commentaries, it's no different than hearing sermons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=157s">00:02:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Someone else did the study just telling you what they found.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=160s">00:02:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to be familiar with it as much as we can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=163s">00:02:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to read it, and I asked you to outline it and get the major themes, repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=168s">00:02:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=169s">00:02:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully, you've done that already, but if you haven't, it's not too late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=174s">00:02:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, if you yourself are not familiar with the text itself, then you're always going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=181s">00:03:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to feel like you're just kind of hearing other people's response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=185s">00:03:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the first thing that we wanted you to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=189s">00:03:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then part of the homework was to answer as much of the who, what, why, when, where, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=193s">00:03:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">questions from the letter itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=196s">00:03:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Who wrote it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=197s">00:03:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did they write it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=199s">00:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Who did they write it to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=200s">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">When was it written?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=203s">00:03:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Where was it written?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=206s">00:03:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In what manner was it written?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=207s">00:03:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What genre is it in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=208s">00:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to be able to answer those questions ourselves as much as we can, again, before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=213s">00:03:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody else tells you what they are, so that you can look for it yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=220s">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I asked you to outline the letter to get the logical flow of thought in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=224s">00:03:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">entire letter, not just the text that we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=227s">00:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if Paul is saying something to the Thessalonians, how does that fit into the larger letter and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=233s">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what he's trying to get at?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=235s">00:03:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I wanted you to do that before the study happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=239s">00:03:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully, either you've had an opportunity or you're going to have an opportunity to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=244s">00:04:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">share all of those things that you were able to get to before doing this study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=249s">00:04:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to give you some large outlines of the letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=254s">00:04:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, hopefully you've done this yourself, but just to kind of give you some guidance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=260s">00:04:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=261s">00:04:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The letter, again, this is not the only one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=264s">00:04:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">These are certain ways that you can look at the letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=267s">00:04:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The letter is divided into two major sections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=270s">00:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the first section, which is the narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=273s">00:04:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul describes a lot about how he came to Thessalonica, what he did, how he worked night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=278s">00:04:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and day, and how he loved them, how he served them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=281s">00:04:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the first part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=282s">00:04:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of gives us a background in the relationship that Paul had with them and how the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=288s">00:04:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">had its effect on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=289s">00:04:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second part is the exhortation, chapter four and five, where he goes into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=296s">00:04:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">abstain from sexual immorality, that this is God's will to hope for the second coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=303s">00:05:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=304s">00:05:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the exhortation happens in the second part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=308s">00:05:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not divided by indicative and imperative, but the indicative is kind of given in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=313s">00:05:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">context of a narrative instead of a straight teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=317s">00:05:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=318s">00:05:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see the outline in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=320s">00:05:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">For another way to see it is a major breakdown of the letter in three parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=330s">00:05:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">First is the work of faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=333s">00:05:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, he describes how the gospel came to the Thessalonians and their response and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=338s">00:05:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">genuine faith of how they received it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=341s">00:05:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second part is the labor of love, where Paul talks about his relationship with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=346s">00:05:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">them and how he labored for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=348s">00:05:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">He went above and beyond just teaching the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=352s">00:05:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third part, chapter four and five, is calling to steadfastness of hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=359s">00:05:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's talk about end times and how certain things must happen before Christ comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=364s">00:06:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">back.</span></div><div

letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=384s">00:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I may or may not have given this to you, but you have access to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=389s">00:06:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to take a picture of this and you know what's coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=392s">00:06:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So next week, our study is going to be verses one through five, which is Paul's ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=399s">00:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the love for the Thessalonians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=402s">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it describes a bit about who he is and what he's doing with the gospel ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=408s">00:06:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just for your

thought that Paul is using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=423s">00:07:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to write this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=426s">00:07:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that again, when we jump into verses one and five, we'll have the context of what he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=431s">00:07:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is saying instead of just jumping into it blindly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=434s">00:07:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=436s">00:07:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to give you some background information about the city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=441s">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thessalonica is right here, if you can see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=451s">00:07:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul had three missionary journeys, but second one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=454s">00:07:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you remember, Paul, actually, by the time he gets over here in Asia, he wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=461s">00:07:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to come to this area, but the Holy Spirit prevented him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=464s">00:07:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he was in this, he ended up going over to Troas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=470s">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he has a vision from the Spirit of Jesus telling him to come to Macedonia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=476s">00:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why he crosses over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=479s">00:07:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he ends up in Philippi and the persecution in this area is pretty intense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=485s">00:08:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he gets jailed, beaten, and then he's basically going from city to city as he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=490s">00:08:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">being chased out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=491s">00:08:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he ends up in Thessalonica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=495s">00:08:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And in Thessalonica, he's only there for three Sabbaths, meaning he's in the synagogues teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=501s">00:08:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=502s">00:08:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says that many people ended up coming to Christ as a result of his preaching the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=507s">00:08:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel, but persecution was so intense, he ended up having to leave abruptly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=514s">00:08:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so from there is where he comes to Berea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=517s">00:08:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, Berea, again, is mentioned in Acts chapter 7 and 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=523s">00:08:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, he ends up going to Athens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=527s">00:08:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how he ends up in Thessalonica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=530s">00:08:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So Thessalonica probably was not in his initial plan to get there because, again, he wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=536s">00:08:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay in the Asia Minor area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=539s">00:08:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, the Spirit of the Lord directed him toward that path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=543s">00:09:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Thessalonica, Philippi becomes one of the churches that he gets very attached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=548s">00:09:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to and bears quite a bit of fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=554s">00:09:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of like the background behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=556s">00:09:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thessalonica is actually a very large city in that area.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=571s">00:09:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The letter that he writes to Thessalonica is one of the earliest of letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=575s">00:09:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the only other letter that was written before this is the letter to the

letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=587s">00:09:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second earliest letter is Thessalonica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=592s">00:09:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the letter to Thessalonians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=595s">00:09:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again as I mentioned, it's the capital of Macedonia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=597s">00:09:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not a small city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=607s">00:10:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like most of the metropolitan cities, the city was known for its pagan rituals and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=611s">00:10:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sexual promiscuity, which was again very common at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=615s">00:10:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Paul came and began to preach about Christ and people began to convert, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=621s">00:10:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a direct offense to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span

preached the letter, preached the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=776s">00:12:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel, how he handled himself while he was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=781s">00:13:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What did he do about setting an example?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=784s">00:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if you want to learn about how Paul did missions work, again, chapter 2 is a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=790s">00:13:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">letter to go to, great chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=793s">00:13:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's shepherding heart, he didn't just preach the gospel and leave and say, you know, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=797s">00:13:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">done my job, but he genuinely loved them with the love of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=801s">00:13:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we see that in chapter 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=804s">00:13:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 4 is persevering in sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=809s">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that you're a believer, what does that mean in application in your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=814s">00:13:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he gives exhortations and how they ought to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=817s">00:13:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then obviously the second coming of Christ in chapter 4 and chapter 5, and it says that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=824s">00:13:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some of them actually fell asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=825s">00:13:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they say fell asleep, obviously they're talking about some dying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=829s">00:13:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And in context, it looks like some were actually being killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=832s">00:13:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the persecution was very intense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=835s">00:13:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't just, you know, they were having a hard time eating somewhere, actually dying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=841s">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of this persecution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=843s">00:14:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these are the major themes that that kind of outlined this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=848s">00:14:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=850s">00:14:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to get you started in verses one through five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=855s">00:14:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to kind of show you, you know, one of the things that I do that for me personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=861s">00:14:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">helps me to understand the thought flow of what's going on in the immediate text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=866s">00:14:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're looking at verses one through five, and I've already divided it for you because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=871s">00:14:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't figured out how to move the text while I'm recording, but I've already moved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=876s">00:14:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=877s">00:14:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I did was I divided the thought flow, meaning whenever there's a comma, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=882s">00:14:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a preposition or transitional phrases or certain things that are, you know, main themes or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=888s">00:14:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sub themes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=890s">00:14:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I kind of usually this is what I do in every before I do every sermon or go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=895s">00:14:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">every text is to kind of get the thought flow by doing this on my computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=900s">00:15:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at it, it's a Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, obviously, then there's a comma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=905s">00:15:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is part of the introduction to the Church of the Thessalonians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=908s">00:15:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the reason why this helps me is because I see line by line his thought process instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=914s">00:15:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of just seeing it in one big, one big statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=918s">00:15:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can kind of lose the main point of that when you're seeing four or five sentences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=922s">00:15:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=924s">00:15:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But by dividing the words and the phrases this way, immediately when I look at it, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=928s">00:15:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can tell like, oh, Paul is talking to the Thessalonians and he's saying in God the Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=934s">00:15:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=936s">00:15:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then his actual greeting is grace to you and peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=941s">00:15:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just verse one, but that helps me to see his thought flow, his main point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=947s">00:15:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that, OK, the second verse, we give thanks to God always for you, all of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=954s">00:15:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, there's a comma making mention of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=956s">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever there's a comma or there's a there's a linking like a preposition, then I usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=964s">00:16:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just put it in the next line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=965s">00:16:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if if it's a sub point, I will put it underneath it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=969s">00:16:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then to make sure that when I look at it, I can say, oh, he's starting a new thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=974s">00:16:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then here's a supporting idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=977s">00:16:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm praying for you and we're always thinking of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=982s">00:16:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Thankful for you making mention of you in our prayers, constantly bearing in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=985s">00:16:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So in in our prayer, in our thoughts, work of faith, labor of love and steadfastness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=991s">00:16:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=992s">00:16:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I see that just written out like that, it's like that really kind of stands out because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=997s">00:16:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">faith, love and hope is a common theme in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1001s">00:16:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see that being repeated over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1003s">00:16:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So being able to see that right on the on the letter helps me to understand what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1009s">00:16:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">getting at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1010s">00:16:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so I'm I'm praying for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1011s">00:16:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And whenever I think of you, I think of your faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1013s">00:16:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of your love and I think of the steadfastness of hope in Jesus Christ again in the presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1018s">00:16:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of our God and father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1019s">00:16:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know that this is also part of the introduction, because in God, the father and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1023s">00:17:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord Jesus Christ, and he ends first three in the same way in the Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1028s">00:17:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the presence of God, the father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1030s">00:17:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1031s">00:17:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's trying to make sure that that his, you know, his main thing that he is saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1037s">00:17:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is that this is all in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1039s">00:17:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1040s">00:17:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a response to Christ response to God's presence among them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1044s">00:17:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then verse four, knowing brethren beloved by God, his choice of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1049s">00:17:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He says he knows that God chose them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1052s">00:17:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he gives the reasons behind that for our gospel did not come to you in word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1055s">00:17:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1059s">00:17:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So he says, these are the things that I see in your response to the gospel, which gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1064s">00:17:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">me assurance that you are chosen by God because the word of God did not come to you just word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1069s">00:17:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">only, but in demonstration of the power and with full conviction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1073s">00:17:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he talks, begins to talk about his own ministry, just as you know, that what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1077s">00:17:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1080s">00:18:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we have, um, the gospel that he preaches their response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1086s">00:18:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the, the messenger that brought the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1089s">00:18:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, when you look at this kind of, uh, thought flow, it is much easier to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1096s">00:18:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of hone in on the main points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1099s">00:18:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1100s">00:18:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at versus one, uh, you know that that's the introduction two and three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1105s">00:18:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the thought is connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1107s">00:18:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1108s">00:18:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could say it's, it's all connected, but the, there's a much closer connection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1112s">00:18:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">between verse two and three, and then again in verse four and five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1116s">00:18:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's easier for me to kind of hone in on and ask certain questions and do some digging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1122s">00:18:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is whenever I do inductive study or prepare for sermon, this is the very first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1126s">00:18:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that I do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1127s">00:18:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, because it'll kind of, it'll help me to organize my thoughts and see the text in major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1133s">00:18:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">themes and then sub themes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1136s">00:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it kind of highlights, um, certain things that I

five, obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1257s">00:20:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the introduction and then Paul jumps

evidence of assurance that, that he has so that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1286s">00:21:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he prays for

again, so these are good questions that will lead to better observations and interpretation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1298s">00:21:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then obviously the, the final part after you've done the observation interpretation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1302s">00:21:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is the application, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1305s">00:21:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In application, we ask what insights did I gain about God and the gospel?</span></div><div class="c"><span

what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1314s">00:21:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">should I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453749600#t=1323s">00:22:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So what did I learn about God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
