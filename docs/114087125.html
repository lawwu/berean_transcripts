effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=249s">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everybody's scrambling to, what are we doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=253s">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the traditional way of doing ministry isn't working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of a sudden, we start hearing these rumors about this one particular church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=261s">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I'm not going to name, of how they're being effective in reaching the young people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=267s">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how this

teach this in seminary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And started to teach the young pastors who are being trained in seminary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=287s">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is what we ought to

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=314s">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in this crisis, it kind of caused the church to take a step back and look at it and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"What are we doing different?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=321s">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's been over 20 years since that movement came in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=324s">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember first time hearing about this, there was a lot of debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114087125#t=328s">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember learning about this in
