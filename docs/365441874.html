the question how did his thought get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=177s">00:02:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=178s">00:02:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well remember that in chapter one, Apostle Paul in just kind of almost incredible fashion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=185s">00:03:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">expressed his heart, expressed his desire, and what I like to say is he expressed his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=190s">00:03:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hope in Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember what he said is, "To my earnest expectation and hope that I will not be put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=196s">00:03:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to shame in anything, but that with all boldness Christ

what was pretty amazing was that this hope, this hope of being a shining light,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=217s">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a hope of being an exaltation of Christ was something that helped him interpret or make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=233s">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he spent a lot of time in chapter one talking about this incredible hope that carries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=238s">00:03:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through to the rest of the passages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=241s">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in chapter two, he commanded and encouraged that we should have this attitude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=248s">00:04:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=253s">00:04:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=259s">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">intent on one purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=261s">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=265s">00:04:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">as more important than yourselves.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=273s">00:04:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=279s">00:04:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So he describes that this attitude of humility, this attitude of self-sacrifice, selflessness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=285s">00:04:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this attitude that is found in Jesus where he did not regard his deity to be grasped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=291s">00:04:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and held onto, but he emptied himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=293s">00:04:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "You have that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=295s">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the last passage that we studied two weeks ago, he said for us to join in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=303s">00:05:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=305s">00:05:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What he says was, "But even if I'm being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=309s">00:05:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=315s">00:05:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your

the last paragraph by saying, "Share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=326s">00:05:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this joy with me," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=329s">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He wasn't just saying like, "Be happy, man," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=331s">00:05:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what he was saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=333s">00:05:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He's actually all that he was saying from chapter one till now, he wants them to experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=338s">00:05:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the full gamut, which means then, yes, joining in the hope that is in Christ, joining in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=345s">00:05:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the attitude that is with Christ, but also then the work of Christ that involves suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=351s">00:05:51.160</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/365441874#t=360s">00:06:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it totally makes sense that as his mind is there saying, "Join me, share this</span></div><div
