Thank you. my brethren to come to Christ and you could see the passion that he had and then second Timothy 2 10 says for the reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory so I remember when I was young in ministry and actually it was before I entered into ministry I prayed to God that he would give me brokenness for the lost because I knew what he was calling me into and I didn't know if I can do this unless he really gave me a heart for the lost right like how am I going to endure what I saw my parents endure if if it's just out of obligation and so I remember praying earnestly every time we had a prayer meeting I would pray God give me a brokenness for the lost let me let me genuinely cry out for them and I remember God opened my eyes and started giving me compassion for them and in this one particular day I was driving in my car and I was in the middle of traffic and I was watching all of these people and all of a sudden hit me like a ton of bricks the majority of these people are going to be judged when they die and I remember just being broken over that thought and coming before the Lord in prayer and then that kind of led me to pray earnestly to evangelize whatever I preached and that is what compelled me to enter into ministry but now that I've been in ministry for so many years you know it's easy to see my heart get hearted and that this is something I've done for 35 plus years and so one of the things that I I'm genuinely asking for is for prayer for brokenness because otherwise at at this stage of my life I can just ride whatever we have we have church things are going great bills are paid but obviously that's not why we're here like I want to continue to do the work that God has called us to and uh and again I know the difference between just doing the work versus genuinely being broken for the lost so that's my first prayer the second prayer is to have a sense of urgency to spread the gospel like I said because our church has been around for 28 going on 29 years I've been in ministry another uh seven eight years above that and maybe a bit more than that that sometimes because we're not a church plant and that there is no sense of urgency yes we need to preach the gospel we need to build a healthy church but um second Thessalonians 3 1 it says finally brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord would spread rapidly and be glorified just as it did also with you and I was meditating on that while we were out in Korea and I confess yes I want to spread the gospel I want to know people to come to Christ but is there a sense of urgency am I aware of the time limit that I have that you know that's why the psalmist says I'm praying that you would help me to number my days so that you would give us give me a heart of wisdom and so to have a sense of urgency to see the lost come to Christ so that I don't live my life thinking I have all the time in the world when my kids are you know this or when my bills are paid or when we have more time but really be able to see if Christ comes you know in the near future you know am I living in a way where I'm not going to look back and say oh I wish I had another year or five years or ten years and so again in Colossians 4 3 to 4 says praying at the same time for us as well that God will open up to us a door for the word so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ for which I also have been in prison that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak and I think about Apostle Paul how in such a short period of time he literally poured his life out to preach the gospel and he was able to plant all those churches and then when he finally died he died in the context of trying to get the gospel out right sometimes you can get so caught up in our families and you know do we have enough money are we raising godly children and and all of these things are necessary and important things but sometimes that becomes the main primary thing that I commit to and not realizing that the ultimate call for every Christian and even raising our children is in the context of the Great Commission and so my prayer is that God would give me a sense of urgency that we don't just be satisfied you know everything's going well at church the church is still growing but to really be able to see the world through God's lens and that there would be a sense of urgency in my heart to spread the gospel as rapidly as possible and I do want to spread the gospel but I need to have a sense of urgency and I want our church to have a sense of urgency to preach the gospel and then third and finally a love for the church right and it's not because I don't love the church but I know the difference between working for the church caring for the church but genuinely loving the church Galatians 4 19 20 my children with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone for I am perplexed about you and even as he is writing this letter you know Corinthians Galatians you know so many of Paul's letters are written because he's addressing an issue but considering how many churches he planted you would think he would just kind of shake off the dust and then move on and say you know I got so much other work to do but he really labored and prayed because he genuinely cared for them and you know I again you know I'm going to share but first that's only one two to three pauses we give thanks to God always for all of you making mention of you in our prayers constantly bearing in mind your work of faith labor of love and steadfastness of hope right again work of faith but do I have labor of love and I as I examine my own heart because I've been in ministry for so long for at least many years that I have you know a lot of memories some are very good and some are very bad and as a result of that I catch myself sometimes like deliberately hardening my heart I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm going to end up experiencing what I experienced in the past and so because of that I can do the work but I resist loving right I catch myself saying I don't want to love because if I love I put myself in a place where I'm vulnerable and if I'm vulnerable and I'm allowing myself to be in a situation where something some bad very painful memories in the past you know I don't want to experience that again and so I catch myself sometimes deliberately keeping people at bay I can't do ministry that way I want to be able to be an extension of Christ and so this is something that I wrestle with you know and like there's a temptation in my heart to just ride this out to the end you know and hopefully nothing bad happens and I'll just I'll just do the best that I can until my time to retire comes but you know I'm not here to do a job I'm here to be an extension of Christ and I can't do that if I can I can't share his heart I can't share his love and so I catch myself sometimes deliberately keeping myself at bay for that reason and so that's my prayer that's not something that I can turn on and off that's something that I have to pray that God would allow me to to be an extension of who he is to the church as well not just to the lost in fact it's easier for the lost because the lost you just share the gospel and you celebrate and then you move on but it's much harder to love the church because we share our lives together we rub shoulders together you know we you know anyway I don't want to take too much time but if you can take some time to pray for me specifically that I've been wrestling over my own heart right I want to see the gospel spread but I have to be a vessel that God can use and so that's something that I I wrestle with and ask ask for your your prayer so if I can ask you to take some time to pray for about five minutes and then uh pastor sung will come up and he will share his prayer request okay so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so , so so so so so so so so so so so good good evening church uh first I want to say um how grateful I am to be standing up here to share my prayer request with you um I stand amazed at our God who showed me such grace um um not only has he ransomed my wretched soul but he has grafted me into his body and given me an extended family within the church where I could stand before you and share my prayer request with you asking you to shoulder some of the burdens that we have as pastors and and we're truly fulfilling the law of Christ as we do that I'm so privileged and thankful that I have hundreds of saints praying for me praying for the pastors here um and we're just so privileged and thankful for that um having said that the first prayer request that I have is for discernment to lead the college ministry um I had never imagined myself overseeing the college ministry um if I'm being honest with you this evening I felt a bit timid when Pastor Peter told me that I will be assigned to the college ministry Pastor Nate he has done such a wonderful job with this ministry that I felt that the standard was set really high and so the fear of coming short of expectations and disappointing others it often plagued my mind and that had to do with the fear of man that had to do with me wanting to please man and so those thoughts often plagued my mind and I have to constantly remind myself that God did not give us a spirit of fear or timidity but of power and of love and of discipline and that I should fulfill my ministry as one who has been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ speaking the word of truth not as pleasing men but God who examines our heart and so I have to keep reminding myself of that truth since I've been in college ministry I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by an amazing team of staff and student leaders they have helped me tremendously as I transitioned into college ministry and I'm very grateful to God for them I'm also thankful to our college ministry all our students made me feel really welcome and made the transition very smooth and they have accepted me in and I know this because prior to going to retreat few of the college students approached me and asked me if it would be okay for me to room with them at retreat and so I kindly declined because I told them I have to room with my wife but you know that made me feel welcome and I and I truly appreciated that but you know having inherited this amazing ministry I do ask the Lord to give me an understanding mind to oversee his people that I may discern what is right and wrong and to exercise faithful oversight of God's people because I know that I have been entrusted with the precious souls of the Lord's redeemed people and and and I want to do what is right before the Lord and so if you could pray for me that I'll have discernment to lead the college ministry and secondly diligence in prayer and reading scripture amidst a busy schedule so summer system has begun and with the quarter system approaching college ministry will continue to be busy and um just on a side note I forgot to add it there but our collegians are out on campus this week and next week and we're inviting collegians to come to our welcome week event but in addition to flyering we're also evangelizing to students on campus and having been on campus with our collegians I'm just so thankful to God that they have the passion for evangelism that they're being obedient to the great commission to go out there and making disciples and so if you could continue to pray for our collegians as they're faithfully on campus in this hot summer heat sharing the gospel that that the Lord will keep them but as the college ministry continues it's gonna get busier and so I ask that you please pray for me that I remain sharp and focused by the word of our God during the school year I believe like all of you here this evening that everything that pertains to life and godliness is in the inspired scriptures and so I firmly believe that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of our God but knowing myself I can get easily distracted by the task and the assignments that are before me I like to get things done I don't like to leave things undone and so with that kind of an attitude I can get distracted and sometimes neglect my reading and prayer time but I don't want to neglect my time and reading of God's word or or prayer and communicating with him because I know like the scripture says man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God and so I ask that you pray for me that I will always make God my number one priority that he comes first in every decision that I make and that no matter how busy it gets I want reading scripture and prayer to be my number one priority and third my devotion to wife family and the church I want to have a well-balanced devotion to my wife to my family and to the church I don't want to conflate the three thinking that serving one is serving the other I want to have a proper distinction of every relationship in my life and serve faithfully in each and so I ask that you pray for me that I will continue to be a faithful husband a faithful pastor a son a brother and a friend I remember my official first two months at Berean as a pastor I enjoyed every minute of it and I still enjoy every minute of it I love being at church like I love being here but one day my wife Becky told me that the transition was a bit challenging for her beginning of this year I was on my sabbatical and I'm not an easy person to hang out with and so I was home most of the time and Becky just wanted me out of the house so she said look go mountain bike do something just don't stay here and so she asked me to leave the home a few times so she could focus on her work because I keep bothering her every time I read a devotion I interrupt her and says look what it says here and she's like I'm in my meeting but since I have been at church she told me that the transition has been challenging because she misses me I know that's TMI um but she says she misses me and I and I could see her shaking her head right now but but you know I was reminded to be sensitive to the needs of my wife and not to neglect my duties as her husband because in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 it tells us husbands love your wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her and so I ask that you pray for me that I'll be reminded of my role not just as a pastor at a church but a husband a son a brother and a friend and that I will show my faithfulness in every relationship in my life not to neglect my duties and so those are my prayer requests for this evening so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so okay Okay I'd like to take a moment to share my prayer requests as well as a first request please pray for wisdom I feel especially now in this kind of season of my life a desperate need for wisdom in every single facet of my life actually thinking about church ministry you can imagine there are a lot of just ministry plans what do we do about this event there are a lot of questions about what do we do about these people and more than ever and more than ever I feel a sense of like almost paralysis sometimes these days where you'll catch me just I don't know what do we do last year you know like that kind of just feeling stuck and I'm just sharing honestly that sometimes I I can't even tell like what's the issue is it just fear that plans may fail is it fear that if you know we deal with a certain person this way they'll hate me it's probably all the above so my prayer request actually is I don't know if just because my mind is muddy and I need more focus but I just pray for wisdom the kind of wisdom that fears God first quick to consider him a kind of fear that you know a kind of wisdom that considers the people that we're serving a kind of wisdom that considers what's good biblically you know and not just actually from experiences of the past not not just simply from questions of what what was good in the past and what what did we do last time but actually spiritually good and this translates immediately into a lot of the counseling that I do please pray that I would be wise like truly spiritually wise and the council I think that kind of false folly of well you're just like this person so I'm going to say to you exactly what I told this guy or something like that can can be something that I fall into as a pitfall but you know my request is that you would you would pray for a kind of wisdom that's truly observant of the need of the moment for each individual that cares deeply about their soul and is giving guidance that actually applies that is from the scripture that is truthful and filled with love and then in just kind of generic wisdom wise I do sometimes feel like man I I need wisdom just to manage myself like wisdom to manage my own priorities which is wisdom to manage what focus should I have just as pastor sung mentioned we have various roles God has gifted us with to be a husband to have that role and have the ambition of building up a healthy family and just out of just sheer distraction or lack of focus sometimes you know those things can really fall by the wayside so my prayer request is first and foremost for this that I would have a sensibility where I can have my eyes open I'm alert and I could feel and know the need of the hour okay the second request that I have is my parents more and more I'm concerned for them my father's reaching into maybe I think is 83 my mom's close there and I can hear just more and more of you know their own angst because they're both lonely they're they're both physically experiencing difficulties and then but my request for me is sometimes I hear it and I'm just like okay and then I don't know what to do you know my prayer request is that I would have an ambition to be as a faithful son to minister to them to the best of my ability to be present for them and it's weird because I am the youngest I'm giving them life advice is like hard I talk about you know fear of the words you say and fear of how how to be of encouragement but I have concern for their faith I I want them in their later years to actually have assurance I want them to be strong in faith and then yet sometimes honestly speaking I am pretty scared to speak to them you know so my prayer request is for boldness and faithfulness as a son to minister to my parents and then finally as you guys know I'm a youth group pastor and I have been so challenged by the youth group students because lately I've been seeing so many youth group students come close to understanding gospel a lot of youth group students are giving their lives to Christ and and being converted and in the midst of that my prayer request is that God would use me I'm on the pulpit with our teachers regularly but my two sons are sitting there within the congregation of our of our youth group and they're looking at me you know and sometimes I look at them and because I don't want to get distracted I look away but I too again within this kind of circumstance want to have the courage to speak boldly into their lives but my prayer request for that specifically is obviously they see me at home and I want to be such an example for them it's my fantasy to where it's me I can be the one preaching to them I can be the one talking with them and praying with them holding their hands and they repent and they come to salvation um they they're blessed like many of the children all the children here so blessed to receive instruction to receive the teaching to be so close to godly individuals all around so then my worst fear is to be so close but then so far right so um please pray that God would use me and my wife to be that shining light of glory for my boys thank you thank you so thank you so so thank you so thank you so thank you so so thank you so thank you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so , so so so , so so , so so so , so so so so so so so so so so so so all right it is my turn um there's a lot sorry I hope you saved some prayers for me um moving moving moving on from college ministry and then moving into the band ministry um there's so much similarity so much that is the same uh because at the end of it uh what I would desire uh in our church at large would be uh for God to be glorified but I remember uh early on as I was thinking about BAM and praying uh I was trying to understand again what what does it mean like what would that look like and the prayer that I would have here is uh like as I'm thinking about every event Bible study prayer meeting to be oriented around the desire for God's glory um that that last part there is actually what I would like you to pray for me if you can I know that this means that in my heart and desire needs to first be oriented around the desire for God's glory in my own life uh what would that mean when when when I desire for God to be glorified in the ministry in BAM um if I am not living a life that is glorifying God in my home um if I am not uh if I'm not jealous for God's glory um if I'm not hungering for God to be glorified uh that's something that that really can't be hidden in a way that can't be something that I could just kind of do um in order for for me to be able to be a pastor to this church it means that my desire can't just be for our church to glorify God it means first that I need to glorify God and for me to glorify God means that I need to desire God's glory and so if you can pray that I would have a jealousy for God's glory in my conversations with people that uh that my number one desire would be for God to be honored not just for things to look the way they're supposed to look but that I understand like God's heartbeat something specific you can pray for is that that I would engage in things that bring God glory again I know that sounds very similar but if it would help to put it this way I don't want to enjoy things that would bring God dishonor I want to only enjoy things that would bring God honor and I want to cultivate those things in my life in my free time and in my desires so many times I don't actually know what's best people ask me when I when I came into BAM a lot of the BAMers were asking like oh what like what do you envision for the ministry and I say like oh I want God to be glorified and then from there I'm like God what do I do like what does that look like how do I go about it and so please pray that that in my own life my desire for God's glory would be high secondly if you could pray that I would not be a people pleasing people fear but a God pleasing God fear in many decisions there's a temptation to function off of people's opinions but at the end I answer to the Lord I want to be able to listen to people and address what I can but not be swayed in my faithfulness to the Lord and so in essence I want to make sure that I'm the same person with you that I am before God first that temptation is heavy and it doesn't always look the way I thought it would look that desire to be liked and appreciated in those places where like the counseling and the teaching that needs to come is sometimes there's a lot of dissonance there and so if you could pray that my fear of God would be genuine and it would happen not because I know that God is to be feared but because I'm near to God and as I'm near to God that my fear of him would grow I was really thankful for the sermon this past Sunday but just a reminder that who I am before God that it would begin to kind of show in all the things that I do so in my evangelizing and my teaching and preaching and my counseling that my fear of God would be primary and lastly if you could pray for a growing love for Christ by default if I'm not sober I have a tendency to operate dutifully when I'm tired I want to be careful of my heart's tendencies to drift towards things that will take my mind off eternal matters with this please pray for a growing heart for the lost and what I mean here is I know that I am called to love God with all my heart soul mind and strength I know that that is the commandment that I have to love him with everything that I have but there is a temptation in me to sense my own weaknesses and pull down those demands to something that is attainable by my own efforts I'm incredibly weak and I've seen that more and more every year of ministry that I have been in I feel like I see myself much clearer than I ever have and for so many years there was something inside of me that would say I know I'm to love Christ but I don't want to live my life saying I know what I'm supposed to be and I want to be able to say that Christ is the one I love with all my heart soul mind and strength it's true but I need that to grow because that falters and I'm so weak in that you know the place that I feel like I sense that the most is is actually a home because my love is so weak and I know that I love because God first loved me and so in my desire to understand Christ's love I ask that you would pray that God would help me to see his love for me too I forget that very often and I run very dutifully and I have a list of things that I want to be of a pray that God would remind me of his depth of love for me that I might be able to love my family I might be able to love you as the church the way that I know I'm called to love so if you could pray for those three things for me I'm to I'm to love to I'm to I'm to to I'm to to to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I'm to I don't know.</p><p>I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, if I can get you guys into groups of four, okay? If you can just turn around where you're at, you can come to the front and sit in the front if you want. But if I can get you guys into groups of four, then let me share the four prayer requests we have for this evening, corporate prayer.</p><p>And then after a time of prayer, our praise team is going to come up and he's going to finish us. We're going to finish up the thing. So can you turn around, grab four people around you, and when I see you in your groups, then we'll share the four prayer requests.</p><p>If you're cramped, if you're cramped, you can come up to the front and sit in the front if you want, if you have good backs. Okay. Okay. If you want more space, you guys can just come up to the front. There's plenty of seats. You can sit on the ground.</p><p>Okay. All right. So there's five things out there, but number one is basically we'll give you some time to share your prayer requests with the people with you. And then number two, we're going to pray for the upcoming college students who are coming into town. Just like Pastor Sung mentioned, the semester schools are already starting.</p><p>And I guess obviously you guys know that every year when that time comes around, we have an influx of students that are coming in. And, you know, a lot of the students who are coming in grew up in the church, but they're not Christians. And so it's a great opportunity to share the gospel with them.</p><p>I know that the college group is actively engaged. Pastor Nate is trying to engage our BAM and other parts of our ministry to be aware that it's not just like college student coming. These are souls that are coming into our church, many of them who do not know Christ, that we would have the mindset of evangelizing and sharing the gospel with them.</p><p>So if they're lost, they don't know Christ, they're coming to church because maybe their parents are sending them. But again, we always get an influx of non-Christians coming into church so that our whole church will be mindful of that. Number two. Number three, pray for our upcoming Bible study in Genesis.</p><p>That home group, small group leads for spiritual fervency to appoint the members to Christ. And I know that the schedule, you know, having a time at break was great. But through the Bible study that our church may be thoroughly equipped and to grow as a church, and especially for the home group leads and the small group leads, that God would use them.</p><p>And not to be fatigued, but really be able to use this opportunity to build a healthy church. And then number four, pray specifically for the unbelievers in your life. It's hard to pray for people who we don't know if we're not praying for the people that we already know.</p><p>So identify who they are if you get some time to pray for them. And then finally, as you guys have been seeing, every update that we get now, every update that I post on our church Facebook page, there's some sort of beating. So those of you who know, who've been to India, you know who Pastor David is, not Pastor Sake, but his younger brother.</p><p>He was beaten in the village that he went to, so they asked for prayer for him. And so this is a regular occurrence happening in India. So we are headed out there again in January. But if you can pray for our pastors, Pastor, if you know them, those of you who've been there, know them by name, please pray for them and their children.</p><p>We did drop off some money so they can buy some land, so they can build a school, so that the pastor's children could be educated because, again, that funding is being blocked by the local Hindus. And so if you can pray specifically for the pastors who are there and for their ministry and their wives and children as well.</p><p>So those of you guys who remember, last year when we went, while we were there, like a day or two before we showed up, while Pastor Sake was out doing ministry out in the villages, he was gone for about a week, radical Hindus came and tried to burn the house down.</p><p>And so she didn't feel safe while we were there, so she had to be moved somewhere else because Pastor Sake was going to be with us. So persecution has been increasing, but it's becoming more and more intense because everything that they do, the police aren't doing anything about it, so they're much more emboldened than they were before.</p><p>So if you guys can please pray for them, okay? So let me give you guys some time in your group to divvy up the prayer request. Take some time to pray. In about 10, 15 minutes, we'll call you back, and our worship team will lead us, and then we'll close up in prayer, okay?</p><p>So, okay, let me take some time to pray for each other. And again, you have about 15 minutes, and I know it's not a long time, but take about 15 minutes to pray, and then we'll get back together, okay? Thank you. I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.</p><p>I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time. I know it's not a long time, but I know it's not a long time.

Our worship team is going to lead us in final praise.</p><p>If you guys are not done praying, you guys can come back to where you're at and then pray and then it'll be ended there. But as far as our part, I'm going to pray for us and then we're going to sing our final song. And then again, if you want to stay longer to pray with your group, you're welcome to do that.</p><p>So let me pray for us and then our praise team is going to lead us off. Father, we thank you so much for giving us this evening for us to pray. I know, Father, that more than anything else that we can engage in, to know, Father, that our crying out to you, our prayer, Father God, is more powerful than anything else that we do.</p><p>help us, Lord God, to be constantly humble before your throne. Help us to know, Father, that you have called us to be a light in this world, that we would not live our lives centered on our needs and our desires and our wants. Help us, Lord God, to truly be able to pray that your name may be glorified, that your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to see the lost as you see them, that you had so much compassion, Lord God, that you allowed your son to be sacrificed for our sins. Help us, Lord God, that that would never become mundane. Help us so that that would never become simply a memory, but that it would be the source of our strength.</p><p>It would be a source of our worship, our fellowship, our love, and our compassion, Lord God, for the lost. Help us to know the gift that you have given us in this church, that we would not simply end in satisfaction. But I pray, Father God, that that joy may overflow to many people around us, Lord God.</p><p>Lord, we are living in the midst of so much suffering around us. Help us to see them. Help us to cry out to them, for them. Help us to intercede on their behalf. Lord, I pray for the members in our church who are hurting, even now, of their family members that they have lost, for the many difficulties, Lord God, that they may be in.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that you would surround them with your comfort, that your presence, Lord God, would be their healing, and that we would constantly learn, Father God, over and over again, that you are our ultimate source, that we may truly be able to find our rest in you.</p><p>So I pray that all the prayers that we've lifted up, Lord God, knowing that you have heard it, that we would live in faith, that we would be strengthened, and that our Sunday, Father God, this coming Sunday, that we would worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth. So for that end, Lord God, we pray that you would receive glory to your name.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Let's all stand up for the closing prayer. Worthy of every song. Worthy of every song we could ever sing. Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring. Worthy of every breath we could ever bring. We live for you. We live for you.</p><p>In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name above every other name. Jesus, the only one who could ever sing. Worthy of every breath we could ever bring. We live for you. We live for you. Holy, there is no one like you. There is none beside you. Open up my eyes in wonder.</p><p>And show me who you are. And fill me with your heart and lead me in your love to those around me. In Jesus' name above every other name. Jesus, the only one who could ever sing. Jesus, the only one who could ever sing. Worthy of every breath we could ever bring.</p><p>We live for you. We live for you. Oh, we live for you. Oh, we live for you. Sing holy. Holy, there is no one like you. There is none beside you. Open up my eyes in wonder. And show me who you are. And fill me with your heart. And lead me in your love to those around me.</p><p>And I will fill my life upon your love. It is a firm foundation. I will put my trust in you alone. And I will not be shaken. I will put my trust in you alone. And I will not be shaken. Holy, there is no one like you. There is none beside you.</p><p>Open up my eyes in wonder. And show me who you are. And fill me with your heart. And lead me in your love to those around me. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. There is none beside you. Open up my eyes in wonder.</p><p>And show me who you are. And fill me with your heart. And lead me in your love to those around me. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you.</p><p>Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you.</p><p>Holy, there is no one like you.

Holy, there is no one like you.</p><p>Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Holy, there is no one like you. Okay. Okay. Those of you who didn't finish, if you want to stay and finish up your prayer with your small group, you're welcome to do that.</p><p>And then if the rest of us, if some of you guys can help us put the chairs back and so we can get ready for Sunday as well. And then, so again, this room will be open for a little bit until we're done praying. Okay. All right. Have a safe trip back home.</p><p>All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.</p></div></body></html>
