Like many others, I grew up in the church and continued to attend until I was about ten years old. During that time, my parents had converted to Catholicism, and both of my sisters went and founded a different church. I continued to attend various churches, but eventually my ten-year-old mind concluded that there was nothing for me there. I had learned that Jesus loved me, died for my sins, and that I am saved to go to heaven. So why did I have to continue to attend church? It was difficult for me to understand the purpose of attending, and no one at the church has really explained to me this purpose. So I stopped attending. And of course, my determination to continue my faith at home by praying and reading the Bible was very short-lived. I spent all my free time on what most other kids did during that age, which was to play and hang out with friends. I was diligent in my schoolwork and slowly built up my pride upon the worldly knowledge that I have gained throughout the years. There was nothing wrong with my life, and I should have been perfectly content. But for some reason, I felt empty. I think puberty hit me a little earlier than most because I was already starting to have an existential crisis, questioning for what purpose I was working so hard for in school and to please other people. And I believe it was the grace of God that gave me that empty feeling because I started to think about and search for the purpose of my life. God started to guide me closer to Christ with the people around me who would ask me to come out to church with them. I said no in the politest way possible numerous times, but they were very persistent. What really made me go back to church and turn to Christ was my older sister. Ever since she delved deeper into her faith, she would go on a lot of missionary trips, do service at her home church, and pray at home for our family, which I could hear across the thin wall between our rooms. It wasn't those things specifically that made me realize that her faith in Christ has changed her, but it made me recognize the changes in her speech and actions. She was a completely different person, and she would agree with me when I say that she was not a very nice person before, at least to me. The changes in her were surprising, but she seemed so happy, so content, and so hopeful, which was what I was looking for. I instinctively knew that it was the work of Christ in her life, and I wanted him to give me that same hope, so I started to attend my cousin's home church at the age of 14. I was learning about the gospel again, filling myself with head knowledge for about a year, and there were no specific changes in my view of life, but God gave me the heart to continue attending. One day, during group prayer, God convicted me of my sins, the arrogance, pride, anger, lust, all the filth that I filled myself up with in this world, and that was when I finally, finally repented, and accepted him as my Lord and Savior. And I was so grateful that he continued to love me when I was a sinner, and loved me enough to save me from my sins, that my life purpose was changed to equip myself with his word so that I may know and do his will. I was passionate to learn about Christ and the Father, and gradually made time to read his word and pray. And his work in my life slowly started to appear in the way I approached sin. I was not afraid of the consequences of sin, but I was afraid to disappoint the Father who had extended his grace so that I may no longer live in sin. And during my walk in faith, I definitely had many spiritually dry seasons where I had stumbled, but God continued to grip me with his faithfulness, and I now know that there's nothing that can separate me from his great love. Finally, I want to conclude my testimony with an encouraging verse that continues to give me strength to persevere. It is John 16, 33. These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulations, but take courage, I have overcome the world. I often find it difficult to continue in steadfast faith, especially while living in a sin-corrupted world. But I have to regularly remind myself that God works out all things for good for those that love him. He works in the most unexpected ways at the most inconceivable time, and I find myself badgering him for answers and solutions as I struggle with the things that this world throws at me. Even this week has been so far the most stressful and anxiety-ridden week I have had in a series of stressful weeks. But God spoke to me through the very source of my stress, telling me, "Trust my process, my plan, my timing," which was the answer to all the series of anxious and distressed prayers I had given. And the simple answer was what I had already known, which was, "Trust God's timing, trust God's plan, trust God's process, and trust God." Thank you for listening.</p></div></body></html>
