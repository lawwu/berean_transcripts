href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1546">00:25:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">First, the Bible makes it clear, Jesus came to us because we could not go to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1553">00:25:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible says that because of our sin and rebellion, that we were separated from God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1558">00:25:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We were in rebellion. Mankind is in rebellion against God, refusing to acknowledge him as the creator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1564">00:26:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, we have been separated from the author of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1569">00:26:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So this separation isn't simply that we're not able to have a relationship with him, because he's the author of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1575">00:26:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">To be separated from this God means that we have been separated from life itself.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1585">00:26:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">just like we cannot be in the presence of a nuclear reactor when it

us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1593">00:26:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the scripture says, a sinful man in the presence of a holy

and live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1603">00:26:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could not go to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1605">00:26:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Bible says that Jesus veiled his glory and came to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1611">00:26:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It says in Colossians 115, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1619">00:26:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">He is the exact representation of his glory, yet

us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1630">00:27:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, it says God, in Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, God-man, became the perfect mediator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1640">00:27:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want somebody to mediate, you want somebody who understands both sides well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1645">00:27:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996&t=1656">00:27:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ
