href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1546s">00:25:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">First, the Bible makes it clear, Jesus came to us because we could not go to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1553s">00:25:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible says that because of our sin and rebellion, that we were separated from God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1558s">00:25:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We were in rebellion. Mankind is in rebellion against God, refusing to acknowledge him as the creator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1564s">00:26:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, we have been separated from the author of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1569s">00:26:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So this separation isn't simply that we're not able to have a relationship with him, because he's the author of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1575s">00:26:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">To be separated from this God means that we have been

presence of this holy God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1585s">00:26:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">just like we cannot be in the presence

says, no man can see God and live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1603s">00:26:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could not go to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1605s">00:26:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Bible says that Jesus veiled his glory and came to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/658462996#t=1611s">00:26:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It says in Colossians 115, he is the image of the invisible
