href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=56s">00:00:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=58s">00:00:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so as you guys know, as we were studying the book of Leviticus, Leviticus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=63s">00:01:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is one of those books that my guess is if you were to meet other, you know, friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=69s">00:01:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">who are Christians, I mean, very few people have any knowledge about what's in this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=74s">00:01:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think most of you will agree if you were with us for the duration of the study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=78s">00:01:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that not only is it important, it is essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=82s">00:01:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It is essential for us to understand the things that are taught in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=86s">00:01:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a vague knowledge of what Christ was doing through the book of Leviticus, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=90s">00:01:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ shows a lot of the terminology, whether it's atonement, cleansing, pure, impure, tabernacle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=98s">00:01:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like all of these stuff, atonement, all of these things are embedded in the book of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=103s">00:01:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so without it, we start to add our own understanding, our own meaning behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=107s">00:01:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, scripture makes it clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=111s">00:01:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of the reason why I'm going to be jumping into the book of Hebrews is for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=116s">00:01:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I think once we're done with Romans, probably at the end of this year and sometime next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=122s">00:02:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">year, early next year, we're going to jump into the book of Hebrews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=125s">00:02:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And Hebrews is what connects the Old Testament and the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=128s">00:02:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so much of the teaching of Hebrews is the fulfillment of Christ, all of this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=134s">00:02:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to go into all the details, but so much of what's taught in the book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=138s">00:02:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Leviticus and how ultimately it was pointing to Christ and how it was fulfilled in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=143s">00:02:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what book of Hebrews is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=145s">00:02:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to jump into that on Sundays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=148s">00:02:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then most likely on weekdays, we're going to be doing inductive Bible studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=152s">00:02:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you guys who are new to the church, has only been here for maybe last, maybe two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=157s">00:02:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=159s">00:02:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You may or may not have done that, but that's sort of what we've been doing in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=163s">00:02:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to be jumping back into that to kind of, and it's going to require a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=169s">00:02:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">more of your participation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=171s">00:02:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to be just me standing up here teaching you what it says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=176s">00:02:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to kind of work through passage to passage, asking you guys to go and do your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=180s">00:03:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">study and you're going to do a lot of time discussing what you studied in your small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=184s">00:03:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=185s">00:03:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to be guiding that process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=187s">00:03:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=188s">00:03:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm leaning more toward Colossians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=191s">00:03:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I said Thessalonians last time, but I'm leaning toward Colossians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=194s">00:03:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a hundred percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=196s">00:03:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If tomorrow something happens and then, you know, supernaturally I'm directed toward another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=201s">00:03:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">path I might, but I'm leaning toward Colossians just to give you a heads up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=204s">00:03:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in our next Bible study session, it was going to start second week of January,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=209s">00:03:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe most likely we're going to get into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=211s">00:03:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the format is going to be a little bit different because I'm not just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=215s">00:03:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">be standing here lecturing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=216s">00:03:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to give you study questions and show you how to do that kind of study so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=220s">00:03:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you can do that and then participate in your small group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=223s">00:03:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=224s">00:03:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where we're headed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=225s">00:03:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to kind of give us a introduction, Hebrews 8, 3 to 5, it says, "For every high priest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=229s">00:03:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=232s">00:03:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=237s">00:03:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, part of the Leviticus study teaches us that the priests themselves have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=243s">00:04:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly cleansed, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=245s">00:04:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And they constantly had to be consecrated, you know, for them to even serve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=249s">00:04:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what he's referring to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=251s">00:04:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all since there are those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=255s">00:04:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">offer the gifts according to the law, referring to Christ, who serve a copy of the shadow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=259s">00:04:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of the heavenly things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=260s">00:04:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we studied in the book of Leviticus, he calls it a shadow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=265s">00:04:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a reflection of what is actually happening up in heaven, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=270s">00:04:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Moses, he goes up and he sees the heavenly things and God tells them in the book of Exodus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=276s">00:04:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to make a copy of this down on earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=278s">00:04:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we're doing here in the book of Leviticus was, again, a shadow of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=283s">00:04:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the reality that was in heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=286s">00:04:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1, "For the law, since it has only shadowed the good things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=290s">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to come and not the very form of things," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=293s">00:04:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The law was never intended to be the end in and of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=298s">00:04:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The law ultimately pointed to something, which is obviously fulfilled in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=303s">00:05:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It can never, by the same sacrifices, offer continually year after year, make perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=306s">00:05:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">those who draw near.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=308s">00:05:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So God's intent was never through these sacrifices to bring them any closer to God in reality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=314s">00:05:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">because it was just a shadow that was going to point to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=316s">00:05:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is made very clear in the book of Hebrews, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=322s">00:05:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, Colossians 2, 16 to 17, "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=326s">00:05:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in regard

href="https://www.vimeo.com/304255356#t=338s">00:05:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">understand that Christ came and fulfilled all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
