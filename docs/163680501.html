The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=148s">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Babylonians already came and conquered them, but it goes even beyond that. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talks about probably King Cyrus who's come and allowed them to restore back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=157s">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">into Jerusalem, okay? So about 100, 120 years of history already took place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=162s">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and so starting from chapter 40, he begins to look at it and say, "This is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=167s">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done, and this is why I did it." And the whole reason why is now he's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=171s">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to comfort and to restore, okay?

Just like chapter 1 through 39, it's very thematic, so he may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=185s">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">jump back and forth, he may be talking about the restorations of Jerusalem, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=189s">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then go back and then talk about judgment against Babylon. So he'll do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=193s">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">also in the second section, but again you'll notice that the tone has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=197s">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely changed, okay? So if you look at the first chapter, or chapter 40,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 1, "Come forth, come forth, my people, says your God.

Okay, so all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment that was prophesied in the first 39 chapters, he said all of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=214s">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has ended. Okay, again not completely, just historically. All the stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=218s">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">prophesied about the end times obviously hasn't happened yet. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">historical application, he says, "Warfare has ended, that her iniquity is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pardoned," right? All this time saying, "Because of your sins, these judgments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=230s">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are coming." God carries out his judgment, and now they're taken into captivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then now they're returning back to Jerusalem. Okay, so all of that has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=238s">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">already taken place between chapter 39 and 40. "That she has received from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=242s">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord's hand double for all her sins." Right? So as much as they were judged for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=247s">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">their sins, when God restores, His restoration is going to be double,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=251s">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it is that they lost, right? So that's the context in which we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">starting. Okay, so the first question, "Why is a valley lifted up a mountain, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=260s">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a hill made low, to prepare for the coming of the Lord?" Okay, again it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't say within that context, remember we talked about that, how all the roads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=269s">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right, that leads to the, what cities? Cities of refuge. How many cities of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=276s">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">refuge were there? There were six of them, and where were they?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Huh? They're all spread out in Jerusalem, on top of the hills, right? And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=291s">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all Levitical towns, where the Levites basically were the residents in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=298s">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those towns, right? So it doesn't mention that in specifically, but any Jew would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=303s">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">know, and like when talking about the best roads, is talking about cities that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=307s">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the roads that lead to the, to the cities of refuge. But again, when it's talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about the mountains being, being taken down, and valleys being lifted up, what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=316s">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the imagery there? Just making the, making the road easy access, right? So that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mountains, they don't have to climb mountains, they don't have to go down the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=326s">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">valley. What's another metaphor for that? High being brought low, low being brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">high, proud humbled, right? The lowly being, being brought up, right? When I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=341s">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about that, the picture that I always get is in John chapter 3 and 4, where Nicodemus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, he's a spiritually or by, by law, he's kind of on the top of the hill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=353s">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have the Samaritan woman, the next chapter, who's kind of like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=357s">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sin, sinner among sinners, and even other sinners wouldn't associate with her, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=361s">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God interacts with both of them.

So that's the kind of picture we get. It's to make the path to the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=369s">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the easiest and the quickest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=371s">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's another imagery. When we talk about the gospel, you know, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=379s">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">barrier that existed between us and God has been taken away. So again, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=383s">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">another picture of the, of the gospel message, where the roads that were, were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=387s">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">impossible to take, the mountains have been brought low, the valleys have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=391s">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">filled, so that our path to our God has been, has been laid, right? Again, as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=397s">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned, the other imagery is for the, the proud to be humbled and the lowly to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=403s">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be raised up.

The proud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=411s">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the mighty and the honored and the educated, they don't have special access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=416s">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to the kingdom, right?

And when the Babylonians, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1500s">00:25:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was the most powerful empire, probably before any other empire, before the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1505s">00:25:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Roman Empire came, the Babylonians were the greatest empire ever, right? But even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1510s">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they disappeared.

So he has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1529s">00:25:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">absolute sovereign control. That's why he's laying out all these nations have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1535s">00:25:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">come and gone, right?

I remember years ago, a missionary was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1549s">00:25:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sharing about, you know, a book of Revelation, and I said, "Okay, this guy's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1553s">00:25:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go talk about, you know, what the white horse is and all that." But I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1556s">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really encouraged because he was sharing from Revelation, like the end history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1561s">00:26:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And he said, after he shared that, he was basically sharing with us how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1566s">00:26:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Revelation comforts him, because the end history is already determined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1572s">00:26:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not predicting. He's saying like, "Oh, if you make the right choices, and if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1577s">00:26:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you make the right, you know, place the right thing, and if the church works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1581s">00:26:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hard enough, and if we spread the gospel, if we were strategic enough, if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1585s">00:26:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gathered enough, like we're going to be able to do this." He said, "No, that's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1588s">00:26:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what Revelation is saying." Right? Revelation is saying, "This is what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1592s">00:26:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to happen." He conquered, period. Right? He's not saying, "It wasn't a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1598s">00:26:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge to get your act straight, or this is not going to happen." He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1601s">00:26:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, this is determined." Right? And so, he was sharing how every time he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1606s">00:26:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reads the book of Revelation, it kind of reminds him that we're playing a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1612s">00:26:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">part in the way he's carrying his plan out, but in the end, it's already been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1618s">00:26:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">determined. Right? And a source of confidence in that, and in the end, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1624s">00:27:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we get so caught up in what we need to do, don't need to do, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1627s">00:27:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">forget the big picture.

Right? Ultimately, what was the cause of fear?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1649s">00:27:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?

So all this disaster is happening, and so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1726s">00:28:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that happens, they're going to each other and comforting each other, right?

Basically, he's saying that, "I loved you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1922s">00:32:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like Hosea loves Gomer."

So, when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1958s">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the history of Israel and just how often and how many times and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1963s">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">easily they forget who they serve.

God doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1968s">00:32:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just sweep sin under the rug. He disciplines them. But he still, still he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1973s">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "You're my people." Right? Because he made a covenant. He said, "Everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1980s">00:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">else will pass away.

But the Word of God will remain forever." Right? Because he said, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1993s">00:33:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">said, he made a covenant with Abraham. Right? And he is faithful to his own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=1997s">00:33:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">covenant. And so, even now, right, when you understand the context in which he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2002s">00:33:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saying this, even now he says, "You're my people. And anybody who messes with you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2006s">00:33:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">messes with me." Right? "In what way will he protect them?" He said, "I will hold you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2018s">00:33:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with my right hand." Right?

You notice how in verse 14, that even in the context of his judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2073s">00:34:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and restoration, he says, "Fear not, you worm Jacob."

"Your redeemer, kinsman-redeemer, is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2100s">00:35:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy One of Israel.

So, you see how he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2104s">00:35:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "You are a worm, but I will turn you into a threshing sledge, because I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2109s">00:35:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have compassion on you." Right? So, for whatever the reason, because God has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2115s">00:35:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy on you, you start becoming arrogant.

That even in the, even as you're in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2133s">00:35:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">desert and there's no hope for life.

Starting in verse 21, when He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2154s">00:35:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Set forth your case," says the Lord, "bring your proof," says the King of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2159s">00:35:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jacob, "let them bring them and tell us what is to happen.

Who is He referring to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2171s">00:36:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Pause]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2179s">00:36:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Huh? I didn't do "eat"? Oh, okay, I didn't. So, He says, "When He does all of this,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2190s">00:36:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in verse 20, "that they may see and know, may consider and understand together, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2195s">00:36:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the hand of the Lord has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created." So, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2199s">00:36:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He starts in verse 16, "Fear not, you worm Jacob." In other words, don't become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2204s">00:36:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">arrogant because God is being gracious to you. Because, remember what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2207s">00:36:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture says? Right? The constant sin of the nation of Israel and the people of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2212s">00:36:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is when they cry out, God has compassion, He feeds them. When they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2216s">00:36:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fed, they become proud. When they become proud, they forget Him. And when they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2220s">00:37:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">forget Him, they turn to idols. Right? And that's the constant cycle. So, He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2225s">00:37:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm going to restore you, but don't forget it is I who will restore you, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2229s">00:37:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you." Right? That's why, again, I think, you know, as we talked about on Sunday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2236s">00:37:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">justification by faith, right?

So, there's this aspect, like, for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2315s">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it seemed like there was this strength of, like, or a strength of, like, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2320s">00:38:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parent talked to their child, like, "I don't want to punish you.

So, that's, it just, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2331s">00:38:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was my, preserving the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163680501#t=2334s">00:38:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.
