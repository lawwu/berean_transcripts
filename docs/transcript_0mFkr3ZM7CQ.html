So if you guys can find your seats. So we're going to get started in about five, six minutes.                                                              Good evening, everybody. Let's go ahead and start taking our seats. For those of you guys, it's currently 7 who have made it on time. Many blessings to you. We'll judge hard those who are coming late. I'm kidding. Let's go ahead and take our seats today. Just for the sake of those who are farther back into the room, while we worship, we're just going to remain seated. But as you get situated, let's join our hearts in a word of prayer. And then we'll get started with some songs of worship to our God. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we lift up to you our hearts of gratitude and thanks. God, we regularly want to acknowledge what a privilege it is that, God, we know you, that we can hear your word. And God, to hear just of the many blessings you impart to us through your son. Thank you, God, that we have the assurance that, Lord, you know us. And God, you're guiding us. And Lord, ultimately, you have granted to us all things. And Lord, you're leading us that we would be blameless and holy. Father, in this process, God, of growing together, would you truly bless our time invested into learning and sharing and cause it to be fruitful in our faith, Lord. We also lift up to you with our hearts joined and our voices joined together. Our worship may be pleasing to you, Lord. It's in Christ and we pray. Amen.  Son of God, the vapor of the stars, you alone, the dweller of my heart, mighty King, how beautiful you are. How beautiful. Son of God, the Father's gift to us, you alone, we're broken on the altar of love, precious land. Freedom's in your blood. It's in your blood, Jesus. Oh, holy one, I sing to you, forgiven, saved, young, and overcome with your great love for me. God of God, great beyond compare, you alone, the darkness cannot bear. Lord of love, your kindness draws me near. It draws me. Son of God, prophesy of the hope, the longed, the fever of my soul. Again, and lead your people home. Come lead us home, Jesus. Oh, holy one, I sing to you, forgiven, saved, young, and overcome with your great love for me. You are worthy. You are worthy. You are worthy of all my praise. You are beautiful. You are beautiful. I will lift up my hands and sing. Jesus, oh, holy one, I sing to you, forgiven, saved, young, and overcome with your great love for me.  Just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world, that's fine. I feel at ease. I feel at home. Oh, I'm not alone. Then in my rest, there comes a test that shakes me till again I know that what I have is not enough. And again, I've got to grow. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. The full supply I find as I move closer to the heart of God to strengthen me, to nourish me, to fill my mind with him. I've truly grown, but even so, my hunger hasn't gone away. Still I long to feel at first to know him more each day. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you. And Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Thank you. OK. Please go ahead and come on and take your seats. Couple announcements just by way of reminder. The first is that if you search your email for the Second Peter schedule, there is a shared spreadsheet where you can log in your name for volunteer opportunities that include everything from parking to child care and setup and greeting. We're going to send a reminder email out to all the participants here. So please make sure you take a look at that spreadsheet and put your name down. If you feel like you're going to forget, just do it today at the end of our study. The second thing is that today we have a few things going on that need your help. So after the Bible study is done, typically you're in shortly after 9. So around 9, 15, I'm going to give out a call. And we need help in making sure that we get ready for the move of our crime room. So first, we need people in our previous cafe, the crime room now, just adjacent to us. We're going to need help just carrying tables and chairs and clearing out the room. If some of you guys will, after the Bible study is over, head to the current cafe in the sanctuary side, we'll start grabbing chairs, moving it over. And we also need help-- you know those little flip-down tables in the sanctuary? We're going to try to put all those back now that we don't have to keep setting things up and stuff like that. So we have three distinct areas that you can just go right away and start helping. So you know how they say, many hands make the workload light. If you are available, if you guys don't have already pre-scheduled meet-up or something, please make sure you go and lend a hand, OK? For the people who are listening out on the overflow room, let's give them a big round. They're kind of toughing it out over there. I hope you guys hear that. Cool. Just remember, you too have to put away your table and chair after you're done. With that said, at this time, if you would, go just directly into your discussion from your personal inductive study, sharing your questions, observations. At 8 o'clock, we'll circle back together here for Pastor Peter's lesson on the passage say for verses 1 through 4. Thanks, everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                All right, it's 8 o'clock. If I can have you guys come back. I know those of you guys who are in the rooms. Going to wrap up where you guys at. You guys will have enough time to go back. So if I can ask the people in the rooms to come back out.  You'll have time to wrap up your small group afterwards. You'll have discussion time, prayer time afterwards. So if you guys can come back and grab your seats.   Oh, I heard-- what is that? I just had some watermelon. This is my third can. Homemade? Wow.  I don't want to spill it. Oh, it's good. Thank you.  OK, it's 8 o'clock. So we're going to get started. All right, so my goal in doing an overview of the text is not to go through every single meaning of the text, because it'd be redundant. I'm sure you guys already have covered it. So what I'm going to do is kind of highlight some of the things. And then if there are some verses that may be a little bit more difficult to understand, I may spend a little bit more time in that. So as I'm going through, my goal is to kind of show you how inductive study-- at least I do inductive study, and then the insights that I've gotten from that. And then so, again, I may not cover everything that you guys have covered. But that's not my goal. So some weeks I may, some weeks I may not. Next week's-- not next week, but the following week has a lot more verses. But you have two weeks to do it. So if you cram, next week is praise and prayer. So if you don't touch your Bible until right before Bible study, it's going to be probably too much for one week. So you're going to have to break that down into two weeks and kind of spread it out. Do first half one week, and then next week, and then the other half before you come. And then you'll be able to cover all of it. So again, I just want to make sure that you understand that and say, hey, you didn't talk about this issue. Again, so that's not my goal. My goal is to kind of help you to be better students of the word yourself. So I won't be covering everything. But as I mentioned last week, one of the first things that I do when I look at a text that helped me to break down the text is by sentence structure. Simon Peter, obviously he's the main subject, a bond servant and apostle. I'm going to make it a little bit smaller. Can you guys see back there? If I do that, like way back there, you guys can see it? OK. If you squint, well, keep squinting then. All right. Simon Peter, a bond servant and apostle of Jesus Christ. To those who have received-- of faith-- again, there's no one way to do this. This is just to kind of-- when you look at it, you can kind of see the sentence structure. Received a faith of the same kind as ours. You know what, I'm going to have to make this font a little bit. It's not working out. Hold on. Let me do this.  OK.  No, don't need to. I still-- I need more text on that. Yeah, yeah. All right, let me try this again. A Simon Peter-- Simon Peter, a bond servant and apostle of Christ to those who have received a faith. What kind of faith? Of the same kind as ours. Right? How did you receive the same faith? By the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. So for me, when I break down the text like that, it's easier for me to see the thought flow. Because you can see Simon Peter's the one speaking. He calls himself bond servant and apostle. To the people who he's talking to. Right? And then of the same faith, a same kind of ours. A same kind of ours. So these are all like describing each line going down. So when I break it down like this, it helps me to see, oh, this is the thought flow. So it helps me to focus when I'm going into do the inductive Bible study, because the thoughts are separated. Instead of looking at it as one sentence or paragraph, because it's separated like that, it helps me to kind of hone in on the verses. OK? So if you keep doing this as a habit of doing that-- and I know some of you guys may not do this and say, that's not helpful. I would say of all the things that I do for inductive Bible study, Bible study, sermon prep, this is probably the most helpful thing that helps me. OK? So if in the beginning you may think, like, oh, it's a lot of work. I don't get much out of it. I can just do it looking at it. It's like, I would highly encourage you to persevere in that. And if you get in the habit of doing this, I think it will help you a lot. OK? It causes you to slow down, look at the verses, look at each line separately, instead of looking at the whole verse. OK? It's just like, if you memorize scripture, you'll memorize, but there's things that pop out at you when you memorize it versus when you just read it. Right? If you've never memorized scripture before, you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you've memorized scripture, you know that certain words get repeated in your head while you're memorizing. And then the verse sounds very different. Certain things get emphasized that you didn't think about when you weren't memorizing. And so it's the same way in the Bible study. If you're not in the habit of slowing down and just kind of read it, then you're always just kind of skimming the superficial. So this helps me to break down each verse, each word, and then helps me to focus on that. OK? So I'm going to go over this quickly. Grace and peace, that's the subject, be multiplied, how? In the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. Right? Seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything. Everything pertains to life and godliness. How? Through the knowledge, through the true knowledge of him and who is he? Who called us by his own glory and excellence. For by these, these meaning up there, he has granted to us-- what did he grant us? His precious and magnificent promises. Why? So that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world. OK? I'll leave it here. All right, so doing this helps me to see the outline. And then when I-- so before I do any kind of like note taking, this is the first thing I do. So whenever I look at the text, I'm looking at this page, like this. OK? And then from here, I break down. And I'm not going to go through all of it, like Simon Peter. And I start asking questions like, he calls himself bond servant and an apostle. Like, why does he use this title? Because in 1 Peter, he only says he's an apostle. What's the distinction? Another thing that's different between 1 Peter is that-- oh, sorry. He uses Simon Peter instead of just Peter. 1 Peter, he just says Peter. Right? Now, it may not be anything. You may just be like, oh, he's just writing it. There might not be any specific significance to this. But there also may be. Right? So what do we know about this letter that makes this very special? Remember we talked about that last week? What would make this letter a very special letter? It's the last letter. So imagine if you're sitting in prison, and you know you're going to die, and you're writing this letter, knowing that it's your last letter. You probably put a little bit more thought into it. And I would think that you're very conscious of what you're saying. One of the things that-- the distinction between 1 and 2 Peter-- 1 Peter, they believe that they had a-- what was his name? Silvanus. Silvanus was the one who was dictating. He was saying it, and then he was dictating. So it was written in his verbiage. 2 Peter, they believe that Peter himself wrote it by hand. And the reason why they believe that is his grammar and vocabulary is very low. So it's an uneducated fisherman who's writing it. So some people debate that maybe Peter didn't write the second letter, or Peter didn't write the first letter, because the grammar and the education level is very different between 1 and 2 Peter. But there's a clear explanation for that, because 1 Peter clearly says Silvanus was the one who was taking dictation. He was writing it down in his own words, where 1 Peter, they believe that he wrote it himself. So you can think, why would he do that? Because this is his last letter, most likely. He's writing his last letter. So everything he says here, I think he's being thoughtful. So even here-- again, I'm not going to spend this kind of time in every verse. But even here, it's just the title. Even the way he addresses himself, it's interesting, because he calls himself Simon Peter. Remember, Peter is the name that Jesus gave to him. Simon was his birth name. Simon is his Hebrew name, which means hearer or listener. Remember what Peter's name is? Rock. So again, these are just passing thoughts. And I'm thinking Simon Peter. Like, why does he address himself? Some of you guys may have two names, like I do. When I was born, I was given a Korean name. And when I came to the States, some random pastor-- I don't even know who he is-- gave me my name, Peter. All my brothers say, you shall be Paul. You shall be Peter. You shall be Philip. So our names were given to us. And it didn't become my legal name until I was naturalized in, I think, my early 20s. I got naturalized. And so when I got naturalized, I didn't want to use my Korean name, because growing up, living in the East Coast and the Midwest, they didn't know how to pronounce my name. So I changed it, because I was called Peter by all my American friends. And all my FOP friends would call me Con-ho, which is my Korean name. So I always went by two. And so after I changed my name, I'm called Peter. You guys probably never even heard my Korean name. But my legal name is Peter Con-ho Kim. That's my full legal name. So when I write something in legal document, anything that's permanent, anything that requires identification, I have to put my full name on it. Now, I may just be reading into this. Peter may be writing this letter, knowing it's his last letter. And he's putting his imprint on it, because Peter was his given name. And it's common. Simon is also a very common Hebrew name. And by calling himself Simon Peter, I think maybe he's making sure that people know that this is coming from his hands. It's also interesting that the meaning behind this, because the word Simon in Hebrew means hearer, listener. But Jesus says, from now on, you're going to be called the Rock. And so Jesus' name's in that, because he was going to be the first apostle among the Jews. And these two names are kind of like very humble, hearer, rock, the leader. Even the way he introduced himself here, a bond servant, not just an apostle, but a slave of Christ. And so the tone here, even in his introduction, is very humble. He says, I'm writing to you, these people. You have the same faith, same kind of faith that I do. And we were partakers. We were granted this. We were given this. We received this. And so his whole tone is very humble. And if you think about it, Paul's name-- Peter's name that was given to him as a rock, a leader that doesn't move. He said, I will build my church, and gates of Hades will not prevail against it. But was Peter ever known as a rock? You think about it. If you think about Peter's character that's portrayed in the Bible, I mean, it's anything but a rock. He's the guy who jumps out, and he's like, oh my gosh, I'm going to drown. And Jesus has to save him. And he confesses, I will build my church upon this rock. And then next thing you turn around, he's rebuking Jesus. And then he's telling, they're all going to fail, but I'm not going to fail. I mean, he's not a humble man. And then he's the one who denies Jesus to his face, right after he said, I'm never going to deny you. Then even after Jesus is resurrected, remember, Apostle Paul calls him out in Galatians, because he was compromising with the Judaizers. So if you sum up Peter's life by character, he's not much of a rock, right? So he wasn't a humble man. I think he became humbled, right? He was humbled by life, by his mistakes. And so I think even in the introduction, here's a man who said, they're all going to fail, but I'm not going to fail. But even the way he introduced himself in the very last letter, you can kind of see a man who's been humbled, right? And he's kind of telling them, even though I'm writing this to you as an apostle, we have the same faith. Everything I have, you have, right? That's the kind of tone that we see. So I share this because these are type of things that you don't have to be a scholar to know. You don't have to read the commentaries to gain insight. If you just spend time, give enough time in front of the Bible, asking questions, keep digging, digging, digging, you may not find the answer to all of it, but you'll be surprised how much insight you can gain by thinking about it over and over again. And so most of the commentaries that you read are not because they studied the Greek and Hebrews, and they know how to put all the languages together. After you do this kind of study, and you go back to the commentary, you're going to see the same insights that you have, they have. 90% of what they say in the commentaries are just coming from this kind of study, not because of deep insight into Greek or because they know Greek grammar. So I'm not going to do this to all of you, but I'm just kind of giving you some insight so that you can be encouraged in your Bible study. So all of this, one of the main things that I found is the tone of grace. Tone of grace. Everything he says here, he says, you have received this. You have received this. And then he says, this has been granted to you. Oh, did I make it bigger? OK. This has been granted to you. This has been granted to you. We have become partakers, having escaped the crush. So all of this is kind of like description of what God's given us. Not what they have achieved, but what God has given them. So why does he say that? Why does he say repeatedly over and over again, there's no, it's like, we did this, we worked hard. But he begins by saying, everything we have, we've been given. We've received it. It's been granted to us. Now, why does he say that? Considering what we've already read, what's coming. What was the main thing that he's going to be pushing through 2 Peter? Let's review this again. I think three chapters can be broken up into three parts. What's the first part? Pursue sanctification. Be diligent to pursue sanctification. Chapter 2, in your pursuit of sanctification, watch out for these false prophets. They're going to come in and spread delusion. And then third, Jesus is coming. So live like you know that Jesus is coming. So all of it is in the context of work hard. Strive, be diligent, pursue Godliness. So if you look at next week's text, all of it is about adding to your faith, like moral excellence. And so you're supposed to strive after all this. But before he jumps into telling them to strive, what does he remind them? What's the foundation of our striving? God's grace. The foundation of our striving is the grace of God. It's because you've been given the grace of God that you are capable. You're capable of pursuing righteousness. So if you convince yourself that you're not capable, you're denying the grace of God. So according to that, what is the grace of God? According to 2 Peter, what is the grace of God? Your ability to pursue righteousness. It begins by justifying us, but the grace of God is giving you the ability to pursue holiness and righteousness. So if we somehow convince ourself justification is from God, and so sanctification is like, ah, I'm gonna struggle, and I don't have the ability. Some people do, some people don't. And then once you tell yourself that, you've already given yourself an excuse not to pursue it. He said everything that's been, you've been given to it. So if you say, oh, it's easy for them, not for me, what you're saying is God's given them grace, but not me. He says, no, everybody has been given the same grace. If you're a child of God, you've been given the same grace. That's what Paul says. The faith that I have is the same faith you have. So if you say it's easy for you, but it's not easy for me, it's you're basically saying God's grace is abundant for you but God's grace isn't abundant for me. At the end of the day, that's what you're saying, that God's grace isn't enough. Grace is the ability to pursue righteousness. And then, I mean, that's why I believe that this verse is the central verse of this letter. He said grace and peace, right? That's what grace and peace is God's justification. He chooses us, given us, through the grace, He's given us peace with Him. And as a result, He says, continue to multiply this grace and peace. That's our sanctification, which is what He's gonna be getting at the rest of the letter. How are we doing that? Knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ. I believe that this kind of is the central verse to me. It kind of wraps up the whole letter, right? May God's grace and peace be multiplied to you. How? In the knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ. So everything that we need and understand about salvation is contained in this verse, in verse two. Yes? Okay. So I don't know about you, but understanding that empowers me. I think the first thing that deflates my desire to pursue righteousness is the thought that I can't do it, or this too hard for me. It's easy for you, but it's, oh, you're a pastor, so it's easy for you. I didn't become a pastor because it was easy for me. Do you know what I mean? I mean, same human being like you. Everything you have, I have. Everything I have, you have, right? Everything I have, you have. So it's not like there's certain people that's easy to be a Christian, easy to pursue, easy to love, and so those people became pastors and missionaries or whatever, and the rest of us, like, oh, God doesn't expect that. He didn't give us the same grace. He said, no, God has given you the exact same grace. If you're a child of God, you have the Holy Spirit. Everything I have, you have. Everything I'm able to pursue, you're able to pursue. That's why, maybe because I've been studying the Bible much longer than you have, it's easier for me to gain insight to certain things, but I started where you started, and it didn't come because I woke up one day and studying the Bible became easier. It just became more, I don't know how to use the word fun, but it is fun because you, yeah, because you gain, I feel like I gain treasure, and I get to know God more the more I study, and I've just been doing it longer than most of you, you know what I mean? But most of what I know about the Bible came through this, like doing this, but doing this every week for many, many years, right? So this is not unique to pastors or other people, all right? All right, I'm just gonna stop there for the sake of time, and then I'm just gonna give you a little bit of directive. I'm not gonna break up this text for the sake of time, but I'm probably gonna email this out to you, so it's just, I wanna give you some directive for the next text that's coming up. So next text is verse five through 11, and so if you know that text, obviously there's a list applying all diligence, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, love, and whenever you see a list of things like that, slow down and ask, like, is there purpose for the order of this list, right? Like, you know, maybe when you and I write, we may just kind of wing it and randomly put things together. This is written by the Holy Spirit, who has full control, right? Nothing is random. So when you see a list like this, the first thing you wanna ask is, is there a purpose to this list and this order? And in order to know that, you have to know the meaning behind each one. So this is one of those situations where it would be helpful to you to maybe dig a little bit further. And go to, you know, Pastor Peter Chung has been sending out different translations, right? You have the ESV, NIV, NASB, and then I think LSB, and I forgot what other, King James. And so this is one of those things where you wanna look at the different translations and see if it say they use the same word. You understand what I'm saying? See if they use the same, but because if you see certain words that sound very different than the words that's used in NASB you already know that that word is probably difficult to translate with one word. Or there's some sort of a debate as to like, oh, maybe there's several ways to translate this. So every once in a while you'll come into a verse where it'll sound very different from translation to translation. So when you come across something like that it means for you to take your time. There's something going on that even the scholars couldn't be unified in the way they translated it, okay? So when you have a list like this and there's descriptive words, again, slow down, ask questions. Is there a purpose to the order of this list? Why is this word first, right? Why is this word last? And why is it in this particular order? Does the one before it and one after it, does it have some sort of a connection, right? Or is it just random? Pretty sure it's not random, okay? So watch out for that. Are there any parallels or comparisons, right? So if you look at this text, it'll say, if you do this, this will happen. If you don't do this, this will happen, right? So look at parallels, it's comparing. In our pursuit, if you pursue sanctification in this way, it will cause you not to be unfruitful and useless, right? But if you don't do this and you're not pursuing, what does it say, right? You've forgotten where you came from, you forgot what you have. You forgot the grace of God, basically that's what it's saying, right? So look at the comparisons. How is it comparing, you know, and then just chart, you know, where is this taking me? Ask probing questions. This is one of those verses you really wanna ask, the cross-references, okay? So certain key verses, look for cross-references. What do other texts say about this? Because somebody can come out of this text and then say, salvation is by what? Works. If you look at certain language that he uses here, somebody can look at, jump into this text and say, hey, look at this text, it says salvation by works, right? So make sure that you look up verses. And then you have other people say, one saved, always saved, right? So our works doesn't matter, it's just legalism. And so make sure that as you're studying this, that you're able to wrestle with that, right? If somebody was to ask you that, how would you answer that from this text and then go to cross-references, see what it says? Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, so this is one of those texts that you wanna compare with other texts to make sure that you get the full understanding of what he's saying and not just this, okay? Then obviously, like every study that you do, you wanna ask a practical question. How does this apply to you, right? How does this specifically, but don't just approach it academically. Are you pursuing moral excellence, right? Is your knowledge of God growing? Do you have growing self-control? Can you say you've been persevering? Is there godliness? Is there brotherly kindness? And ultimately, is there love? Is it increasing? Not just do you have it, but are you actively pursuing these things? So make sure that every inductive Bible study concludes with application, okay? All right, so you guys have two weeks. Don't cram this, there's too many verses to cram, okay? So let me pray for us, and then you guys can go and finish your Bible study. I think if you have children, you're supposed to pick them up at 9.15, okay? Oh, and then I have, again, some discussion questions. I was debating whether I should give it to you or not, but since we're in the beginning, I may not do this every week, but for today and maybe for the first few weeks, I'm gonna direct you to some discussion questions. Lists all the things that God has given us for the life of godliness. He says everything has been given to you, specific as to what you know the Bible says is given to you for the purpose of godliness, okay? What areas do you think you are weak in? How much of your energy is focused on what you have versus what you don't have, and how does that affect the way you live your Christian life, okay? If we have everything we need for life of godliness, why does it seem so hard to bear fruit sometimes? That's a very practical question. What has caused you to grow the most in your walk with God in the past year or months, okay? So these are some application questions. So if you have your own questions that you wanna discuss, obviously, you're more than welcome to do that, but I'm just kinda giving you some guidance since we're in the beginning, okay? Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys go to your Bible study. Heavy Father, I thank you so much for your Holy Spirit and your living word that you give to us. Help us to glean from your word, not to turn from it to the left or to the right, and especially, Lord God, as we see our culture around us drifting away from you, help us to cling to the truth of your word. We pray, Lord God, that it would truly judge the thoughts and intentions of our own heart, that we may be sanctified, that we may be better worshipers, that we may pursue holiness, Lord God, with all diligence. We praise you and we ask for your blessing over our time of small group. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
