Again, as you guys know, we have Passion Week this week, and so please take as many as you need to pass out and invite people and maybe even begin the conversation. As you guys know, starting from tomorrow, every day we have a devotional starting from Monday through-- even Thursday and Friday.</p><p>So the devotionals Monday through Wednesday is happening at 7:30 p.m., so I encourage you to come a little bit early to find parking. We have certain parking, obviously, during the weekday that are only available during the weekday in certain spots, so there's places-- if you're not used to coming here on the weekdays, the parking spots that we have on Sunday is not always available, so the parking behind us-- we will have it on Friday.</p><p>We have separate additional parking on Friday, but weekdays we have this lot, our lot, across the street, and then there will be shuttle going around, but behind the lot and some of the other lots are not available during the weekdays, so just keep that in mind. Just try to come a little bit earlier.</p><p>We're going to start right at 7:30, and the devotional and the sharing time is most likely going to last about an hour, so just keep that in mind. And then the Passover meal, that one's starting at 6:30, okay? And it's because it's a meal, so if you start at 7:30, it might be a little bit too late, so that's happening at 6:30 this coming Thursday.</p><p>So I'm told that there's a little bit more room if you want to still come to that. That's happening this Thursday, and then obviously Good Friday at 7:30. So Good Friday, we have ample parking, but we are expecting over seven, possibly even 800 people, so that's more than any given Sundays, because we have three services.</p><p>We are spread out, and we typically have a lot of guests that come. So I encourage you to come a little bit earlier. We are going to be having overflow. This room obviously is not going to fit all the people that are going to come, so the cafe area is going to be set up like here.</p><p>So the communion that we will have on Friday will also be taking place in that area, and then the area where the youth group meets, that's going to be reserved for family with small children, okay? So if you've ever been here on Friday during the Good Friday service, you know how packed it is.</p><p>So it's going to be every single seat here and over there is going to be pretty much packed. And so, again, we encourage you to come a little bit earlier. We have plenty of parking, but you're going to have to look online, or when you get here, we'll have attendants kind of guide you and lead you to the proper parking.</p><p>So that's happening this week, and obviously on Sunday we have early rise service at 6, and then right afterwards there's going to be light breakfast provided so that you don't have to go out like we used to before because our service starts at 8 o'clock, and there will be lunch provided after the second and third service if you are there for that, okay?</p><p>All right, so there's a lot going on this week, and I'll explain a little bit more later. There's a membership class that is starting another session on April 21st, so if you need to sign up for that, please sign up for that. And then the service auction, the fundraiser for our summer missions to Korea, the last day to sign up for that is April 6th, so you only have a couple more weeks to sign up for that.</p><p>And then the actual auction itself is going to be taking place on the 21st to the 27th of April, okay? And then, again, the special seminar that we're having for abortion, birth control, and IVF on May 4th, we're going to keep taking sign-ups right up to that Saturday. We want to try to get as many people to come out as possible.</p><p>Sign-up table is outside, so as you're walking outside, there will be a table there, or if you'd rather do it online, you can also do it online, okay? And that will be taking place at 9 to 12 p.m. that Saturday, two sessions from Pastor James Lee from Cross Life Bible Church, okay?</p><p>I think that's it for now. Again, just a reminder that our Zelle and, you know, other avenues for online giving is going to be switched to Subsplash. So we have this week and next week, and then after that, starting from April, we're only going to be exclusively doing Subsplash.</p><p>So if you haven't done that yet, we encourage you to do that, okay? And those of you who are visiting us and you have a physical offering, there is a physical offering in the back. As you're going out, you'll see the box in the back. All right, let me pray for us, and we'll get started.</p><p>Father, we thank you. We love you. We desire to worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth. We pray, Father God, that you would search us, know us, see if there's any hurtful ways in us. Lord, we know that we have a lot of brothers and sisters Lord, we know that we have a lot of brothers and sisters with many struggles, parents, and family members who are sick and in need of much prayer.</p><p>We ask, Lord God, that you would guide us and lead us that as a community, that as we grow in number, that it would not simply be in number, but our love for you, our passion, our love for one another would grow along, Lord God, with what you are doing.</p><p>I pray that you would help us that even in this giving, that we would give in a manner that honors you, that glorifies you, and that the offering that we give will be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

Sorry, Luke chapter 19. We're going to be reading from verse 28 all the way down to verse 44. As we kick off our Passion Week with the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Again, Luke chapter 19, verse 28. "After he had said these things, he was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem, when he approached Bethphage and Bethany near the mount that is called Oliveth.</p><p>He sent two of his disciples, saying, 'Go into the village ahead of you. There, as you enter, you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.' So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.</p><p>As they were untying the colt, its owner said to them, 'Why are you untying the colt?' They said, 'The Lord has need of it.' They brought it to Jesus and threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it. As he was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.</p><p>As soon as he was approaching near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen, shouting, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.' Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, rebuke your disciples.' But Jesus answered, 'I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out.' When he approached Jerusalem, he saw the city and wept over it, saying, 'If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, but now they have been hidden from your eyes.</p><p>For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you and surround you and hem you in on every side. And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.'" Let's pray.</p><p>Father, we ask for insight, understanding, conviction, and sanctification, Lord God, through this text. Help us to understand your heart and not just the words. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. As you already know, today is called Palm Sunday because this is the day where Jesus deliberately rides on the donkey, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah was going to come in riding on this donkey and to make a public declaration of who he is.</p><p>Up to this point, there's been a lot of discussion, is he or is he not? Although Jesus has already made it clear, by riding on this donkey, people knew that this was a fulfillment of the prophecy. So he was publicly declaring that if there was any guess, if there was any question who he was, Jesus was identifying who he is.</p><p>Right before he enters, a few days before, Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. And this was a very public miracle. And so word has already spread. So people have already gathered in Jerusalem thinking that maybe they're going to get a glimpse of this Messiah. Maybe they can meet him.</p><p>But after the resurrection of, or the raising of Lazarus, there was no question. If anybody had any doubt, who else could raise somebody from the dead but the Messiah? And so the crowd, it says, in the different passages, says that it was a very large crowd. It was an unusually large crowd.</p><p>Because it's Passover, it was a gathering of all the faithful Jews in that area. And already every Passover during that week would have been filled. But because of expectation of the Messiah possibly coming into Jerusalem, you can imagine that crowd was not a normal crowd. It was some measured as high as possibly over a million people in Jerusalem.</p><p>And it's in that context Jesus comes in making a public declaration. And so each week, each day this week, we're going to go over what Jesus did on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So by the time we come to the resurrection Sunday next Sunday, that we would have had a whole week of preparing our heart for what that resurrection means to us.</p><p>And hopefully that it will have the effect that we're hoping that it will have on every single one of us, that we would renew our devotion and recognize the importance of this day. In Deuteronomy 8, 11-14, the question some people, if you haven't participated in it before, may be asking, "We know the resurrection Sunday is important, but why this big of a deal?" Every single day, this is the busiest week.</p><p>For us at our church, more than Christmas, this resurrection Sunday is the busiest week. We will be here every single day this week. And we're going to go over the text, and we're going to have different people giving testimonies. But the reason why we need to do this, we feel that this is beneficial for us, is the same reason why God gave the Israelites so many festivals.</p><p>They probably have more festivals than any other culture that we know. Almost every month, there's some sort of a holiday on their calendar. And all their calendars point to something that God has done so that they do not forget. In Deuteronomy 8, 11-14, it says, "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments." So I want you to remember that.</p><p>To not to forget. Because there was a constant concern that they were going to forget. That you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes, which I am commanding you today. Because there is a tendency for every single one of us, after a while, after the honeymoon stage of your walk with God, that we get into this pattern of being churched.</p><p>And instead of really giving worship that God deserves, we just put in our time. We do what you're supposed to do because it's Sundays, because it's tradition, because of habit. It says, "So you do not forget the commandments." Verse 12, "Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied and have built good houses and lived in them, and when your herds and your flocks multiplied and your silver and gold multiplied and all that you have multiplies, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery." So there's two things that he says that he's concerned about.</p><p>One is that we forget. And when we forget, what naturally happens is we become proud. And this is a pattern that every single Christian struggles with. Once Christianity becomes a habit in our lives, it becomes a tradition, and there's no fire underneath us. There's no emergency. We have a tendency to cling to God when somebody is sick and when there's an emergency or something happens where we are desperate and something in our lives reminds us how desperate we are for God.</p><p>But when that's not taking place, our bills are paid, we are in somewhat good health, and our jobs are secure, our children are taken care of, our natural tendency is to drift, and we become proud. And when we become proud, you don't have to stick your neck out and say, "I am the best to be proud." You don't necessarily feel the need for Christ.</p><p>You want Christ, but you don't feel the need for Christ. And there's a huge difference between somebody who's praying because he needs Christ versus somebody who's praying because he desires Christ. It may sound like semantics, but there's a world of difference, of a prayer of desperation. And I think if you've ever prayed in desperation, you know the difference.</p><p>Scripture tells us that God has placed all these things in the Jewish calendar so they do not forget, so that they will not become proud because God has blessed them. The text that we're looking at, Jesus comes in riding on the donkey, fulfilling the prophecy, and it says, "Jesus wept." Can you imagine the excitement of Palm Sunday?</p><p>I don't think there was a million people waiting for him as he was riding on this donkey, but can you imagine the large crowd, even 1,000, even 10,000, screaming out, "Hosanna, Hosanna," waving palm branches. Usually that's what they did when their army would go out and come back in victory and celebration.</p><p>So much like if you see old footages of people coming back from war in World War II and they would have confetti falling from the skyscrapers. That's the scene, that in the middle of this huge parade with expectation, jubilation, it says that when Jesus came in, he wept. Now, it doesn't tell us that the disciples saw him weeping and they asked him, "What are you doing?</p><p>Why are you weeping? We're all celebrating." The disciples were confused. Even though Jesus said that he was going to go to the cross, they didn't hear him, they didn't understand him, so they just went through one ear and out the other. I think in the same way they saw Jesus weeping, they couldn't understand why he was weeping.</p><p>It wasn't until afterwards, after the resurrection, after the blinders came off, they remembered, "Yes, Jesus wept." Now I understand why he wept. Why did Jesus weep? In the middle of thousands, hundreds of thousands, calling out his name. Well, there's two instances in the Bible where it tells us where Jesus wept.</p><p>The first instance is in John 11, 35, when Jesus is standing at Lazarus' tomb and in compassion with all the other people weeping in sadness over Lazarus, it says that Jesus wept. But the word that is used for "wept" in that passage is very different than the word that is used here.</p><p>That word there is "dacru," and even though it is translated "wept," the word closely is tied to somebody who is in tears. Not loud weeping, not wailing, just sadness. Now, again, that's another good question. Why was he even sad? Why was he even in tears when he deliberately waited to get to Lazarus?</p><p>And I've mentioned this before in another sermon, and I believe the reason why he was in tears is because the sadness of mankind's judgment. And he was sad, and even though he knew that Lazarus was going to come back from the dead, he did all of that so that he would show his power, and yet it says Jesus cried.</p><p>That would be a closer translation. But in this text, the word for "wept" is "closet," and it is closer to the English translation "wept." It means loud mourning. He was uncontrollable. So in the context, the contrast between the crowds who are yelling out his name versus Jesus wailing and crying out, and he says, "Because you did not recognize the day of visitation." And the explanation that is given to us in this text is that they did not recognize what would bring peace in verse 42.</p><p>"If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, but now they have been hidden from your eyes." They have been hidden from your eyes. Jesus wept because of the judgment that was going to come, because of what was about to happen, and he knew that they were going to betray him, that they were going to turn him in, and he was going to be crucified, because the peace that they wanted him to bring, and once they realized that the peace that they wanted, he wasn't going to bring, that they were going to turn on him.</p><p>And he said this was not just any ordinary judgment. He said when the judgment comes that they're going to tear apart a temple, that not even one stone is going to be left alone. Now that was not an exaggeration, because in AD 70, that's exactly what happens. The Jews finally said, you know what, if the Messiah's not going to deliver us, we're going to gather our army, and we're going to give it our all.</p><p>May the Lord bless us, and they went at it with the Romans, and obviously they couldn't conquer them, and the Romans came in, and the fire that they lit into this temple was so strong that the gold in this temple started melting underneath the stones. So the soldiers who wanted to get to this gold took up every single stone in this temple, hoping that they would be able to find gold, and by doing so fulfilled literally what Jesus said.</p><p>Not a single stone would be left behind, and it would be overturned, and the reason why is because you did not recognize what would bring true peace. Now, their desire for peace. Humanly speaking, we can understand why, because if you look at the prophecies in the Old Testament, almost every prophecy in the Old Testament promises some level of peace.</p><p>In Isaiah 11 and 1 through 2, it says, "Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, "and a branch from his roots will bear fruit. "The spirit of the Lord will rest upon him, "the spirit of wisdom and understanding, "the spirit of counsel and strength, "the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord." Again, a detailed explanation of what the Messiah is going to look like.</p><p>And then he says, "And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, "and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, "and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, "and a little boy will lead them." In other words, this is a picture of terror, turmoil that sin has brought in is going to be restored.</p><p>In Isaiah 11 and 8, "The nursing child will play by the hold of the cobra, "and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den." I could sit here and go through passage after passage of promise of peace that the Messiah is going to bring. And it was not a localized peace.</p><p>If you read the text carefully, it says it's going to be worldwide peace, that the Messiah is going to take away all the wars, all the turmoil, the strife between husband and wife, with parents and their children, a society that is broken apart. We look at our society today, and if I asked you what's the problem of our generation, every single one of you will have a list of things that you think has gone wrong, whether it's political, economical, relational, familial, educational, whatever it may be, every single one of us are very aware that something has gone wrong.</p><p>And we have our own thoughts on how this needs to be restored. And the Jews were no different. But the difference between the Jews and our modern-day people is that the Jews, their whole answer was the Messiah. When he comes, when the righteous Messiah comes, filled with the Holy Spirit, with the power of God behind him, peace is finally going to come.</p><p>You know, what's interesting is the word "Jerusalem" literally means "city of peace." He embedded that. It's embedded into their psyche. It's embedded into everything that they believed--peace. When the Messiah comes, he's going to finally bring peace. Well, if the central thing about Jesus and what he did on the cross was to bring about peace, and the reason why judgment came upon Israel was because they did not see peace, shouldn't we understand what that peace is?</p><p>Shouldn't we make sure that we're not like the Jews, that our idea of peace is biblical, that what we're considering, what we're hoping for, how we think what has gone wrong is going to get fixed, that we're not like the Jews of that time, hoping that if we are faithful, if we do the right thing, that somehow peace is going to come into our life?</p><p>Well, Webster's Dictionary describes peace as a state of tranquility and quietness. There's no turmoil. Second, freedom from civil disturbance to bring peace. That's why we call police officers "peace officers." Or harmony in personal relationships. Maybe it's not societal. Maybe it's a lot more personal because we're having problems within our own family and relationships.</p><p>But again, those are things that the world sees. That's what peace means. Now, the biblical definition of peace isn't devoid of that, but it's much more than that. In fact, to the Jews, peace was everything, and that's why it's in their greeting. Shalom, peace, right? Peace. You know, in our culture, we say hello, but beyond the hello, right?</p><p>In America, what do we say? Bless you, right? Bless you. God bless you. Because we're singing for the Lord's blessing. In the Jewish culture, everything was about shalom. In fact, in the Tanchuma Shoftim, I'm butchering the pronunciation, right? It was basically the Jewish version of their constitution. It was their teaching of how their society should be ruled by God's law.</p><p>And in their teaching, it says all that is written in the Torah was written for the sake of peace. In other words, in this constitution, their central point of their constitution, it states in summary that everything that we do is for the purpose of peace. Why we disorganize a certain way, why we keep the law, why we punish evil, why the family structure, why the temple.</p><p>It said everything that was given to the Jewish nation, the central purpose is to bring peace. That's why they would greet each other shalom. The root word for the Hebrew word for shalom comes from the word shaleim, which means completion. To be complete. Perfection. Restoration of what had been intended.</p><p>So peace isn't simply not having trouble. Peace isn't simply not fighting. The Jewish understanding of the word shalom is to be restored. To be made complete. So the idea of shalom is directly connected to the sabbath. Because the word sabbath, we know that it means rest. But rest isn't simply because we are fatigued and that we need to be restored so that we can go back to work on Monday.</p><p>That's typically how we think of sabbath. We worked hard for five, six days, and so we need to take a break so that we can start over on Monday. But the idea of sabbath comes all the way from the creation when God created the world in six days and then it says on the seventh day he rested.</p><p>So did God rest because he was tired and he needed to be restored so that he can go back and create more things on Monday? No. It means that what he had intended to create, it is done, it is complete. So his sabbath was complete. And he brought the rest of creation, including mankind, into that sabbath.</p><p>But the problem is when man sinned, that sabbath was broken. What was complete and whole was broken. And that's why the whole purpose of salvation is to restore us back into that sabbath. To bring us back into the seventh day where the work is complete, where rest and wholeness is restored.</p><p>So the idea of shalom is directly connected to the teaching of the sabbath in the Bible. To bring us back to what God had intended. So whenever they said shalom, the understanding was may rest come upon you. May the sabbath be restored. The very last word, as Jesus was hanging on the cross, remember what he said?</p><p>It is what? Finished. It is finished. It is complete. Meaning that everything that they've been waiting for, everything that they desired, the completion, the peace that he brought, he says it is finished. It is complete. It is restored. It's not simply that the crucifixion is done but he's at the end of his life.</p><p>He said everything that was needed to restore the sabbath is complete. In other words, shalom has come. The English equivalent to this word completion in the Bible in the Greek is teleos, which means to be complete. And so wherever this word teleos is written in the New Testament, it is translated complete.</p><p>The completion. In 1 Corinthians 13.10, it says when the complete comes, when the perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away. So the word complete is also translated perfect. When the perfect is restored, what God had intended is restored, all the things that are imperfect will go away. Isaiah 54.10, God's covenant with Israel is called the covenant of peace, covenant of shalom.</p><p>Preaching of the gospel is described as preaching peace to those who are near, to those who are far. So the gospel is called the gospel of peace. Romans 5.1 is described, our salvation is described as having peace with God, to be complete. And then finally, Jesus himself is described in Isaiah 9.6 as the prince of peace.</p><p>So this concept of shalom is central to our understanding of our salvation. If we miss this, you have not simply missed a portion of our salvation. You will come to church looking for peace, and you will not find peace. If you don't find peace, it's time for you to move on.</p><p>Sometimes you'll move on from church to church. Then after a while, when that gets exhausted, then you will move on from your faith itself. I don't know how many people in our generation has moved online. Because I haven't rejected Christ, but I've rejected the church. Because I couldn't find peace there.</p><p>So I want Jesus, but all that's attached to Jesus, I've been too disappointed. I don't want any part of that. So they've moved on. In their hearts, they haven't moved on from Christ. They're still holding on. But the fear is that people who have rejected the church, thinking that they haven't rejected Christ, the church is the body of Christ.</p><p>You cannot reject the body and say, "I'm still committed to the head." You cannot do one without the other. In John 1:5, it says, "The light shines in darkness, but the darkness has not understood it." It did not comprehend it. That's exactly why Jesus was weeping. He came to bring peace, to fulfill everything that God had promised.</p><p>And yet they're looking at him, and Jesus knew. Jesus knew what was in their heart. Even before he walked into Jerusalem, the scripture tells us that he would not give himself to the multitudes, because he knew what? He knew what was in their heart. John chapter 6, after he feeds the 5,000, they're chasing after him.</p><p>Thousands of people. I mean, they just would not leave him alone. And they wanted to forcefully make him king, but they find him on the other side of the Sea of Galilee and said, "Lord, why did you leave us?" And Jesus, confronting them, he says, "You did not come to me because you know who I am.</p><p>You came to me because you ate, and you want more. You don't know who I am. You don't know why I came. You just think that if you follow me, you're going to be fed, that you're going to be healed." He says, "I am the bread. I did not just come to give you bread.</p><p>I am the bread. I didn't just come to quench your thirst. I am the living water." Now, I know you've heard this before. You can hear the truth over and over, year after year after year. But when you have committed yourself to a paradigm, and I need this, I want this, even when you hear the truth, it goes into the wrong bucket.</p><p>Just like when Jesus said, "I'm going to the cross. I'm going to the cross. I'm going to the cross. They're going to crucify me." He said, "Well, who's going to be glorified the most when you come?" They were in the physical presence of Christ, heard the audible voice of the Son of God, and they did not understand.</p><p>You can come to church all your life thinking that somehow you are fulfilling and pursuing Christ when you are not because you did not understand what he came to bring. The Sadducees, they thought that since they can't, and they've already given hope. For hundreds of years, the Jews were suppressed by one pagan nation after another, now the Romans.</p><p>So they've given up on any kind of spiritual intervention. They've given up on the resurrection. They've given up on miracles. They've given up on angels. So the Sadducees, who were the senators, they were the ones who were in power of this time. The leaders of Israel basically have given up on God, but they're still committed to their nation.</p><p>So the way that they sought peace was assimilation. If you can't win them, join them. So they decided to adopt the things of the Romans, to submit to them, do whatever they asked, and in return, they will be favored. So the Sadducees were the ones that were favored by the Roman government because they submitted to the law.</p><p>They did everything that they told them to do. So they were the senators. They were the ones who were overseeing the temple, even though they have given up on God. So the way that they were going to seek peace is by assimilating to the world. Do we have that today in our culture?</p><p>Absolutely. More and more churches today are seeking peace by trying to find peace with the world. We're not going to go against that. What point is that? We're not going to anger them. So we're going to preach a gospel with no teeth. We're going to preach a gospel with no judgment.</p><p>So the Christianity that they are propagating has nothing to do with the gospel of the Bible. It's just the promise of hope, peace, love. And who doesn't want that? Whether that comes out of the mouth of Buddha, whether that comes out of the mouth of Muhammad, who's going to reject that gospel?</p><p>So we have a generation of people, just like the Sadducees, who have committed that if they assimilate, if they have peace, the ones who are suppressing us, that we will somehow benefit. That's how the Sadducees decided that they were going to find peace. And then we had the Zealots.</p><p>Zealots were the other end. We cannot accept this. We cannot accept these Sadducees who've given up on God, who compromises these pagans. So they decided that they're going to carry a sword. And every opportunity they get, they're going to match power with power on the other end. And so they had every opportunity.</p><p>They were the ones who were gathering. They're going to put fear into their nation. They're not going to be able to fight them from army to army. So they're going to become the terrorists. They're going to terrorize the Romans. Their idea of peace was going to come by force, if not by army to army, by guerrilla warfare.</p><p>Those were the Zealots. But at the core of why they did that was because they thought that that was going to bring peace. And then you had the Essenes, who just packed up their bags. And they went out to the wilderness, lived in caves, see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.</p><p>If we don't see, if we don't engage, if we just leave them alone, then we're going to find tranquility out in the desert, in the cave. So their idea of peace is as long as no one is fighting, as long as we don't have to hear them, we don't have to see them, that we're okay.</p><p>Even if everything else in the world is falling apart, we're just going to be in the cave, we're just going to live our own life. The core of why they did that is they were also seeking peace. But the greatest tragedy were the Pharisees. Because the Pharisees decided that the only way that they're going to have peace is to get God's blessing.</p><p>And the word "Pharisee" itself basically means to be set apart. It means to be holy. We're going to find peace by being holy. Because our ancestors, they lost peace because they would not keep the law. They were taken into captivity because they wouldn't keep the Sabbath. So they were the ones who were committed, religiously, to receive God's blessing by their work.</p><p>So nobody worked harder than them. Nobody prayed more than they did. Nobody gave more than they did. Nobody sacrificed more than they did. Nobody proselytized more than these guys. They kept the Sabbath so meticulously, and that's why they kept on having problems with Jesus. Because the Sabbath tradition that they created, and they kept on adding to the law, because you have to keep the Sabbath if God's going to bless us.</p><p>If peace is going to return back into Israel, we have to keep the law. And at the center of this law was the Sabbath. So if we want to keep the Sabbath law meticulously, they kept on defining, well, what does it mean to them? What does it mean to work?</p><p>Is this breaking the Sabbath? What if we go this far? Is it breaking the Sabbath? What if we touch a rope? What if we put it down? What if we milk a cow? What if we drink the milk that came from a cow? And so they had all these rules.</p><p>Because they thought that if they kept that, the peace and Sabbath was going to come. Jesus says in the context, because they kept on saying, "You are a Sabbath breaker, and we can't allow you to continue to grow because you keep breaking our tradition." Not the Sabbath of the Bible, but our tradition.</p><p>And Jesus says in Mark 2, 27-28, Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." In other words, you Pharisees completely missed the whole point. You're trying so hard to get the Lord's blessing by keeping the law, but you completely missed the whole point of the Sabbath.</p><p>He said the Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath. Now, think about that. Again, Sadducees are the liberals. That's not where you and I are. And then the Zealots. Zealots are the ones who are going to militantly, we're going to, by force, take over. For the most part, that's not us.</p><p>We're not the Esses, because we're in the thick of things. We didn't pack up our bags and move to some island. So we're not the Esses. But if we're not careful, we can be just like the Pharisees. That we can become very religious and do the right things for the wrong reason and completely miss Christ.</p><p>And at the core of it is because we want peace. We want peace. So if you're a Pharisee, in this kind of context, you can't tell. We're just good Christians. If you're a Pharisee in a church like ours, you can't tell the difference. You say, "Oh, he's a legalist." You can't tell by the action itself, because we're doing the right thing.</p><p>You can't tell, it's like, "Oh, you're a Pharisee "because you think somehow that's going to lead to salvation." You don't know what they're thinking. The Pharisees, we wouldn't have known. I mean, should you have kept the Sabbath? Yes. Should you have proselytized? Yes. Did God call them to give?</p><p>Yes. Did God tell them to study the law, debate over what it means to be experts of the law? All of that was commanded by God. You couldn't tell that they were Pharisees simply by what they were doing externally. It's because God was able to see beyond that. They were doing the right things for the wrong reason.</p><p>And we can easily fall into that, where we're seeking peace through the law. Where you come to church, and the church doesn't bring you peace. Initially, it was like, "Man, I found a community "where we can be one another, and we're so encouraging." But as soon as that gets broken, "Oh, I'm not going to find peace here." Hebrews 10.29 says, "How much severe punishment "do you think he will deserve, "who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, "and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant "by which he was sanctified, "and has insulted the spirit of grace?" The whole book of Hebrews was written for people who forgot.</p><p>It may be in danger of becoming proud. And as a result, the way it's described, how much severe a punishment would there be for those who trample underfoot the Son of God, which is sacred, which is at the core, and you move beyond. You know how that happens? You know how we end up trampling what is sacred?</p><p>In Hebrews 2.3 it says, "How will we escape "if we neglect so great a salvation?" Simply by neglect. We don't take the cross and trample it on the ground. We don't spit on it. We don't teach heresy. It just happens when it's no longer sacred. It becomes a habit, just something that we do.</p><p>And after a while, we feel when we've done well, God needs to answer my prayers. He needs to make things right. And then when I've done, I've sacrificed, and God doesn't give me what I desire, I didn't get the peace that I wanted. I didn't get the rest that I wanted.</p><p>Simply by neglect. I know some of you come from broken homes. And as a result from coming from broken homes, you think that if you get married, find a good wife, good husband, that what was broken will be restored. So many people come into a marriage thinking that they're going to find shalom in their home.</p><p>And when they don't find it, all kinds of turmoil break out. Because your wife and your husband isn't bringing you peace. Some of you grew up in immigrant homes where the parents tried so hard to make money. They had a hard time paying bills. They were young. He said, "When I get older, "I'm going to make sure that my children "don't go through what I went through." So in your heart, you think that whatever turmoil that you may have experienced when you were a child, that if you had enough money, that you will find your shalom.</p><p>So you're chasing money. Even though you're worshiping God on Sunday, but Monday through Saturday, you are consumed with making money. You're trying to get things in order so that my children don't go through what I went through. And so you're trying to find shalom through your hard work, through right decisions, right investments.</p><p>And as time goes by, you realize that that shalom is elusive. Some of you came from abuse. You know, it's no longer shocking to me. It was shocking early on in ministry how many of our sisters have been abused. According to statistics, it's one in four, and I think that's larger than that now, at least from experience.</p><p>And it's no longer just women. I don't know how many instances, men and women, but particularly our sisters, who have been abused when they were young. And as a result of that, they feel like, "I lost my peace." And you're jumping from relationship to relationship to situation to situation, hoping to find some rest, and you don't find it.</p><p>It's been five years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, and it's not coming. And now you are maybe beginning to lose hope. Where is this shalom? Why is this not coming? Even after all these years, why is this not coming? Maybe God is not real. Maybe God doesn't care.</p><p>Some of you have been hurt by people, have been betrayed, maybe in the church, maybe by the leadership. And so you're having a hard time. I love Christ, but I don't love the church. And so you're at that. You're acquaintances with everybody, but you're stiff-arming everybody because you don't want to get hurt again because your shalom was broken, or at least so you think.</p><p>Every single one of us, in some sense, is seeking to have the Sabbath restored because that's what was lost when man fell at peace. Whatever you call it, there's something inside of us that is desiring desperately for peace. And then when you get older, you realize and you get disappointed.</p><p>Maybe this isn't it. Maybe that isn't it. And then now we look forward to retirement. Maybe if I just disengage, maybe if I don't have to work, maybe if I don't have responsibility, maybe if I don't have to deal with people, and I can finally retire, then I'm going to find my shalom.</p><p>It is no different because that's what the Jews wanted. That's what they thought that Jesus was going to bring. And when they were shaking their palm branches and saying, "Hosanna, hosanna," they were waiting for that shalom to be restored. And Jesus weeps. If only you knew. If only you knew what would bring that Sabbath.</p><p>Christ came to bring that Sabbath back. Christ and Christ alone. Not the leaders. Not your husband. Not your wife. Not your job. Not your retirement. Not physical rest. Not an organization. Christ and Christ alone. You can come to church all your life and never, your love for Christ never grows any deeper because you're seeking for shalom in the church.</p><p>You're seeking for shalom in your vacations, in your time off. The reason why this week is so important is to recalibrate our thoughts, our heart, so we do not forget. We do not forget and we do not become proud so we do not simply drift into the current of this world.</p><p>Christ and Christ alone is our shalom. And I pray that every event that we do, we participate in this week, will remind us of that and that next week when we come back together on Sunday, that we would all be able to celebrate the shalom of Christ. Let's pray.</p><p>Father, as we kick off this Passion Week, help us, Lord God, as a church, wherever we are now, whether we have been striving and want to get deeper with you, whether we have been drifting and need to be recalled back into your presence, I pray that you would help us that every part of this week would soften our hearts, break our pride, that we would not simply say that we have been crucified with Christ with words, with empty theology, but that all this ambition and hope that we have placed on wrong things would be laid at the cross, that we would be able to recognize the shalom of Christ.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Let's all stand up for the closing praise. We'll sing "When Peace Like a River." When peace like a river attended my way, When sorrows like sea billows rolled, Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul.</p><p>It is well, it is well with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul. Though Satan should buffet, Though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control That Christ has regarded my helpless estate And has shed His own blood for my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul.</p><p>It is well, it is well with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul. My sin, O the bliss! My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought! My sin, not in part, but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.</p><p>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! It is well, it is well with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul. And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sighed, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll, The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend.</p><p>Even so, it is well with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul. Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and the deep, deep love of God the Father, rest, restore, encourage, challenge, and strengthen us and sanctify us, that we may declare the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that more and more eyes of the people in our generation will be opened, will be delivered from the power of our enemy, that they also may come to worship our only God, in spirit and in truth.</p><p>Lead us, guide us, restore us this week, as we remember the suffering of Christ. Amen. God sent His Son, then called Him Jesus. He came to love, heal, and forgive. He lived and died to buy my pardon. An empty grave is there to put my Savior last. Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.</p><p>Because He lives, all fear is gone. Because I know He holds the future. And life is worth the living just because He lives. Because I know He holds the future. And life is worth the living just because He lives. Because I know He holds the future. And life is worth the living just because He lives.</p><p>Because I know He holds the future. Who breaks the power of sin and darkness? Whose love is mighty and so much stronger? The King of glory, the King above all kings. Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder? The King of glory, the King above all kings.</p><p>This is amazing grace. This is unfailing love. That You would take my place. That You would bear my cross. You laid down Your life. That I would be set free. Jesus, I sing for all that You've done for me. Who brings our chaos back into order? Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?</p><p>The King of glory, the King of glory. Who rules the nations with truth and justice? Shines like the sun in all of His brilliance. The King of glory, the King above all kings. This is amazing grace. This is unfailing love. That You would take my place. That You would bear my cross.</p><p>You laid down Your life. That I would be set free. Jesus, I sing for all that You've done for me. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Worthy is the King who conquered the grave. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.</p><p>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.</p></div></body></html>
