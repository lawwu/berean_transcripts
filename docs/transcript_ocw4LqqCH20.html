Let me get to a few announcements before we get started. First of all, as you know, we have a members meeting that's going on after this service at 2 PM. So if you're a member or you're being introduced as a member, please stick around at 2 PM.</p><p>And along with that, so that you don't need to go out and have lunch and then come back, our Taiwan mission team is having a lunch fundraiser. So you probably saw as you were coming in, they're serving lunch out there. And so please stop by there. And the lunch is $10, and then the milk tea is $5.</p><p>So $10 for adults and $5 for children, and then $5 for the winter melon milk tea. Okay, so please visit that afterwards. And then, again, right at 2 o'clock sharp, we're going to be starting our members meeting. It's going to be a pretty packed room, so please try to come and fill every seat in the front.</p><p>And we're going to have to put white chairs in here, so please try to fill as much as you can. Evangelism Outing, our outreach team is having an Evangelism Outing that's happening at 1 PM this coming Saturday. Okay, yeah, this Saturday at 1 PM. So our outreach team has been very busy doing, you know, gospel night.</p><p>They have a seeker group that's happening on Wednesday nights. And then monthly, they go out to Irvine Spectrum and OC Source Mall. And so if you want to come and just learn how to evangelize or just kind of be there to see how people who are out and sharing the gospel with people.</p><p>And so if you want to just partner with somebody who's more of a veteran doing that, you're more than welcome to come and join them. That's happening on Saturdays once a month, but the next one's coming up this Saturday. Next Sunday is Communion Sunday, so please come prepared for that, for all three services.</p><p>Also, next Sunday at 1.30, after this service, at 1.30, there's going to be a SEEDS parents meeting. So if you have a child in the SEEDS department, this is an annual meeting where they'll present the material that they're covering, the teachers that are teaching, and what they're doing, what their philosophy is, and what they're trying to do in the SEEDS ministry.</p><p>So if you have a child in that ministry, please come to that meeting at 1.30. Grab your lunch, do what you need to do, and at 1.30, the meeting's going to be happening in this room. And then Cleaning and Maintenance Day on August 10th at 9 a.m. Not this Saturday, but Saturday after that at 9 a.m.</p><p>So if you come, just show up at 9 a.m. The people who are in charge of this will give you what you need, and they'll kind of direct you, saying that we need this or that. And one last thing is, it's not on the thing, but if you haven't signed up for the Bible study home group or small group, please do so as soon as we can because, again, we're starting to put people in small groups and home groups already.</p><p>All right, so let me pray for us. And again, a physical offering box is in the back, so let me pray for you. Pray for us, and then we'll give you a minute to give your offering. And then again, the box is in the back, so let's pray. Father, we thank you so much for the goodness and the grace that you give us day to day, things that we are aware of and things that are happening behind the scenes, Lord God.</p><p>We pray that whatever it is that we have been entangled with before we came, help us to fix our eyes completely upon Christ, and that what we give to you will be an overflow of your abundant grace. I pray that even in this giving, that it would be an expression of our worship to you in spirit and in truth, and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Church family, let's stand together. Why don't we take a minute to say hello to maybe those new around you. Introduce yourself. Say hi. Great is your faithfulness. Great is your faithfulness, O God. You wrestle with a sinner's heart. You lead us by still waters into mercy.</p><p>And nothing can keep us apart. So remember. So remember your people. Remember your children. Remember your promise, O God. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough for me. Great is your love and justice, God. You use the weak to lead the strong. You lead us in the song of your salvation.</p><p>And all your people sing along the song. So remember your people. Remember your children. Remember your promise, O God. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough for me. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough for me. So remember me.</p><p>So remember your people. Remember your children. Remember your promise, O God. One more time. So remember your people. Remember your children. Remember your promise, O God. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough. Your grace is enough for me. Your grace is enough. Heaven reaching down to us. Your grace is enough for me.</p><p>God, I'm singing. Your grace is enough. I'm covered in your love. Your grace is enough for me. Be Thou my vision. O Lord of my heart. And not be all else to me. Save that Thou art. And Thou my best Thou art. By day or by night. Waking or sleeping.</p><p>Thy presence my light. Be Thou my wisdom. And Thou my true word. I ever with Thee. And Thou with me, Lord. Thou my great Father. And I Thy true soul. Thou in me dwelling. And I with Thee, Lord. Riches I heed not. Nor man's empty praise. Thou mine inheritance.</p><p>Now and always. Thou and Thou only. First in my heart. Thine King of heaven. My treasure Thou art. My King of heaven. My victory won. May I reach heaven's joys. Thou my heaven's son. Heart of my own heart. Whatever befall. Still be my vision. O ruler of my heart.</p><p>My King of heaven. My victory won. May I reach heaven's joys. Thou my heaven's son.

He breaks the power of cancelled sleep. He sets the prisoner free.</p><p>His blood can make the foulest flee. His blood availed for me. He speaks in listening to his voice. The mournful broken hearts rejoice. The humble poor believe. Glory to God and praise and love. Be ever, ever his. Peace below and saints above. The church in earth and heaven o'er.</p><p>For a thousand tongues to sing. My great Redeemer's praise. The glories of my God and King. The triumphs of his grace. Let's pray. Now may the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face shine upon you. And be gracious to you. May the Lord turn his face towards you.</p><p>And give you peace. Send us, Lord, that we may be the aroma of Christ. That the world may know that you sent your only begotten Son. That there is hope in the name of Jesus. That you would allow us and equip us and strengthen us. That we may be your ambassadors wherever you send us this week.</p><p>May glory and honor and praise and worship and adoration. Belong to you and to you alone. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. God sent his Son. They called him Jesus. He came to the world. He'll end for good. He lived and died to buy my poverty. An empty grave is there to my Savior lay.</p><p>Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Because he lives, all fear is gone. Because I know he holds the future. And life is worth the living just because he lives.</p></div></body></html>
