that is not to conform to this world but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=61s">00:01:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be transformed by the

verse 8 basically is an application that specifically we are told to transform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=77s">00:01:17.460</a></span> |

href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=86s">00:01:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this morning we're going to look at three separate principles that we see about sanctification</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=91s">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in application within the context of the body of

whole summary of what we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=99s">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=100s">00:01:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to tell it to you now and then I'm going to repeat it later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=103s">00:01:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you happen to fall asleep in the middle, at least get the beginning and get the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=107s">00:01:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=108s">00:01:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to tell you ahead of time.</span></div><div

it happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=117s">00:01:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when we confront the glory of God and we are humbled and it leads us to repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=124s">00:02:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Repentance is the key to our salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=127s">00:02:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ offered himself as a living sacrifice for us and he took on our sins upon himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=133s">00:02:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we are confronted by the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we can either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=138s">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "I don't believe in that," and walk away from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=140s">00:02:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or when you're confronted by that, it causes you to recognize your own sins and repent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=147s">00:02:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you know, the word repentance, metanoia, literally means to change your mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=152s">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So repentance in justification isn't just, "I did something Tuesday or Thursday or I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=158s">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have this act or a particular aspect of my life I'm repenting."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=164s">00:02:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification happens when you recognize that there is a sin nature in you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=169s">00:02:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That the way you view the world, the way that you view what is right, what is wrong, creation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=175s">00:02:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose, death, life, all of it was tainted by this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=179s">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're confronted by the gospel of Jesus Christ, you repent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=182s">00:03:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Your mind is changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=185s">00:03:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But for some reason, when we come to sanctification, we think, "Well, we've done that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=189s">00:03:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We've humbled ourselves and we've repented."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=191s">00:03:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the rest of it is hard work trying to get closer to God through our works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=198s">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's an aspect of it where it is true, where it does require our labor, it does require</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=202s">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">our commitment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=204s">00:03:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, this is the summary of what we're going to be talking about this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=208s">00:03:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification happens when we humble ourselves before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=214s">00:03:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification begins when we humble ourselves before man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=217s">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me say that again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=220s">00:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification happens when we humble ourselves before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification begins when we humble ourselves before man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=227s">00:03:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it begins with humbling ourselves, and then we continue by humbling ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=234s">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what Paul is saying in verse 3 to verse 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=238s">00:03:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So typically, we can get into this and look at the different gifts and how they all fit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=242s">00:04:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">in together, and we are going to talk some about that, but I want to give you a bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=245s">00:04:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">picture and understand it in the context of how the Jews probably would have heard what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=250s">00:04:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he was saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=252s">00:04:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that we want to look at is sanctification requires thinking soberly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246047958#t=257s">00:04:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of ourselves,
