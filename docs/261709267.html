our college ministry and our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=87s">00:01:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to become very aware of our

living your life, you kind of break up your day into things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=98s">00:01:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you're doing, you're in class now or you're at home now or you're at church now and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=102s">00:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">these kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=104s">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do want us to be very sensitive to the fact that there are people existing in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=110s">00:01:50.120</a></span> | <span

of our own lives, we kind of become very self-centered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=117s">00:01:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and thinking like this is what I'm doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=119s">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people become a program or an agenda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=122s">00:02:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather than that, I hope that our eyes are open to see people where they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=127s">00:02:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone that you see, yes, people outside, but even here in this room, you are destined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=133s">00:02:13.400</a></span> | <span

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=139s">00:02:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that should put an eternal burden on your soul because we're dealing with eternal beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=146s">00:02:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why we're covering this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=149s">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why this was maybe one of the harder studies I've had to do because you know, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=153s">00:02:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was like, "Oh, a seminar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=154s">00:02:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done seminars before."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=155s">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as I was going into it, I was like, "Oh, this is kind of a big topic."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=160s">00:02:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't...man, this was really tough for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=164s">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I stayed up pretty late last night doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=167s">00:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if some things come out a little bit incoherent, please use the question and answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=171s">00:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">time at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=173s">00:02:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Steven has put up on the Facebook page, like a Google form kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=178s">00:02:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can send your questions that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=180s">00:03:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the very end, after I give you guys a little bit of a break, we'll be going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=184s">00:03:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">straight into the

here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=191s">00:03:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But at any point, if you have a question that you feel like, "Oh, this would be better addressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=194s">00:03:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like right now," please raise your hand and just ask it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=198s">00:03:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=199s">00:03:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So just do this and you can ask the question right away too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=201s">00:03:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't mind stopping the teaching for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=216s">00:03:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the very end, if you have further questions, we're going to have the staff kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261709267#t=221s">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of sitting around up front while people are going out and hanging out or going
