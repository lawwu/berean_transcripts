for this time now as we study, God, that you bless us thoroughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=135s">00:02:15.920</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=139s">00:02:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I want to give some introductory remarks about the passage as a whole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=144s">00:02:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember that in context, the Apostle Paul said in chapter 1, verse 12, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=151s">00:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=156s">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=157s">00:02:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember that this letter, it has multiple purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=160s">00:02:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to encourage them, he's praying for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=163s">00:02:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that he wanted to say was, clearly the church was worried about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=169s">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They sent somebody to him, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=172s">00:02:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then, in response, he was giving an update, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=175s">00:02:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how I'm doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=176s">00:02:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And although they might have heard, like, "Oh, goodness, he's, you know, jailed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=180s">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He's under guard," you know, and in his absence are all these other people who are preaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=185s">00:03:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out of false motives or whatnot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=187s">00:03:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He's saying, "These circumstances don't be dismayed," okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=190s">00:03:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because God has turned these circumstances for the good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=194s">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, within this last portion, though, what's very interesting is, given the context, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=200s">00:03:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is talking about finances quite a bit in this section because he is thanking them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=207s">00:03:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He is appreciative of the concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=210s">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's really interesting is he uses what I like to call euphemisms for a hard topic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=215s">00:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a topic pertaining to finances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=217s">00:03:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for a lot of us, actually, talking about finances can get a little touchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=223s">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's sometimes kind of weird, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=225s">00:03:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like majority of us would, I just thought it was kind of funny that it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=229s">00:03:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">last thing, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=230s">00:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, you talk about everything else, "How are you doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=232s">00:03:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything's good?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=233s">00:03:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=234s">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, by the way, you know, he brings it up at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=237s">00:03:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what's really interesting, then, is as he's talking about finances, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=243s">00:04:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in commonality, right, we can have misgivings about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=248s">00:04:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We could be misinterpreting what he's doing with finances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=252s">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And because it can be a touchy subject, essentially, Apostle Paul gives some qualifiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=258s">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice within this text, he talks about the way that they gave, but then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=262s">00:04:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">also talks in more qualifying terms, "Oh, this is what I'm thinking," or "This is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=268s">00:04:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm intending," in terms of those finances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=271s">00:04:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's really interesting is, overall, this passage has so much to say about his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=276s">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thankfulness and so much to say about his contentment in relation to those finances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=283s">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=284s">00:04:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just had a kind of interesting thought, you know, as I mentioned that sometimes finances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=289s">00:04:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is a touchy subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=291s">00:04:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And you kind of wonder, like, "Why is it a touchy subject?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=295s">00:04:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you have to qualify this and that?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=297s">00:04:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=299s">00:04:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because sometimes when something, an object, is very near and dear, if something is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=307s">00:05:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">precious or something is of the object of my desire, then it becomes touchy to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=312s">00:05:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=314s">00:05:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like you don't go and talk to somebody about their kid and just flippantly make comments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=320s">00:05:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and whatever it may be, that can be a very sensitive subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=324s">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you kind of realize, "Oh, man, why is it that sometimes talking about finances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=329s">00:05:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is like talking about someone's baby?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=331s">00:05:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It shouldn't be like that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=332s">00:05:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if we're thinking about it correctly, if we're having the right heart attitude towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=337s">00:05:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">finances, it shouldn't be so touchy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=341s">00:05:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But nevertheless, I think in that whole vein then, in that whole thought, this passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=346s">00:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is a huge encouragement to have a mature attitude in both the receiving, in both the concept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=353s">00:05:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of general finances, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=355s">00:05:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't the only passage in the Bible, obviously, that talks about finances, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=359s">00:05:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">very much appreciate Apostle Paul's mentality towards it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=362s">00:06:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=363s">00:06:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in saying that, you don't have to copy this down, I just wanted to show you how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=368s">00:06:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">saw the breakdown of the passage.</span></div><div

pattern?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/374585270#t=374s">00:06:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you see any structure?</span></div><div
