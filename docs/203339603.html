Matthew chapter 11, chapter 21 that is, verses 42 to 44, Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=79s">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">said to them, "Have you ever read the Scriptures?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=83s">00:01:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost

has become the cornerstone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=90s">00:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This was the Lord's doing, and it is

Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=97s">00:01:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=102s">00:01:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">producing its fruits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=103s">00:01:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=110s">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it will crush him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=112s">00:01:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea here is that Jesus just finished describing a parable to these Pharisees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=118s">00:01:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That the land master had left his workers in the field, and when he sent people to reap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=124s">00:02:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the produce of it, they murdered them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=126s">00:02:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally when he sent his son, they killed him too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=129s">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus asked this question, "What is the landlord going to do?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=133s">00:02:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they themselves say, "Well surely they will be punished."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=137s">00:02:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well that idea of "surely they will be punished" is the same idea that's warning us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=143s">00:02:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If we leave the Gospel message, if we jettison the truth that we say we believe, then God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=149s">00:02:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Himself is going to judge us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=152s">00:02:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that He describes it is the stone that was supposed to be our sanctuary, our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=156s">00:02:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">foundation, now becomes the thing that we break upon, the thing that crushes us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=162s">00:02:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a clear warning for us, that that fork in the road, for one, leads to a path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=168s">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of sanctuary, and the other leads to a path of destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=172s">00:02:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other point that we have to understand, that there's a valuable lesson to learn from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=177s">00:02:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about expectation, how when we're disappointed, then we sometimes change our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=184s">00:03:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=185s">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But many times what we do is when we're disappointed, we actually stop trusting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=191s">00:03:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We stop trusting the people, we stop trusting God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=195s">00:03:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can't be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=197s">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">See for Apostle Peter, he learned a valuable lesson in trusting the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=202s">00:03:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you recall when Jesus Christ was teaching the disciples, when He was telling them, "I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=208s">00:03:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to leave you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=210s">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He was telling them that Christ must suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=212s">00:03:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He was telling them that Christ must go towards this persecution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=216s">00:03:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And Apostle Peter was one of the first ones who said, "You don't have to do that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=221s">00:03:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He was one of the first ones who said, "No, I'll fight for you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=224s">00:03:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually pulled out his sword and said, "I'll even kill for you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=228s">00:03:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when Jesus essentially told him, "You don't know what you're talking about, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=233s">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to get behind me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=234s">00:03:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">See this valuable lesson Apostle Peter had to learn, and we need to learn it as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=240s">00:04:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That just as Christ, the cornerstone, the real cornerstone, experienced first the suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=246s">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">then entered into His glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=249s">00:04:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For us too, we likewise, as living stones, must first go through hardship, and then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=255s">00:04:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">enter into our

suffering?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=261s">00:04:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me ask you, do you expect to have all the results before putting in the work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=268s">00:04:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we expect to have rewards before actually competing or fighting and toiling?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=274s">00:04:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we expect to have victory without there being any battle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=277s">00:04:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think many of us probably, we would like to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=280s">00:04:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We would like to learn the easy way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=283s">00:04:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We would like to have the fruits of sanctification without necessarily going through the process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=289s">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of being purified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=290s">00:04:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But the truth of the matter is, we, just like our Savior, are going to go through the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=296s">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">process and

disciples to follow, we as those who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=309s">00:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ will follow the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=312s">00:05:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of lasting questions I want to ask is as we think about that, the main question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=319s">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for us was, what are our expectations?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=323s">00:05:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What are we looking forward to in saying, "This is what I anticipate for my life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=328s">00:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we so, were so foolish to just think that as long as I'm God, they'll never suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=335s">00:05:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we were so foolish to think as long as I love people and I'm kind to them, then they'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/203339603#t=339s">00:05:39.760</a></span>
