Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Testing, testing. One, two, three. It is just right past seven o'clock. Good to see you. Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. For those of you guys who are by the cafe bar, please make your way on over.</p><p>For those of you who are newcomers, you guys can take a seat on the side. We'll have our worship time first and then join our class for discussion. Okay. Please join with me in a word of prayer as we get ourselves situated for a time of praise. Let's pray together.</p><p>Heavenly Father, we want to, in every situation, give you thanks, Lord God. We are truly grateful that every single day we receive from your gracious hand blessing for each day, mercies anew, and strength. We pray, God, that it would be our faith, our hope in Christ that continues to empower us.</p><p>And, Lord, we know that sweet opportunities like this to sing of your greatness, to learn of your word, that all of this, Lord God, is empowering to our soul. We ask, God, that as we gather each night, the discussion, the learning, that all of this truly would be spiritually fruitful, that it would be engaging both to our minds and also to our souls.</p><p>We want to lift this time up to you, God. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Great is the Lord. Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise. In the city of our God, the holy place, the joy of the whole earth. Great is the Lord and whom we have the victory.</p><p>We bow down on our knees. And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high. And, Lord, we want to thank you for the works you've done in our lives. And, Lord, we trust in your unfailing love. For you alone, our God eternal throughout earth and heaven above. Great is the Lord is the Lord and most worthy of praise.</p><p>In the city of our God, the holy place, the joy of the whole earth. Great is the Lord and we have the victory. Great is the Lord and whom we have the victory. Great is the Lord and whom we have the victory. He aids us against the enemy. And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high.</p><p>And, Lord, we want to thank you for the works you've done in our lives. And, Lord, we trust in your unfailing love. For you alone, our God eternal throughout earth and heaven. And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high.</p><p>And, Lord, we want to thank you for the works you've done in our lives. And, Lord, we trust in your unfailing love. For you alone, our God eternal throughout earth and heaven above. When the music fades, all is stripped away. And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high.</p><p>And, Lord, we want to lift your name on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high.</p><p>And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high. And, Lord, we want to lift your hand on high.</p><p>I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within. Through the way things appear, You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.</p><p>I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. King of endless worth. King of endless worth. No one could express how much you deserve. Though I'm weak and poor. All I have is yours. Every single breath. I'll bring you more than a song.</p><p>For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within. Through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.</p><p>When it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. When it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. When it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. Let's pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, for this opportunity to worship you.</p><p>To sing these praises to you. As we go deeper tonight, more into your covenant. Into the church covenant about Sunday worship. We pray that we would be devoted. We would be committed to attending Sunday worship. But not that our worship would be defined just to Sundays. But would our worship be a lifestyle?</p><p>Every day. In all of our... Every season. All the things that we do. How we spend our time. How we spend our money. We pray that all things would be for you. And for you alone, Lord. So we thank you. We love you. We pray all this in your name.</p><p>Amen. Hey. Well, I do have some important announcements for you guys this evening. This Sunday, we're going to be observing the communion table. So please make sure to take some extra time to pray. Evaluate your own heart. Think about where you are with the Lord. And come prepared to, again, observe that table this Sunday.</p><p>We want to highlight that on October 13th, 2 p.m. We're going to be having our all members meeting. Plus, this one is where we have our service fair. So if you guys haven't been to one of those before, our courtyard will have all the representatives from the various teams that exist at our church.</p><p>And you can both find out just information about what's going on, but also you can look for opportunities to serve at that time. That day, in order to make sure that things are going well and also to fundraise, our youth group will be preparing delicious Mediterranean chicken bowls. It's just $10 per adult, so make sure you guys save your stomachs for that.</p><p>Just a quick note on this. Payment will be through SubSplash. That way we can take card and then the process will be faster. I do want to highlight, just because the registration is closing soon, that there's a women's ministry event on Saturday, October 19th. This is my story. This is my song.</p><p>Make sure you sign up for that this week. Otherwise, the registration will close. Another important announcement is that near the tail end of the year, we do have a lot of children's events, including our Reformation night, etc. Anybody who desires to be safety trained, there's a safety training opportunity happening Sunday, October 20th, which takes place at 1:30 in the main sanctuary.</p><p>Members who would like to volunteer must be safety trained prior to having any official position with the children. So please make sure that you sign up for that. Otherwise, you can also just show up to participate in that. I've got a couple more here. One, there is a family ministry picnic that's taking place October 20th from 11:00 a.m.</p><p>to 3:00 p.m. at Bill Barber Park. Both members and non-members are welcome to come. It'll be a sweet time of fellowship. Mark your calendar for those of you who are in the family ministry and come out. The final thing is, as Thanksgiving is just a few months away, we are taking sign-ups for people who want to simply participate and be placed into a regional home group.</p><p>So there was a table out. Please also check out our app, website, etc. and register to that. That will help us a lot for you guys to register early, because you can imagine trying to get 700-plus people into distinct groups. And then, you know, people coordinating, it's going to be a big bear.</p><p>So please make sure you sign up and register early for the regional Thanksgiving dinner. That will again take place November 24th, Sunday, Sunday evening, okay? All right, those are all the announcements. We'll see you guys back here at 8:00 p.m. sharp for the teaching time. Thank you.

If you guys in the rooms can hear me and make your way out to the main area, I'll give you guys about a minute to get situated and then we'll start the study.</p><p>Hi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, hello, hello. Sorry, I'm just going to grab a napkin real fast.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. Okay. Okay. All righty, you guys. Looks like everybody is out of the rooms. So we will go ahead and let me say a brief word of prayer, and then we'll jump into the study. Father, we ask God that you would grant to us remembrance, conviction, and ongoing sobriety.</p><p>A lot of the things that we learn throughout this series are both good review, things that we have heard before and yet difficult sometimes to apply. God, grant to us perseverance. Grant to us, Lord God, a steady heart that desires to walk after you. We thank you in Christ's name.</p><p>Amen. Okay. So, this evening we are talking about covenant number four, and the covenant reads, I commit to attending Sunday worship at BCC every week to the best of my ability. And so, explaining this is very easy. Don't miss Sunday worship. Good night, everybody. Okay. Right? I mean, in some sense, it could be that easy.</p><p>But just like I prayed just a moment ago, we find actually that life becomes very full. We find that actually other kind of distracting things happen, et cetera, et cetera, and there are many, many reasons by which we could have, I guess you could also just simply call them excuses, where attending Sunday worship can be tough.</p><p>And I do realize, obviously, I am preaching to the choir because the vast majority of you here have already signed off saying, I've already committed to this, that I will be here every Sunday, right? As a part of my commitment to this church, the local body. Okay? But the problem is, there are not only one or two things, but there are a lot of situations and occasions when we say, hey, exception, right?</p><p>I've got family in town I need to take care of. My aging parents are here or there, and all that kind of stuff. And we need guidance and a bit of wisdom as to think about, okay, where do we draw the line with the reasons by which we may not come to church?</p><p>We've also found that we are very privileged, I believe, and through these privileges, there are things we can sometimes over-commit ourselves. Whether it be just you, you may have your dedication to your own extracurricular activities, or it may be just the members of our family, our own children with lots of things they've committed to.</p><p>Everything from Korean class, piano class, Taekwondo class, and more, right? But when we think about this commitment that says, I will commit to attend Sunday worship at Berean every week to the best of my ability, now we've got to ask the question, what does the best of my ability part really mean?</p><p>And I'm going to say this, the best of my ability then means that I am going to make every effort that I can. I will also do due diligence to schedule everything else around Sunday service. Building an expectation in first my own mind, but in all of my children, my friends, my co-workers, and classmates, et cetera, et cetera, that your worship to God is non-negotiable.</p><p>Everybody else works around Sunday worship schedule. That's one way to think about it, isn't it? It's one way to think about it. Now, as we think about, I'm starting off already with an application here, then as we think about this high-level commitment, what we're saying is, by making it a non-negotiable, meaning nothing else, nobody can negotiate with me, my child can't say, oh, pretty, pretty, pretty, please.</p><p>Oh, okay, right? I am placing the worship of God, but more particularly, the gathering of the Christians, as the highest priority in my life, yes? To such a degree that, for example, if we think about the common conflicts that come our way, most of the time, for you guys, it's probably work.</p><p>During COVID time, we actually took a survey of how many of our church people work in the medical field, and we know that your schedules are sometimes very unpredictable. They won't give it to you until a certain point. You don't have that much say, even though you can request.</p><p>Even back at COVID, we had somewhere around 200 people who were working within the medical field, okay? Now, that being the case, the questions aren't going to be, did you make it, you know? Did you make it to Sunday, every single Sunday? But it's that question of, did you make every effort, or did you pre-plan, and did you do diligence to make those requests?</p><p>If you have a business trip, we've said this in our membership class, if you have a business trip to Florida, fly back. I'm just kidding. I was just trying to see if you're paying attention. All right. We've always said, no. The corporate time of worship is so important. You're going to Florida, then you're going to go find Bible Baptist Church of Tallahassee, Florida, and schedule in Sunday worship, and talk to your boss, and say, hey, you know that I love going to church, Sunday morning, 10 to 12, give me two hours.</p><p>I'm going to go take the Uber, come back. We good? So that your boss knows, dang, that's of high priority, right? Likewise, if you have family coming in, the example is, if you have family coming in, your family members should know, dude, if we're going into Irvine with Mark, we're going to his church, right?</p><p>That you invite all of them. You always want to come to church with me? We'll go to, you know, the 11 o'clock service, and then afterwards, I'll take you to Laguna Beach, or whatever it is you're taking them to. But you're setting the agenda because you're doing the due diligence to make sure that's a priority even in their schedule, so your family knows.</p><p>And then, obviously, there are people who take family vacations, et cetera, et cetera. Likewise, the question is, did you schedule into the vacation time? That along the route of wherever you're going to visit, it's like, we're going to go and worship God because it's Sunday morning, and God has called his children to gather and give him praise to such a degree, right?</p><p>And maybe you might say, oh, but if we're here at this time, I'd even posit the thought, if majority of the trips, because the weekend you take from Friday to Sunday, the other option is to take it Thursday to Saturday. But that costs more. Totally. You'll have to eat the extra cost, but your soul will be fed on Sunday.</p><p>Your commitments will be upheld, and your priority structure and the value system in your life will be consistent, right? It's a thought. Do you have to have to? It's a thought. Because the commitment is, to the best of my ability, my corporate worship given unto God is going to be a non-negotiable in my life.</p><p>It should be such a staple that my children don't even bother asking me, can I please go with my friends to watch a movie on Sunday? Because they know I never, never skip church for fishing, any other hobby, any other event. Let them know if my parents come into town, because I always make sure that I worship God corporately.</p><p>Amen? Okay. That being said, I do want to share this interesting, this quote. It says, if it's important to you, you will find a way. If it's not, you will find an excuse. It's just a saying. It's not like the Word of God. It's just a saying that if it is of that high of a value system priority for you, this idea of scheduling everything, making everything else have to step around it is possible.</p><p>Yes. Imagine if you went into a commitment that you're going to play softball every Sunday for 13 weeks in this season. Now, I know some of you guys do, and thank goodness it's in the evening, right? But imagine if it was Sunday right at that time, 9 to 12, you know?</p><p>What do you think we would say? Like, oh, Pastor Martin, do you think it's okay to schedule 13 weeks missing it? It's like, you know, sometimes commitment is good, but sometimes commitment still can be vanity because the object of your commitment is not Christ and His church. Right? Now, did you guys get time to read all the silly excuses?</p><p>I just put that up there because some of this stuff happened just in the last several years. You know, silly NorCal people are like, but the Niners. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. That was a long time ago. Sorry, I just made some enemies. My fault. But you guys know, in recent history, Christmas fell on a Sunday.</p><p>And then there was this weird hoopla amongst the Christian community, like at large in America, where some people were like, oh my gosh, it's on a Sunday. What are we supposed to do? It's family time. And I'm sitting here like, what? It fell on a Sunday. Woo-hoo! We're going to church together.</p><p>And I'm going to get all suited up because what a special day. This doesn't always happen, right? Because we're going to give God worship together. And the reason why I keep saying that little phrase over and over again is because now I want to go into the perspective and attitude that will fuel this kind of application in our hearts.</p><p>And the first perspective, we all know that God called for specifically corporate worship. What did God want to see? Is He happy that you are worshiping in your car as you're driving to work? Amen. Keep doing it. Don't stop. Sitting at the top of your lungs in your car, you know, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>But to say, because I've done that, that there was a generation of people who are this kind of weird mantra of like, the church is not within the walls and the church can be anywhere. It can be in my living room. I mean, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You abiding in God can be everywhere.</p><p>But don't say the church is just anywhere, right? Why? Because God called for corporate worship. Psalm 95, 1 through 7. O come, let us sing for joy to the Lord. Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving. Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.</p><p>For the Lord is a great God and a great King above all gods, whose hands are the depths of the earth, the peaks of the mountains are His also. The sea is His, for it is He who made it, and His hands formed a dry land. And again, in this poetic, repetitive term, it's a call to worship, drawing out the worshiper to join in the assembly.</p><p>God has called us to join together in the assembly to His praises, and a New Testament corollary to that is in Romans 15, verse 5 through 6. Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>And so if we think about this, we are saying that God has designed then, if sometimes we shouldn't be thinking of it, but here and now it's so much emphasis on singing to the Lord and our voices raised aloud, right? Let's say God desired actually whether your voice is great or not, to join in the choir.</p><p>And He said, choir meeting Sunday morning at 8, 9.30, and 11.30, right? And we said, no, no, no, we can sing anywhere. The question we have to ask then is not just simply, did I sing, but did I sing in the way God desired? And what He desired was the joint voices of His church.</p><p>Does that make sense? Let me put it another way. Unfortunately, during the COVID time, there was for us a weird, weird situation. Everybody was scattered at home, okay? That was a very difficult, very chaotic, and strange situation. One of the bad fruits that came out of that was this kind of mentality that's like, oh, you know what?</p><p>I can actually get everything I need to get through the video. I can sing at home. I could watch. I could get the sermon. And there was this weird phrase that I heard from people from side to side. Sometimes they'll miss Sunday and be like, it's okay, I got the sermon.</p><p>Okay, to say it's okay, I got the sermon, you get maybe one point. At least you got the sermon and you followed along in the biblical teaching. But you understand how insufficient that is, right? And that's my point, is did God receive our sincere corporate united voice and worship That's the more appropriate question.</p><p>On Sunday morning, did God get what he wanted? Did God get the beautiful, pleasing sight of his children joined together, praising his name? God deserves that. But subtly, even sometimes for us who've just been regular to church and we're serving hard, there can be this weird thought in our mind, subtly, the object changes to, I got what I needed from the service, which is encouragement, inspiration, and also biblical teaching.</p><p>Does that make sense? And so we need to be careful of that. So, I move on to the second perspective and attitude, which is the grand privilege. Being able to join together as a group, remember, for the longest time, was actually not allowed for all of us who aren't Jewish.</p><p>We were outside the commonwealth of Israel. We were not allowed to go into the temple. We were the goyim, the ethne, the unholy ones, the untouchables. The list can go on, right? You weren't allowed to gather. It was a massive privilege for us to gather in person. And so, in the book of Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 19, it says, Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil that is his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</p><p>So, the perspective here in this passage has so many, since then, the perspective of understanding what a massive and grand privilege it is to enter in, right? To not be anymore in the outer courts. And so, he says, since we have this immense privilege to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, and he describes in this passage that there is this anticipation of a new life.</p><p>Verse 20 says, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil. Still, the imagery is there is this massive veil, and there's a new way, busting through, that kind of thing, right? Point three, since we have a great priest over the house, and for us, having this clarity of conscience because we've been washed.</p><p>You're not a person who's supposed to scream unclean and clean. You weren't the outcast, or you were the outcast, but now because of Christ, you're allowed to enter in. And therefore, since you have this privilege, then let us hold fast the confidence of our hope without wavering. For he who promised is faithful, and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.</p><p>So, the attitude, if you understand truly, the massive, massive privilege, I feel like somebody who really, really understands this, and they walk into the church, and they're just like, oh my gosh, we get to go in, and they're natural, if they really understand it, it's like, come on everybody, we get to go in, right?</p><p>We'd almost be like, dude, calm down. Right? But that individual who is overjoyed to come assemble is right. He doesn't need to calm down. It's a massive privilege. And therefore, for us, out of, because we have other, too many other things going on, because of our, whatever the reason, sometimes we're just discouraged.</p><p>Because sometimes we ourselves are just burdened with some kind of guilt. Let me ask you a question. Because those of you guys who are long-term members, and you have been really, really faithful to church on Sunday, can I ask you, would you know how to inspire and encourage a younger believer, or maybe a new member, and you find this young individual didn't come to church?</p><p>Month later, you're just like, what happened? And that individual says to you, man, I'm messed up. And maybe it was just such a common sin as I was tired at the end of the week, and I gave in to watching some inappropriate movie, and then I fell into pornography, and then I felt so guilty.</p><p>And then he says, and you know, I didn't want to be a hypocrite, so I didn't come. Would you know what to say? You should. Because every single one of us would have the responsibility to motivate and inspire, right? and to say, dude, you messed up twice. Yeah, that's okay.</p><p>That's not what you say, okay? That's not what you say. You say, no, like, I get it. You felt weak, and you felt guilty, and you felt burdened, and you gave in to your flesh that said, go hide in a hole. Don't give in to your flesh. Did you read this passage?</p><p>Show them this passage, right? Let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean. God knew we had evil conscience, and God knew we have evil desires. Who washes us? God has set the regular attendance on Sunday to be a purifying event for us.</p><p>Amen? You should have come 15 minutes early and prayed with me. Come to church. That's not the time to go hide. And so the attitude is, I will go. I'll go. I'll go in confession. I'll go in holding the hope. I'll go unwavering. I'll show up. I'm going to consider how to stimulate a brother.</p><p>This is not just for me. This is for all of us. Together. Corporately as a whole. That's the right attitude. And then the passage says, it commands us, don't forsake the gathering, as some are in the habit of doing. Why do you think they were in the habit of doing that?</p><p>I think those of you guys who know the context of Hebrews, they were being persecuted like crazy. There were imprisonments, public, you know, ridicule, and some had their property taken away. These individuals were maybe tempted to be like, so long as I don't show up, I'm safe. Right? Okay.</p><p>Let that be an encouragement to us. For whatever reason we think is valid, who are not going to church on Sunday, let that be a challenge for us in terms of their context and where they were at. So, what's really interesting is in Hebrews chapter 12, verse 3 through 4, it talks about, and you have not resisted to the point of bloodshed, and a lot of people just simply stop at, you have to resist sin, you know, do that radical amputation, fight hard, and then chapter 12 talks about how God will discipline his children.</p><p>It's true. But what's really interesting is there's an added phrase that you have not resisted to the point of bloodshed from the hostility of the sinners, meaning, meaning, that some of them, because of their fear of persecution, were not front and center worshiping God, were flaking on their commitments to come to service, and there's a challenge.</p><p>Even your fear of the persecution and the hardships by men, let's lay that at the feet of the cross. Now, the third perspective and attitude is to be spirit-filled participants, active participants, rather than passive observers, and that's why we read that wonderful passage in Acts chapter 2, verse 41 through 47.</p><p>It says here, So then, those who had received his word were baptized, and that day there were added about 3,000 souls. That to me is crazy. 3,000 individuals one day, boom, mega church, you know, just chaos, I don't know. Verse 42, But they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.</p><p>Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe, and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. And so what we find here is that the spirit-filled, active members devoting themselves to simply the fellowship of genuine believers was awesome. Okay? It was awesome. My challenge sometimes is to think that, like, I gotta be honest, like, there are days when I look at, just being honest with you on a certain topic, there are days when I worry that our Sunday service is dry.</p><p>You know what I'm talking about? Like, people worshiping, like, their bouncers at the, you know, staying there like this. You know, I gotta be honest with you, for me, I did get saved at a charismatic church, and I got saved that, like, we had every Saturday night revivals, you know?</p><p>So I do realize that I may have, like, a little bit of a, kind of skewed view of what I expect and that kind of stuff. But as I was thinking that, I was kind of thinking, wait a minute, what am I thinking? And the reason why is because when you look at this passage, the amazement, the joy, the kind of gladness to be together doesn't come from the structure or just simply, like, the tone of singing or stuff that the leadership does or maybe Elder Joe just plays that riff real hard.</p><p>that's not the stuff that's supposed to bring me this, wow, right? Why? Because the time is set and the person who is bringing the faith and the passion, you and me, right? And we're happy to be engrossed in that kind of fellowship together. Continuing on, verse 44, it says, and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all and as anyone might have need.</p><p>We're in couponers, it's a biblical thing. Just kidding, sorry. Verse 46, day by day, continuing with one mind in the temple, breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p><p>And what I realized is that voluntary active participants in the building up of the house of God and the love of Christ is amazing. And when you're not doing that, it's easy to skip church. The challenge is for us, I want to give you this challenge, although the church is getting bigger, please never have this mentality, since there's over 1,200 people, no one will notice if I skip.</p><p>Not true. I see. I'm just kidding. I don't see. I see all. No, I don't see all, but biblically speaking, not true. Why? Because that church coming together on Sunday, everything involved, not just the hour, but everything involved surrounding the gathering, the assembly, is a beautiful thing in God's eyes, meant to be a spirit-filled day of the believers who are voluntarily participating in life together, right?</p><p>And so for you to excuse yourself from that and to think that no one will notice, not true. Not true. It's kind of like being on a basketball team, not coming out to a game and being like, I don't think anybody's going to notice. Not true. And so I have here, we will never actually be a healthy church if we allow casual and convenient absences from corporate worship, right?</p><p>I mean, we understand that. We've all been a part of some kind of commitment, played sports in high school, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, in order to really, really have a healthy team, you actually kind of need what? Like regular, regular presence. Even if you're hurt, you're there at the game, right?</p><p>Even if there is practice, you're there at the practice. When there is team, like hang out because you need to get to know the coach and you need to get to have team camaraderie with the other teammates, you're there. Why? Because to think that you just half-heartedly going in and out and yet you're still going to have this winning team is nonsensical.</p><p>But again, I did say, although yes, that kind of commitment analogy, having a noble, like build-up of discipline and investment makes sense, then how much more on something spiritual? How much more on something where we can nobly say I have had, I have as my vision my highest level of commitment to build what God wanted us to build and to give to God what He deserves.</p><p>The corporate body coming together and praising His name with one voice. That's a vision and we all have to have it. Amen? Concluding thought. So what are you saying, Pastor Mark? I can't go see my favorite preacher over at wherever he may be preaching. What are you saying, Pastor Mark?</p><p>It's Christmas. I can't do family worship. We're doing family worship, though. I thought that was an appropriate passage. We're not, as a church leadership, going to be able to tell you yes and no, draw the line on every circumstance and situation that exists in your life. And the stuff that we're not saying is not to just simply be like, boo, on everything else you have going on in your life.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 7, it says, this I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord. Do you guys remember where this context is from? It's in the context of Him saying to men, you actually technically don't need a wife.</p><p>I wish some of you were like me so that your devotion would be pure. So let that be as a challenge to us. Yes, you will have to sacrifice to make this a high, high priority, but see if you can do it. You know? And yes, some of you guys are in a situation where there are no negotiating with your bosses or whatever it may be, so it may be the case.</p><p>Then let's make sure we do all due diligence to give God what He deserves. that when you have the opportunity, even if you're dead tired, that you schedule first the corporate worship that God deserves. For the Lord is worthy of all of our voices singing together. Amen? Let's take a moment to pray.</p><p>Our God, we know that in the ages past, for your glory and for the good of the people, you set a pattern where you said man will work for six days, but on the seventh day he will rest in the Lord, and that day is holy. And then God, thanks be to the Lord, we're not threatened with death because we worked on Sunday, but rather you have said Christ fulfilled our true rest.</p><p>But Father God, you have also set in motion and patterned the corporate gathering of the church. I ask that by faith, Sunday service, or any service for that matter, would not be any chore for us, would not be burdensome, but it would be so refreshing where we can praise you, we can joyously sing, we can proclaim you, we can come and express the love of Christ, and we can build one another up.</p><p>Let it be such a sweet time for us. And I ask God that as it is so fulfilling and rewarding to see your kingdom grow, let it be truly glorifying to you. We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen. Okay, so, first, Bible passages? Next week's Bible passages are here, if you want to take a quick snapshot to get an early heads up, or, as you know, both on our Facebook and email threads, it'll go out to you guys, the next week's passage, and our next commitment is going to be commitment number five to regular attendance at midweek Bible study, okay?</p><p>Then, discussion for you guys, please go ahead and do some evaluation, what are some threats, just generally in our culture that you see, but also for your own life? Secondly, how can we, some ideas, or how have you, maybe just more recently, plan to maintain our Sunday worship priorities, okay?</p><p>And then, kind of an interesting one, how would you reply to somebody who's just like, they're here, but they're just complaining like, oh, I don't like this style of music, you know? I don't know why they're trying to sing more hymns, or I don't know why the people are like this, and I don't know why it's like this, and they give those excuses as to why they don't want to come, et cetera.</p><p>How would you respond to that, just thinking through what we thought about today, about these higher priorities of God and our calling that we have, okay? Alright, please go ahead and go into discussion. We'll see you guys next time. on the next one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
