hoping to take a look at this passage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=154s">00:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">see is how this kind of living, the kind of living that this rich young ruler lived, might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=161s">00:02:41.080</a></span> | <span

class="t">It threatens our ability to live following Jesus on a day-to-day basis, and it also threatens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=174s">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the joy that we might have in following him as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=178s">00:02:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look down at the passage in verse 17 through 22, it kind of pinballs back and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=182s">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">forth from here's the rich young ruler, then Jesus, then rich young ruler, then Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=186s">00:03:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then rich young ruler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=188s">00:03:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So in verse 17, if you look there, it says that this man runs up to him and he says this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=192s">00:03:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal

salvation?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=204s">00:03:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in verse 18, Jesus responds to that, he says, "Why do you call me good?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=207s">00:03:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is a weird

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=211s">00:03:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus tends to do this every once in a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=214s">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Someone will come up with this, I mean, we would say this was a great question, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=219s">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What must I do to inherit eternal life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=222s">00:03:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just kind of do a double-take on Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=225s">00:03:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why does he focus on this title that this man has given to him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=229s">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, "No one is good except God alone."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=232s">00:03:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Jesus says, "You know the commandments, do not murder."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=234s">00:03:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And he continues to go and he lists out six different commandments.</span></div><div class="c"><span

him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288761578#t=252s">00:04:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says to him, "Well, you're lacking one
