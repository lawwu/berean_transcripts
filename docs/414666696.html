statements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/414666696#t=417s">00:06:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"I am the way, the truth, and the life," I divided it

of all, give them comfort, because they were very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/414666696#t=428s">00:07:08.080</a></span> | <span

them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/414666696#t=441s">00:07:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think every truth that we learn in scripture really

the world, we need to recognize that he is sovereign, not us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/414666696#t=477s">00:07:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it equips us to strengthen us for the work that he has given us to do to be the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/414666696#t=482s">00:08:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to look at each one of these things in these two categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span
