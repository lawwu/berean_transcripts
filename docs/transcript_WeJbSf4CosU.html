We have quite a few announcements, and I'm going to start with Pastor Peter Chung who is going to come up and he has some announcements about our shuttle system. >> All right, good morning. I just wanted to let you guys know over the last couple of months we've had a couple of incidences where people have invited people to church, but because they couldn't find parking, they just took off.</p><p>And so we are having problems with our parking, we are having problems just with our seating. So we did start up a shuttle ministry that's actually going to start launching next Sunday. So the hours are, the times are 8.15, 10.15, 12.15, so every other hour on the 15th minute for about an hour.</p><p>So if you guys can, if you want to park at the farther lots, the addresses are on there, audio images, and then the engineering firm, if you guys put that in your navigation and park at the far lots, they have two golf carts and a shuttle van just running to bring you here.</p><p>Or you can just walk it. At most it will take seven minutes if you have normal length legs. It's about a 785 step count. I actually did the numbers there. So it's not a far distance, but there will be a shuttle picking you up and bringing you here. So if you guys can, leave the closer lots for the parents of smaller children and newcomers, they're not going to quite know where to park.</p><p>So that's the first request that we do have as our church is getting a little bit bigger. Today it doesn't look like as much of a problem, but normally our second service is pretty packed. So if our ushers ask you to move on up, please do, just oblige. Just get into the habit of sitting up closer so that as people arrive late, they can occupy the back seats.</p><p>Don't glare at them. They are serving the Lord in the best way they can. So those are the two announcements. The shuttle service starts next week. So keep an eye out for that. And please do participate the best you can with this request. Okay, thank you. - All right, so along with that, as you guys know, today is Father's Day.</p><p>And so as you're walking in, you probably saw the booths out there. And there is a picture taking place. So if you want to take pictures with your father, there's a station that's reserved for that. And also the tables, you can just kind of go up and grab, I think they have lemonade cookies, homemade cookies that the children and the moms made.</p><p>And then also beef jerky. Just make sure that's distinguished from Mother's Day and Father's Day. So that's going on. So as you're going out, and if your wife is pregnant and you want to make an announcement today, you're also welcome to go to the table. And we'll quietly acknowledge what's going on.</p><p>Okay, so just go out there and make sure after service just go visit and grab your goodie bags, okay? Brian, membership class, the next session is starting on Sunday, July 9th. So please sign up for that if you are intending to become a member of the church. And that's taking place July 9th through September 3rd, 9 to 10, 20 a.m.</p><p>in the other building. So if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up for that. Jubilee Fellowship, if you are 50 and over, on next Sunday at 1 p.m. for the second service, there will be a luncheon. So if you're 50 and over, and so that lunch is $12, and Elder Phillip is going to be taking charge of that, so please let him know that you are coming.</p><p>One last announcement. All church retreat. We have quite a few who have already signed up, but because the hotel has given us a hard line June 25th as the last day that we can go and get the special rate that they've given us, and so if you haven't signed up, if you end up signing up after July 25th or June 25th, which is next Sunday, what's going to happen is there will be a separate retreat fee from the church, and then you will have to contact the hotel and end up paying the fee that they want you to pay, or you might have to go offsite to be able to do that.</p><p>But if you are planning to go and you haven't, June 25th will be the last day that you'll be able to register through the normal way. Okay? I think that's it. And one other thing is, we have our first Korea mission team that's going to be headed out, and we're going to the airport on the 22nd, and the 22nd is Thursday, and then we're flying out at 12 o'clock a.m., and so that's happening.</p><p>And so just to kind of give you a heads up, there's 20 of us that are going. Pastor Nate and myself will be leading the team, and we're there for three weeks. And so there's quite a few things that we're doing. Our main goal is to reach the college campuses, the Korean-speaking students at Yonsei, at Hongdae, at Myeongji, and Ewha Womans University, like that area.</p><p>And so as I've mentioned before, our denomination, the mission wing of our denomination, they're called the International Mission Board, IMB, has designated South Korea as a receiving nation now. So for the longest time, Korea was a sending nation, meaning it was the second largest missionary sending nation in the world.</p><p>But as quickly as Christianity inclined in Korea, it is declining at an alarming speed. So there's previously, the number of people who claim to be Christian was about 33%, but now when we get to the Gen Z, the students, college students and younger, is less than 3%. Some is less than 2%.</p><p>So in one generation, that many people are walking out of the church, and so they're inviting people to come back out to South Korea, and they're starting to send mission teams out there. And so we're one of the first teams that are going in, hoping to make contact there.</p><p>And sad thing is, that they're not close to Christianity. They've been so disappointed by Christianity in Korea, they're more willing to talk to foreign students to share the gospel with them. And so it kind of puts them in a unique place where we can go and share the gospel, even though they'll speak broken English, they're more willing to talk to us about Christianity, because they know how much of a positive impact Christianity has had in that country.</p><p>Most of the universities, hospitals, major stuff in Korea, has some sort of a mission work behind it. So they know that Christianity was vital to the success of Korea. And so they're open. They have positive views of Christianity, but they don't trust Christianity in Korea. So when other missionaries and other people come, they're more willing to talk to us.</p><p>So we're trying to use that as an opening to go in and share the gospel. So while we're there for three weeks, we're going to be engaged in street evangelism, busking, if you know what that is, that's the first thing that I, you know, the new term that I learned.</p><p>They're street performing and attracting people. We have open cafe, English cafes, where we're going to be sharing the gospel with people. We're going to be doing some homeless ministry. We're going to be visiting orphanages. We're running an English camp to recruit students and share the gospel with them. We're running an international camp.</p><p>So we're going to be very busy during the three weeks that we're there. So if you guys can keep us in your prayers that we will be fruitful. And we're praying that the contacts that we make this year will help us to focus our attention on where would be the most fruitful and effective way to go out there and start ministry.</p><p>So we're leaving this Thursday and we'll be out for about three weeks. And then we'll be back. Okay, so please keep that in your prayer. After I pray for the offering, our brother Daniel is going to come up and he's going to give his testimony and be baptized. And those of you who have physical offerings, again, we have a box in the back on the way out.</p><p>You can drop off your offering there if you have a physical offering. All right, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued blessing over our lives. We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us. That we can be the light wherever you send us. Not only in Korea, India, China, and various places, Lord God, that you have sent us.</p><p>Help us, Lord, first and foremost, to be missionaries at home. Help us, Lord, to live as if we're just passing through. To see things from an eternal perspective. To see things from a spiritual perspective. Help us to be a light in this dark world. That all that we do, Father God, would bring glory to your name.</p><p>We pray that even in our offering, that you would help us to give in a manner of worship. That it may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the purpose of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

That begins with God's presence among his people. So as we continue to worship, let us welcome, let us cherish that presence that is among us and how God works in the midst of his people.</p><p>So praise him for that.

If I do cough during this testimony, I hope that you can excuse me. My parents and my oldest brother moved to America in 1993. Within the next four years, my mother bore three additional sons, with me being the youngest boy.</p><p>After an additional three years, my parents felt called by God to move back to Asia, into China. With no choice, we followed our parents to a new world. Growing up in China, my parents taught me everything they knew about God and Christianity. Knowing that we were being raised in a country that was hostile towards Christians, they made sure and prayed for other missionary families to arrive and provide support for both them and us four boys.</p><p>God answered their prayers, and as more missionary families arrived, we were able to create a missionary community. We would live life with one another, pray for one another, and support one another. However, as years passed, being a missionary kid and a Christian was just a way of life and nothing more.</p><p>I lacked true, consistent authenticity in my beliefs, and merely learned to act like a Christian, whilst knowing what it took to look like the good Christian kid I thought I was supposed to be. As my brothers all graduated and moved back to America for college, my parents sent me to Thailand, where I lived in a dorm and graduated from an international high school.</p><p>I moved back to America, where I attended Wheaton College, a Christian college in Illinois. However, despite attending a Christian college, I continued to live a life that held onto the desires of the world. After my four years of undergrad, I graduated and moved to Chicago for two years, and then to Irvine two years after that.</p><p>Because my parents were missionaries, I had to learn to become independent and self-sufficient early on in my life, as I stayed in the mission field while I left them at the early age of 15 in Thailand. With no safety net and no permanent family base, self-preservation became essential for me.</p><p>During school, as all my friends left to go home, I needed to figure out where I would be living before the next school year would start. I worked all year round to support myself financially and began to learn how to cook Korean and Chinese food to save money to also grasp onto any bit of home that felt familiar.</p><p>I felt so alone and abandoned. I was bitter and angry at God and was so tired of just living to survive. But deep down, I longed to be saved and knew that God was the ultimate truth. When I moved here to Irvine, I expressed a desire to come back to church.</p><p>A year from my move, I started to attend a Korean and was invited to come out to Bible study. I continued to attend Sunday service, Bible study, and church-organized events. Gradually, day by day, God started to heal my heart and to reveal himself to me. One night, as I was alone in my room, I broke down as I realized that he had never left me, even in my lowest moments, and that he had been with me every step of the way throughout my entire life.</p><p>Even when I cursed him and gave up on him countless times, he still waited patiently to welcome me back into his loving arms. As I saw and felt his love, I felt so unworthy of it and was in disbelief that he sees me even after all of my sin and all the hatred I held towards him.</p><p>I know and trust in his love because the life that I have lived up to this point of living abroad as a missionary family, of being sent away from family for schooling, of learning to live and figure out life independently on my own, all of this is a testament to his faithfulness to me.</p><p>Even when I felt like I was navigating life on my own, he always opened and closed the right doors, brought me the right people at the right times, and never provided less than what I needed. As I reflected then and there in my room, I repented of a life of self-seeking and having myself as the number one priority and vowed instead to dedicate my life to seeking out his will and to glorify him always.</p><p>Since then, I have dedicated my life to him and have strived to put him first before my own life. I have looked to him to transform my old life into a new one, with him at the center of it all. And even through my failures, I pray that he would use them to grow and strengthen me to love him and those around me even more.</p><p>I know this is just the beginning of my journey, but out of the sincerity of my heart, I long to know and love him more each and every day. I understand that it will not be easy, but if this is the path to take, then I refuse to live an easy life.</p><p>Thank you. Do you understand when you go into the water, you're being united to Christ's death? When you're coming out, you're united to the resurrected life? I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thank you, Daniel, for that powerful testimony. If you can turn your Bibles with me to Galatians 4.</p><p>Verse 6 and 7. So it is Father's Day, and we wanted to take at least today to address an issue of what does it mean to be a father. So I'll be reading from Galatians 4, 6 and 7. "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.' Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God." Let's pray.</p><p>Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom. We pray for grace. We pray for hearts that are eager to be molded, that we do not filter your word based upon our own prejudice, our own desires of the flesh. Help us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind according to your word.</p><p>Teach us, guide us, lead us, rebuke us, establish us, sanctify us. We entrust this time to you, Lord. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. I think those of you guys who have been at our church for a while know that years ago, every Mother's Day and Father's Day, I used to give Mother's Day sermons and Father's Day sermon, and I kind of stopped that for a little bit and spent the day glorifying somebody else outside of our Heavenly Father.</p><p>But I did want to spend at least today talking about what it means to be a father because of what's happening in our culture. If you guys know, in 1 Corinthians 16, 13, the context of this verse is where Apostle Paul spends the whole letter kind of rebuking and challenging the leaders and the members of the church in Corinth.</p><p>All kinds of chaos has been coming into this church. There's division, immorality, the worship was done in vain, it was out of order for seeking self-glory. And so as a result of that, the church was being ruined. And so after chapters of writing and what to be corrected, in 1 Corinthians 16, 13, Paul kind of concludes the letter by saying, "Be on alert, stand firm in the faith, and act like men, be strong." Act like men.</p><p>In the NIV, it says to be men of courage. And the reason why the NIV translated it that way is because it's-- what does it mean to act like men? So they've kind of translated it, so, well, it means to be courageous. In the Greek, that's not how it's spelled or formulated.</p><p>It just says act like men. You should have understood what that meant, act like men. But what does that mean today, to act like men? Be a man. What does that mean? In fact, it almost sounds like it's wrong to say be a man because of the culture that we live in.</p><p>You're a misogynist, you're a sexist, you're toxic masculinity. What does it mean to be a man? We need to make sure that we have a clear biblical understanding of what it means to be a man, that we do not follow the pattern that we are being forced in our culture, in schools, in our universities, and even at work.</p><p>What does it mean to be a man? You know, it's interesting that Time magazine had an article in May 22nd, in the year 2000, called "The Hottest Jobs of the Future." And obviously, the year 2000, there was a revolution of computers that were taking place and the world was going to change, and they were saying that in this article, that there are some jobs that are going to become obsolete in the next century because of the computer revolution.</p><p>And in the list of jobs that are disappearing in the next century, it says fatherhood is going to disappear. The occupation or the position of father is going to disappear. And in the article, it says in between, "Ditro fertilization and cloning, dads could become dinosaurs." That's what it says in this article, and this was written in the year 2000.</p><p>Now, 23 years have gone by, and you could see now how the world has become hostile toward fatherhood and just manhood in general. In fact, it's beginning to penetrate into the church. Certain doctrines that we have held for centuries are being challenged, not because of new revelation of what the Bible says, because of the pressure of the secular world.</p><p>Some of you guys may remember, not that long ago, we switched from using the NIV to NASB, and the main reason why is because the people who own the rights to the NIV has publicly stated that they are going to make all the pronouns gender neutral. Not because the Bible--they found some new revelation in the Bible, but simply because they needed to sell more Bibles.</p><p>That if they don't make it gender neutral, it's not going to be palatable to the masses. So in order to keep their business alive, they said they're going to make everything gender neutral, or else the Bible's not going to sell, and the NIV's going to die, so in order for their own survival.</p><p>Since then, many translations, even the more literal translations, are beginning to cave to pressure. And that pressure basically is if we do not go gender neutral, you're not going to be able to survive as a business. You can hold on to your principles, but what good is it if you can't sell Bibles?</p><p>So more and more, Bible translations are turning to gender neutral, and as a result of that, it's beginning to confuse the church, and even the pulpit. What does it mean to be a man? Any of you who own pets, right? I don't know if all of you have done it, but even the cats that we have, it was kind of a given understanding that if you're going to own pets, you have to neuter them, right?</p><p>Not have to, but you just kind of--that's just the culture. And the whole purpose of neutering them is so that they can't reproduce. You don't want unwanted cats or dogs running around, and so if you want to own a pet, and purely for the enjoyment of the owners. I can't think of a more fitting illustration about what's going on with our pets to what's happening with our men in our culture.</p><p>Men are becoming neutered, and the purpose of neutering is so that you cannot reproduce. That whatever was passed down from generation, that it's going to stop here. And they are actively trying to neuter manhood so that people are confused. What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be a father?</p><p>What is the call of a father? And so that's why I felt compelled to address this issue in our church, and there might be some things that I will say that may not be comfortable with some of you in the church, but in order to make a stand against what's happening in our culture, I felt it necessary, at least today, to clarify what the scripture teaches of the calling of man.</p><p>The origin of understanding of God the Father, it actually has--it's placed in the Bible from the beginning. God himself calls himself the Father of Israel, but it's almost never used in a personal sense where an individual calls God the Father. That idea of a personal relationship of God being the Father is introduced to us by Christ.</p><p>He uses 165 different times in the Bible to address God as Father. Prior to that, it would be Elohim or Lord, and his name may have been used, or it would be God addressing Israel as himself as the Father. But this personal address as God being the Father was pretty much introduced by Christ himself.</p><p>In Mark 14, verse 36, Jesus calls God Abba Father as he is wrestling at the Garden of Gethsemane, if there another way. And then it's spelled out in John 5, 16-18, and it gives the reason why they hated Jesus, and this is what it says. "For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</p><p>But he answered them, 'My Father is working until now, and I myself am working. For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.'" Did you notice that?</p><p>He says, "For this reason." They are persecuting Jesus because he was not obeying the Sabbath law. And so they were breaking their tradition, so they were persecuting him. But he said they wanted to kill him for this reason, because he started calling God his Father, making himself equal with God.</p><p>What's interesting about the introduction of this term, or at least the way Jesus is addressing God, is something that he did not only for himself, but the whole reason why he came is so that we may be restored to our personal relationship with God the Father. That he's not just some being from a distance, that somebody that we admire from a distance, but that he wanted to make God our Abba Father.</p><p>So in Romans 8, 15-17, it says, "For you have not received the spirit of slavery, leading to the fear again, but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by which we cry, 'Abba, Father.'" The whole purpose of salvation is our adoption. Not simply so that he can save us from hell, not simply so that your sins could be forgiven, but your sins needed to be forgiven.</p><p>Our sins had to be atoned for in order that we may be adopted, that we too may be able to call God our Abba Father. Verse 18, "For this reason," sorry, verse 16, "the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God, and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, so that we may also be glorified with him." And again, in Galatians 4, 6-7, "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of sons into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.' Therefore you are no longer slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God." So the whole purpose of salvation is not simply so that we don't go to hell, but it's to reconcile us with the Holy Father, that we may ourselves address him as Abba Father.</p><p>So you can say you know God, you can say that you believe God, but the whole purpose of salvation is to be able to say he is our Abba Father. Abba Father, a personal relationship with God. You may have heard before a cliche, "Christianity is not about a religion, it's about a relationship." Now some people have used that, and abused that, to use it in a way that benefits them, but at the core of the message, it's true.</p><p>You can claim to know God, you can claim to worship God, you can claim to serve God, but you missed the whole point, if you do not understand if he is not your Abba Father. He's not the one that you run to for refuge, he's not the one that you run to when you are in danger, and when you are in need.</p><p>You know what's interesting is this term Abba Father, like some people have said, "No, Abba means it's an intimate word, Daddy." Right, and so some people have said, "Well it means Daddy." And they're not necessarily completely wrong, but that's not exactly what it means. In fact, the word Abba is the Aramaic term for Dad, for Father.</p><p>So it's no different than the next word, Father. So what's happening here, Abba Father, is using the former Hebrew and Aramaic term for Father, and then the word that's translated Father here, is a Greek term, pater. So what's happening here is that Paul is using the term Abba Father, and if you were to understand it, it would basically mean, and I'm going to use Korean because I know Korean better, it means Abba Father.</p><p>It means the same thing. Abba Father basically means Father, Father. This is not ever translated Daddy, because that's not what this word means. It's just a general word for Father. Now why does he do that? What is the purpose of that? So if you were to read this in context, and if you understood the meaning of Abba Father, Father, Father, you know why certain things are repeated in the Bible, right?</p><p>When Jesus wanted to say something very serious and needed Peter's attention, "Hey Peter, I know you have ADD, but pay attention. "Peter, Peter, I say to you, like pay attention." Or if he had something really important to say, "Truly, truly I say to you," and he repeated it twice.</p><p>So a Jew would have understood to cry Abba Father was for the purpose of emphasis, that this is the point that he's trying to get at. He's not just simply saying, "He reconciled us to Abba Fa," so we can call him Abba Father. He said, "He reconciled us so that we can call him "Abba Father, Father." The fatherhood of God in our lives is the reason for the gospel.</p><p>That's the first reason why he uses the term Abba Father. The second term is related to why some people do translate this Daddy, because it's an intimate term. Not necessarily Daddy, right? Some people may use that, but it is a more personal, it is more intimate in the Aramaic.</p><p>And so he's saying that he's not just talking about God, as in he's on his throne. He's talking about our dads, like personally. And so in the book of Hebrews, is that to bridge the gap between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. Why did God do what he did in the Old Covenant, and what does that mean in the New Covenant?</p><p>And so in the book of Hebrews, the whole emphasis is about bringing us to God, reconciling us to God. So Hebrews chapter 4, 15, it says, "Therefore let us draw near with confidence." Why did he have the sacrificial system? Why was there the priesthood of Melchizedek? Why was the tabernacle established?</p><p>Why were the sacrifices? He said, "All of this is so that we may have confidence to draw near, that we may see him as our Abba Father." And this is repeated over and over again in the book of Hebrews, chapter 7, verse 19, 25. And then in Hebrews chapter 10, 19-22, "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he inaugurated for us through the veil that is his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water." So just to summarize, the whole point of the gospel is to reconcile us to our Abba Father.</p><p>So if you worship him, you honor him, you believe him, but you don't go to him, you miss the whole point of salvation. The reason why the barrier was taken away is not so that we can come on Sunday and celebrate the barrier being gone. Look how much the barrier is gone.</p><p>Look what Jesus did so that there's no barrier between us and God. Isn't God awesome? And to worship him and point to him and celebrate him from a distance. The whole point of the barrier being gone is so that we can get to him. So the whole book of Hebrews to reconcile what happened in the Old Testament to the New Testament is because of that, we are able to call him our Abba Father and draw near to him.</p><p>So if you do not draw near, you miss the whole point. If all you do is celebrate and honor him from a distance. You know what's really interesting about all of this? And again, I think we all understand why some people say, "Oh, this is equivalent to daddy." I don't think it's equivalent to daddy, but there is some truth to that.</p><p>But I remember when my children were younger, and some of you guys' older parents may relate, once they hit kind of like pre-teen, pre-puberty, all of a sudden they have to be cool, and they go from daddy to dad. And I remember my oldest son, when he was about fifth grade, he came home from school and one day he said, "Hey, dad." And I don't know why, that just hit me wrong.</p><p>Like, "Dad, I'm not your dad. I'm your daddy."  "I'm not ready to accept you as grown up. I want to hold on to you a little bit longer." So I asked him, like, "Not yet. You're not ready." Actually, it was more me. I'm not ready. So from that point on, he went back to calling me daddy, and then all the other siblings followed suit, and they started calling me daddy, and to this day they call me daddy.</p><p>They whisper it when there's other people around. And I prefer it. I prefer it because there's an intimacy, right? And again, I'm not saying that this is true in every family, but I know other families do the same, right? Because personally, I just don't want to be a figurehead.</p><p>I want you to feel comfortable with it, like there's something personal with me, right? And the whole point of it is, again, the idea is to see him in an intimate sense, just like our brother Daniel was talking about, like just knowing that after all these years, God still loves him, God still cares for him, the doors are still open to him because he sees him as Abba Father.</p><p>You know, every once in a while, I want to meet somebody, and I'll say, "Hey, can I meet in my office?" And for whatever the reason, whenever I ask somebody to come to my office, the first thing that they ask me is, "What did I do?" Right? "Am I in trouble?" Right?</p><p>"No, no, no. That's just the easier place to meet." But my children have no problem. You know, sometimes I'll be walking in there, and I'll see one of my kids laid down taking a nap. Or they'll throw their books in there, and that's kind of like they're just keeping it there for a while.</p><p>Right? They don't have any problem coming into my room because it's their daddy's room. And so the whole purpose of salvation is to see God as our personal father, our Abba Father. And that's the way he describes heaven. Heaven is not simply a place that's just nicer, cleaner, people are better behaved.</p><p>Heaven is heaven because we're going home. That's our Father's place. That's how Jesus described it. In my Father's house, there's many rooms, and I go to prepare a room for you too. Heaven is heaven because we're going home. I know some of you guys who like to travel, but no matter how much you like to travel, you kind of hit a point where you want to go home.</p><p>Because you want to sleep on your own bed. You want to go to your own bathroom. You want to wake up in your own house. Because that's where your home is. And so that's what he was trying to convey. That the old covenant Jews were following him and trying to obey him from a distance as a figurehead, but they did not know him as their Abba Father.</p><p>And so Christ came to become a sympathetic high priest to draw us to himself. But there's another aspect of this Abba Father that's very interesting because the Hebrew word for father was Abba, not Abba. Abba was eventually kind of evolved into the Aramaic term. But in actual Hebrew in the Old Testament, the word Abba does not exist.</p><p>It says A-B, Ab. And what's interesting is the Hebrew alphabet has certain significance attached to it. So Hebrew alphabet has numbers attached. That's why people get into numerology, they study the numbers in Hebrew vocabulary and how it connects to different things. But what's also interesting is each letter has images and meaning itself.</p><p>And so if you look at the two images of these two words, Aleph and Beit, the first two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, if you can put up the picture, you guys have it. The next... Oh, what happened? Okay, so I'm just going to have to tell you, okay?</p><p>The first letter, Aleph, right, is from Ab. The picture that is attached to it is a picture of an ox. And that picture of an ox represents strength. Or oftentimes it is seen as leadership. So the letter A itself has significance. The meaning is strength and leadership. The second word, Beit, like what we would pronounce B, the picture that they have that is attached to that word, if you look at the Hebrew dictionary, is the picture of a tent, and tent meaning the home.</p><p>So when you put the two words together that is translated father in the Old Testament, it is a picture of a leader in the home. So by the very nature of the word, it describes father as leader, the person who is strong in that home. So you didn't even have to study it.</p><p>Any Jew would have been able to understand when they said father, he's talking about the strength of the home, the leader of the home. Now this is where I want to get into what does it mean to be a father in our generation? First, the idea comes from God, and then God gives it to us.</p><p>Our understanding of what it means to be a father comes from God himself. Now these four things that I want to talk about for the rest of the time that we have is not directly taught, but is inferred as God uses it to describe fatherhood. First, fathers were given the responsibility of the education of their children.</p><p>Fathers. When God gave the law to Moses and to be passed down, he intended that this education system of the law to be given from father to sons to children on and on. So fathers to fathers to fathers to fathers. And do you know what I mean? For 6, 617, 1119, on and on, he says the same thing.</p><p>Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen, and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life, but make them known to your sons and your grandsons. And this phrase is repeated over and over again.</p><p>The modern-day school system was created in 1857 during the Industrial Revolution that people were moving away from farms and they're going into the factories. So they were beginning to, parents were becoming more and more absent in the home. So as a result of that, they didn't know what to do with their children, so they came up with this corporate education where the children are sent off and the government would hire somebody to give corporate education.</p><p>And that was, you know, in the last 150 years. But after about 150 years, it became the normal way that children are raised. That you have children and you send them off for their education and then for science and that kind of stuff to public schools, and then you send them to church for spiritual education, hoping that the church will do the job.</p><p>That's why so many parents, when their children start going astray, they yell at the youth pastor. "You're not doing a good job. "My kids, you know, they don't respect me. "They're not listening. "And so you guys need to do a better job." That's a modern happening. And I used to be a youth pastor and I was yelled at myself by parents.</p><p>And I'm, you know, "What can I do? "Your kid's not showing up to church. "What can I do?" But only in the modern way of thinking, people say, "Well, you know, I had them and I feed them "and I make sure that they don't die, you know, "and I provide for them," and the rest of it is sent out.</p><p>From the get-go, God's intention of discipleship of children belonged to the father, not even the mother, but the father. In Deuteronomy 4, 9, it says, in Psalm 78, 5, 3, it says, "For he established a testimony in Jacob "and appointed a law in Israel, "which he commanded our fathers "that they should teach them to their children, "that the generation to come might know, "even the children yet to be born, "that they may arise and tell them to their children, "that they should put their confidence in God "and not forget the works of God, "but keep his commandments "and not be like their fathers, "a stubborn and rebellious generation, "a generation that did not prepare its heart "and whose spirit was not faithful to God." You notice here in verse 8, it says the reason why they're going astray is because the previous fathers did not do their job.</p><p>That's what he says. The reason why they're rebelling, reason why their hearts have not been prepared to be faithful to God is because the previous fathers did not take the responsibility. He said the education of the children was placed upon the father, the leader, the strength of the home, first and foremost, that we are not to dish this out to others.</p><p>I want to make this clear. Does the Bible say that, therefore, that you can't send them to public school or you have to send them to the-- all kids need to be homeschooled? There's no such teaching in the Bible. But principally, whichever path that you choose to take, that responsibility is not at school.</p><p>That responsibility is not at church. It's on the fathers. That's what God intended. And whichever path you take, it must be so that it's the best way to educate them, best way to disciple them, may be that path. But that responsibility was given to us as fathers. In Joshua 24, 15, as a nation of Israel are going astray, and Joshua makes a stand at the end of his life.</p><p>And he's challenging the nation of Israel because they keep going back to idols and then back to God. And this is what it says. "If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord, "choose for yourself to say whom you will serve, "whether the gods which your father served, "which were beyond the river, "or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living.</p><p>"But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." You notice here, he addresses the problem of the nation of Israel. And the way he addresses it, he says, "For me and my house, we'll serve the Lord." He doesn't say, "We need to reform the temple. "We need to reform our education system.</p><p>"We need to reform the businesses." He says, "No, for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." He starts at his home, and he challenges them, challenges other fathers. "Where are you going to stand? "Are you going to follow the pattern of this world "and go back and forth wherever it's more convenient "to follow idols, or will you make a stand?</p><p>"For me and my household, we will serve the Lord." The discipleship of our children are on the shoulders of the fathers to take care of them. We cannot dish this out, this responsibility out. I remember years ago when Billy Graham was at the beginning of his Parkinson's disease, and so they thought his ministry was going to be over.</p><p>So sometime in the 1990s, Time Magazine had an interview with him asking him, "After all these years of ministry, "if you were to go back, what would you do differently?" And I remember hearing what he said made such a huge impact on me. And they said, "This is a man who most likely "were able to preach the gospel to more people "than any person who has ever lived." I know that at the tail end of his life, there was some controversy in his ministry, but at that time, at least pure number-wise, because of technology and his traveling, that for millions of people who preached the gospel, even my own mother came to Christ through his crusades.</p><p>And they asked him, "If you were to do it over, "what would you do over again?" And he said these two things. He said, "I would have studied more, "and I would have traveled less." That's what he said. He's a man who was able to preach the gospel because he traveled, because he dedicated his life to evangelism.</p><p>But he said, "I would have studied more, "stayed put and studied more, "and I would have traveled less." So obviously, the interviewer asked him further questions, like, "What do you mean by that, travel less?" He said, "I spent so much time focused "outside what's going on "that I didn't spend enough priority on my own children." And he said, "Of all the things that he would do over again," he said, "I would do that again.</p><p>"I would make sure that I traveled less "and then studied more." We are called to disciple our children, the fathers. You don't dish that out simply to mothers, to school systems, to other places. We're responsible for that as fathers. Secondly, the fathers are responsible for the discipline in the home.</p><p>The fathers are. You can't simply say, "I don't like being that guy, "so I'm going to let the mom be the bad cop, "and I'm going to be the good cop." Whoever brings the final discipline at home is probably the one who is leading that home. I remember years ago, I was meeting up with local church missionaries that the cult-- some of you guys may be familiar with them, but I was meeting up with them.</p><p>One of the foundations of their teaching is they don't have leaders. We believe in the priesthood of believers. We don't have pastors. Everybody would study, and they would come back, and they would share with each other. We don't have leaders. You guys are unbiblical because you have pastors and elders and leaders, even though the Bible says so.</p><p>But they said, "We don't believe. "We don't have any leaders." I asked them, "If somebody comes into your church, "and they begin to open the Bible, "and they start saying things that are contrary "to what you guys believe, what do you guys do?" And he said, "Well, we have people.</p><p>"I'll stand up and pull them aside, "and we'll make sure that they don't repeat that "in the church." And I said, "So you have somebody designated "that when false doctrines, like according to you, "is being spread in that church, "they'll stand up and say you are not allowed to do that "and kick them out of the church?" And he says, "Yes." They're your leaders.</p><p>Those people that you've designated in your church to make sure that false doctrines are coming in, they're your leaders. You can call them whatever you want, but the one who brings the discipline is the one who is leading that home. In Proverbs 3, 11-12, it says, "My son, do not reject this discipline of the Lord "or loathe his reproof.</p><p>"For whom the Lord loves, he reproves, "even as Father corrects the son in whom he delights." He doesn't say, "Fathers, you have to discipline." But he assumes that. Hebrews 12, 7, "It is for discipline that you endure. "God deals with you as with sons. "For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?" It's given.</p><p>That's the role of the father. Colossians 3, 21, "Fathers, do not exasperate your children "so that they will not lose heart." In your discipline, make sure that you are tempered, that you're not just giving full vent to your anger, but it's given, that that responsibility has given to the father.</p><p>Thirdly, fathers are the providers of the family. Fathers are the providers of the family. Now, again, let me repeat. This doesn't mean the Bible says that women can't work and you can't do this, you can't do that, that if you're going to follow Jesus Christ, you need to stay home and you can't have a job.</p><p>The Bible does not describe that. But the Bible does describe that responsibility is on the shoulder of the man of that house. In 1 Timothy 5, 7, "But if anyone does not provide for his own, "and especially for those of his own household, "he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever." He's talking to men.</p><p>He's talking to men. That responsibility is on the shoulders of the men. Matthew 7, 9-11, even the way he describes prayer. "Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for love, "will give him a stone? "If he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?</p><p>"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, "how much more will your Father who is in heaven "give what is good to those who ask him?" This is such a difficult thing in our generation because the understanding of fatherhood has been so watered down.</p><p>It almost seems sinful to say, "Be a man and do this." Now, many of us, especially those of you who are older, came from immigrant families. And because we came from immigrant families, our fathers were not able to make enough money, so many of us, we're called latchkey kids because our parents were not around.</p><p>And they were put into that situation because that was the only way for them to survive. And so they had to do what they needed to do. So the Bible is not prescribing and saying, "This is the only way that you're going to take care of your family." But at the same time, the Bible makes it very clear that responsibility, that weight is on our shoulders.</p><p>You know, I see in our generation more and more people because they want to live a certain lifestyle, which was a term created by rich people. Lifestyle, style. You're going to have a style, a certain style of life you're going to have, right? Completely unbiblical. Either you are living or you are dead.</p><p>But the idea of lifestyle is certain things that are added to your life. I'm going to live by this style. I'm going to live by this standard. And so in order to have this lifestyle, I need to do this and this and this and this. And oftentimes, who we end up forfeiting is our own children to have a certain lifestyle.</p><p>I remember early on--and again, I never went to father's school. I come from an immigrant family where my parents were busy with ministry. So my parents were not around much. So I remember the first time I became a father, I was scared to death because they gave me a baby that's life.</p><p>And I remember thinking, like, I break everything. My dad would always say, like, "Peter, you're too rough." And anything that's in my hand, eventually--I'm just curious. I want to break it apart and see what's inside. Or sometimes I play with it too rough and it would break. And I remember they would give me my firstborn, and I remember taking him home thinking, "Oh, my God, I'm going to break him too." Are they serious?</p><p>Do they know who I am? I remember early on thinking, "I'm going to be the best father that I know how to be," which I did not know. I didn't know what that meant, but I want to try. So I remember early on--and some of you guys who know, I just don't spend money.</p><p>I don't have habits where I have to go buy stuff. But I spent $800 on Hanna-Barbera Bible stories. $800 for me. My full-time pay at that time was $1,300. $800 was a lot of money. But I bought it because I wanted to make sure that I prepare so my children, when they're old enough--and this is right after we got married.</p><p>I didn't even have kids yet. So I bought that, and it was on our shelf. And by the time my kids were old enough to watch it, it became lame already. So all this computer stuff came out, and Hanna-Barbera--it felt like it was 20, 30 years old. So more than half of it we never even opened.</p><p>I ended up just donating it to somebody. But I was determined. I'm going to be a good father. I didn't know what that meant, but I want to be a good father. Early on, because we were having financial problems, my wife was working, and we had Jeremy at daycare because I had to do ministry, and then Esther had to work.</p><p>But early on, before she went in, I asked her because she got accepted to a pharmacy school, and I asked her to change her major. And the reason why--because I wanted her to run with me. So at that time, I was speaking in a lot of churches, and during the summertime, we would go to retreats, and so if you have that job, you're not going to be able to come.</p><p>So maybe if you became a schoolteacher, that you would have summer breaks, and then you'll be a little bit more flexible, and you can come with me. That was one reason. But the second reason was because I was making so little money, if she became a pharmacist, she would be making four times what I was making at that time, and I was afraid.</p><p>I was afraid that if she makes that kind of money, and I am making four times less, and we get used to that lifestyle, that if we ever wanted to ask her to stay home, I'm not going to be able to. How are we going to go from making what she's making, being used to having that kind of money, and then all of a sudden, we're going to get rid of two-thirds of our income, and then we're going to live here?</p><p>So from the get-go, in order to prevent that temptation, I asked her not to go into that field. Eventually, even though as a schoolteacher, she was still making double what I was making as a schoolteacher, eventually I asked her to stay home, and the reason why I asked her to stay home was Jeremy was going to daycare and coming back sick all the time, and I'm tired after doing ministry.</p><p>She's tired, and from four or five o'clock until he slept, there was just no peace at home. And so I remember, and again, this is not because I was convicted about, you know, you can't work or any of that. It was just practically that there's no peace at home because my kids are going to be like constantly, and they're away from us, and when they are together, we don't want to use that three, four hours with them to discipline them, and then send them back to school the next day.</p><p>So it was more of a practical decision that even though I'm going to be losing my health coverage and all that stuff, I'd rather have peace at home, and I'm going to, even if I have to get a second job, I'd rather get a second job, and I'm huffing and puffing, but at least my kids and my wife will be taken care of, and they'll be there with peace at home.</p><p>So practical reason. As difficult as that was, it was the best decision that I made. As difficult as that, and yes, we had financial problems. It was difficult. There were periods when I couldn't even ask her to go buy grocery. Now, I share all of this, not because I did everything perfectly, but this temptation to live a certain lifestyle, this lifestyle that we have planted ourselves in, that we will not compromise in.</p><p>If there's anything that you should not compromise is your children, not your lifestyle. So again, I'm not saying that there's a certain path that everybody needs to go to, but that responsibility for the husband, for the father, it's on our shoulders. We don't share that burden with our wives.</p><p>We don't come home and say, "You know what? It's too hard for me, so you should do it too." Now, you may be in a situation where that may be necessary, but that responsibility is on us. It's on us to take care of our home. And so the responsibility of the father is to create a place where the wife can be the best wife that she can be, so that she can be the best mother that she can be.</p><p>That responsibility is on the shoulder of the father. I know that's difficult, and I have not done a perfect job in that myself. But today, as men are being deliberately neutered in our culture, if there's any time in history where men need to act like men, it's today. We need to take responsibility of our own homes and shoulder that ourselves.</p><p>Again, early on, when we didn't have a lot of money, ESSER did a far greater job balancing our checkbooks. Some of you guys have no idea what that means. A long time ago, before computer, we had to wait for the bank statement to come, and then you'd keep record of what you spent, and then you would reconcile with what the bank says that you spent.</p><p>And so once a month, you would have to take the bank statement and reconcile it. Now, I am not good with details. So whenever I do it, it just never comes out the way it should. I'm always missing two, three hundred bucks, or next time I do it, it's like, "Oh, we're rich." Not because we really are, because I'm just not good at keeping records.</p><p>So ESSER was good at that. But there was a stretch in our early days in marriage where I wasn't getting paid from church, because the church was having a struggle. And I'm not talking about this church, but the previous church I was at. So there were stretches, and I remember one year, there was about four or five months that I didn't get paid at all, zero.</p><p>So I was going out washing cars and doing whatever I needed to to pay bills, but I remember coming home one day, and ESSER was sitting on the bed crying because she was so anxious that we didn't have money. And so I came and I saw her a couple times, and after that I said, "You know what?</p><p>This is not your responsibility." So I took that away from her, even though I knew I'm going to be losing some money, you know what I mean? Because I'm not good at keeping records. But when that pressure of finance comes, I need to take that responsibility. I don't want her to think, "I've got to get another job.</p><p>I've got to go do this." I need to do that. So I took that on so that when I felt like that we're going to be short of money, so that I can go pass out flyers and wash cars and cut grass, whatever I needed to do, so that she can be home and give full attention to our family.</p><p>That responsibility is on my shoulder. It is on your shoulder as men. Again, I'm going to say, because I know somebody in this room is going to say, "Oh, this guy's legalistic. He's telling us that women need to stay home barefoot and pregnant." I'm not saying that. I never said that.</p><p>What I am saying, principally, that's the men's responsibility. That the pressure is put on men. That if the men don't take that responsibility, we're not leaders. We're not leaders. You can't be a leader simply because the Bible says that God's given you this title. You're a leader because you're leading, because you're up in the front.</p><p>You're the one taking the bullets. You're the one who is willing to go out and get your hands dirty, stay up late, get the second job, and coming home huffing and puffing. We live in a culture where you're taught since you're young, "Follow your dreams." That's bogus. "Follow your dreams" is just another way of saying, "Give into your flesh." Whatever your flesh desires, follow it.</p><p>That's not Christian. For men, we don't look for careers that make me feel happy. We choose careers that are going to help me to take care of my family. Not what fulfills me. What fulfills me is to see my children taken care of. What fulfills me is my family being taken care of.</p><p>Not that during this 9 to 5, I'm happy. My happiness doesn't come from my own flesh. Follow your dreams is not biblical. Follow God's dreams. His desire, He says, "We are hidden in Christ." When He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him. But while we're here, God has placed that responsibility on the shoulders of men.</p><p>Fourth and finally, the primary call of the Father is redemption. Primary call of the Father is redemption. Says Psalm 103.13, "Just as the Father has compassion on His children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him." And the imagery that Jesus gives of Him pursuing sinners is the prodigal son.</p><p>And the Father patiently waits for the son to return. And so the imagery that He gives of redemption is of Father and Son. The primary call of a father is to bring salvation to the home. That's his primary call. And that's why he says in John 10.10-16, Jesus says, "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.</p><p>I came that they may have life and have it abundantly." How is He going to do that? He says in verse 11, "I am the good shepherd." The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</p><p>He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own. My own knows me. He said that responsibility to take care of your children in your home is the responsibility of the Father. And if you hand that over to anybody else, when danger comes and hardship comes, they are going to be going to self-survival mode, and your children are not going to be taken care of.</p><p>He says the call of the Father, the good shepherd, is to lay down His life for the sheep. That's what we've been called to, to lay down our life for our sheep. Every father, your sheep is your children, your own family. And so we are here. God has called us to lead by laying down our life.</p><p>Isn't that what He says about relationship between husband and wife in Ephesians 5, 22 and on? That as Christ gave His life to wash and regenerate the wife, He said that's what's been given to our fathers, to lay down our life. And if you hand that responsibility to anybody else, when danger comes, they will flee, and your family will not be safe.</p><p>And He goes on to say, "I have other sheep which are not in the fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice, and they will become one flock with one shepherd." Now let me conclude with this. I had a conversation with a young father recently, and they were away, and I don't want to mention his name because I don't want to embarrass him, but I was so encouraged by the conversation because they were away, back in another country in their hometown, and in the months that they were there, he said they were wrestling, him and his wife were wrestling, because it's a much easier place to live.</p><p>They have relatives there to take care of their children. The government is a lot more conservative. In fact, in their public school, they would have an option to have Christian education, in public school. So they said in every way, it's a much easier life, it's a slow pace of life, and their lifestyle would be much better over there.</p><p>But during the whole time, they wrestled with finding a good church to go to. And so he said that they were going back and forth, and at the end, the reason why they made that decision is because they wanted their children to be raised at Berean. And he said the reason why--not to say that Berean is the only church, but because they had such a hard time finding a church, he said the reason why they came is so even though they may have a much easier, physically protected, more comfortable life over there, I'd rather put my children in a situation where they will hear the gospel and be safe.</p><p>Their salvation is more important than anything else that they may be able to provide over there. And I was so encouraged by that because our church is filled with young families. I wish I had better instruction when I was younger so that I wouldn't have bought Hanna-Barbera. You know, there's a lot of other decisions that I made.</p><p>When I look back at the years, and I wish--there are certain things that I did differently. None of my regret has to do with finance, even though we had some hardships in finance. Everything that I regret has to do with my children. That I wish I spent more time with them.</p><p>And it wasn't because I wasn't around. I was just so busy with church. And, you know, yesterday we celebrated Father's Day and my kids took me out. So they're all older and they have some money now. Now they actually can pay for dinner and they got me a nice iPad, you know, which was fantastic, you know.</p><p>I'm going to use and take to Korea. But to be honest, the best gift that I will remember from yesterday was we got a long extended time to spend together, you know. And we had dinner together, then we went and got some yogurt land. And to be honest, I don't know if they were antsy to get out because it's so hard to get the older children to come.</p><p>They all have jobs and they have their own friends and all this stuff. So it's hard. We have to make an appointment with them to have family dinner. And it just happens that both of my older children's girlfriends were not in town, so they had more time. So we're just sticking around, we're just, you know.</p><p>And then we go--nothing special, we're just kind of sitting around. And so we were able to spend hours together, which is so rare, you know. But that's what made me happy more than anything else, that I was able to spend that kind of time with my children. And if there's any regret, I wish they were smaller when they didn't drive and they were stuck with me, and so I could have that kind of time with them.</p><p>And I remember when I was in India, I had a dream that my second son, Isaiah-- I don't know why, but he came out as a 3-year-old in my dream in India. I have better dreams in India for some reason. And I remember being so happy that he was with me.</p><p>I remember just holding him, just walking around, just having silly talk with him and just thinking, like, "Oh, I get to experience this again with my kid." And I woke up and was like, "Oh, it was a dream." But the dream was so real. The dream was so real, I was like, "Oh." I felt it emotionally, I was able to experience that again.</p><p>But, you know, those years have passed many, many years. When we're young parents, we get so caught up in the next stage, eager to have our kids there and then move on to the next. And then once you get there, you live the rest of your life regretting. I wish I was more present and understood how time flies.</p><p>And so all the priorities that we had when we were younger gets flipped upside down, thinking I would give up so much if I could just have the kids in my home again. That responsibility, especially to young men, is on our shoulder, to be good fathers, to be good men, so that our boys would also grow up to be good men and good fathers.</p><p>Do not allow the pressure that's coming from our culture to dictate your priorities at this stage of life. Let the Word of God richly indwell in you that we do not follow the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind. So as we celebrate Father's Day today, and I know that some of you may be older, and there's a lot of things that you regret in life, but God is gracious.</p><p>None of this is so that we can feel ashamed. All of this is so that the next generation of people, that we would stand firm as Joshua did, that no matter what is happening around there, for me and my household, we will serve the Lord. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing, for your guidance.</p><p>Lord, we know the burden that the men in our church have on our shoulders. Help us, Lord God, not to flee from it, not to pass it on, but help us, Lord God, to act like men, to take up that burden for the sake of our wives and our children, that they would be blessed as you blessed us, that they would know you as you drew near to us.</p><p>And so I pray, especially now, Lord God, as our school systems, or even our government is actively practicing and pushing laws, Lord God, that is contrary to your laws, help us, Lord God, as a church, and particularly as men and fathers, to stand firm, that we would stand, Lord God, to fight this good fight, that our homes, Lord, that there would be no question, is a place where we have committed to follow Christ.</p><p>And for that end, we pray for your blessing and strength. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Let's all stand up for the closing praise. I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way. The sin that promised joy and light had led me to the grave.</p><p>I had no hope that you would all arrive all to your will. And if you have not loved me first, I would refuse you still. But as I ran, my help arose, different to the cost. You looked upon my helplessness and led me to the cross. And I beheld God's bloodless flame.</p><p>You suffered in my place. You poured out, you served for me. Now all I know is grace. Alleluia. All I have is Christ. Alleluia. Jesus is my life. Alleluia. All I have is Christ. Alleluia. Jesus is my life. Now Lord, I would be yours alone. And if so all might see, the strength to follow your commands could never come from me.</p><p>Oh Father, you, my ransom, I, in any way you should. Let my song forever be my only constant issue. Alleluia. All I have is Christ. Alleluia. Jesus is my life. Alleluia. All I have is Christ. Alleluia. Jesus is my life. Alleluia. All I have is Christ. Alleluia. Jesus is my life.</p><p>Pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, you know our weaknesses, you know our fear, you know our mistakes, you know our regrets. Help us, Lord God, that your grace would be sufficient. It would be sufficient, Lord, for us not to look behind. It would be sufficient, Lord God, that we may run the race with perseverance today.</p><p>That it would be sufficient to keep us hoping and striving after righteousness as you have placed before us. I pray, Father God, especially now as we celebrate Father's Day, to establish the men in our church, Lord God, to be the strength, to be the leaders in our home. That as the world is attacking manhood, families, I pray, Father God, that we would stand strong against the tide.</p><p>That we would be a brighter light than ever in this dark world. As you warned us, as evil is increasing, that love of many will grow cold. Help us, Lord God, not to fall into that temptation. Help us not to make a goal to win in this rat race, but to live as sojourners who are simply passing through.</p><p>That we would simply be a greater and greater light and the aroma of Christ wherever you send us. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. They called Him Jesus He came to us Healed and forgave He lived and died To buy my pardon An empty grave is there to prove My Savior lives Because He lives I can face tomorrow Because He lives All fear is gone Because I know He holds the future And life is worth the living Just because He lives  Fearful weight of true obedience It was sent by Him alone One wondrous faith to bear the cross</p></div></body></html>
