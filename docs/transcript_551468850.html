I'm currently a third year public health science at UCI and this is my testimony. So unlike many of my peers, I never grew up in a church, nor did I grow up in a Christian household. The earliest memory I have of church was attending it with my grandparents here and there when I was younger. But after entering elementary school, I stopped going. Growing up, I was what you called a good kid. Never got in trouble by my teachers, obeyed my two loving and caring parents, didn't attend parties or intake alcohol or drugs, had a close group of friends that all got along well with each other, anything the world would see as ideal. However, in my senior year of high school, I began to be involved in different dating relationships. Even though I had all that I could ask for, I still felt a void in my heart and struggled at finding my purpose and identity. Although my closest friend introduced me to her home church in senior year, I was still confused at who God was and who I was. My struggle at trying to please man, especially my boyfriends, and deem worthy to those around me. I tried filling the void with dating relationships in school, but because of that, it brought upon a lot of scars and pains. Coming into university, I never planned on being involved with church or Christ. I wanted to indulge in the world by attending parties and seeking freedom now that I was away from my family. However, in his grace, God had other plans for me. I was introduced to Berean Community Church by alumni from my high school. Many of you may know him as Eugene. I was drawn in by how welcoming the community was and the passion Pastor Peter had for the word. Before I realized, I was involved in small group, Friday Bible study, Sunday service, and campus ministry. I heard the gospel for the first time during small group my freshman year of college. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life, John 3:16. Through church, small group, and campus ministry, I was beginning to understand who God was and the consequences of sin. My faith wasn't tested until I was away from church for the summer my freshman year. By experiencing various trials, I saw that my knowledge of the Lord was all head and no heart. I tried to convert those around me into Christianity and change their hearts through my own works and actions but was only faced with constant criticism and rejection. I began to question my salvation and faith in the Lord. One day I shut myself in a closet and for the first time prayed vulnerably and honestly to the Lord. I surrendered my everything to him and truly declared him as my Lord and Savior. An overwhelming sense of peace flooded in my heart as I knew that no work or worth could ever earn his love. Someone so insignificant and sinful as myself is deeply known and deeply loved by the Lord my Father. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God put forward as appropriation by his blood to be received by faith, Romans 3, 23 to 25. God continues to write my story. I am far from perfect and I struggle with sin daily but I know that he is working in me and renewing me. I am blessed to be surrounded by communities of brothers and sisters that encourage and sharpen me and as Pastor Nate likes to say, "Once saved, always persevere." I am no longer a slave to that through sin but redeemed and adopted into his kingdom. Truly this life is no longer mine to live but Christ who lives in me. Thank you.   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 you you you you you you</p></div></body></html>
