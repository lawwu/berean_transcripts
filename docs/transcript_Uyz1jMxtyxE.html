We're just gonna go ahead and start off the night with a time of worship.                              Hello everyone. Welcome again to Passion Week devotions. This is something we've been doing for years now. And Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we've been giving these devotions to help us see how Jesus walked the last days before crucifixion. Something I wanted to remind us of also is as we see how Jesus intentionally takes each of these days towards the cross, it causes us to feel and see the richness of what led to that death and what leads to the resurrection. And our hope is that we would all be able to feel and sense the depths of that so that even the depths of our worship would grow. And today as we spend time going through this together, I hope we're also all very encouraged. I know someone I talked to recently said, "Oh man, it's so nice to be able to be here just on these days of the week. It's nice to be together to worship even though it's just a short hour." And in that, it would encourage us and spur us on towards greater worship of Christ. After our prayer set here, we're going to be having our brother Mark come up to give his testimony of how he became a saved person. And after that, we'll be going into a silent Wednesday. Let me go ahead and pray for us. Heavenly Father, we come here, God, remembering that though perhaps we've thought of your march, of Jesus' march to the cross time and time again, Lord, that this is a fresh privilege and opportunity. God, to remember anew what it is that Christ did to purchase salvation for us. God, he didn't just die. There was so much he had to endure. So much that our Lord and Savior had to go through. And Father, we don't want to take this flippantly. We want to remember him. God, we want to thank you for each of these days, for each story we go into, for each account in these Gospels. God, we want to remember it and never forget it. We do not want the Gospel to grow stale in our lives. And so Lord, tonight we come in humble adoration, but also in humble submission. Lord, coming with empty hands, asking you, Father, to break our hearts. Remind us, Lord. Remind us of what you did. Let it be fresh to us. And Lord, let it cause in us a huge worship towards a huge God. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Can we all stand for a time of worship? Amen.  Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall, There is still one King reigning over all. So I will not fear, for this truth remains, That my God is the Ancient of Days. None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand. For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the Ancient of Days. Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul, He is here with me. I am not alone, for His love is sure. And He knows my name, for my God is the Ancient of Days. None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand. For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the Ancient of Days.  Though I may not see what the future brings, I will watch and wait for the Savior King. Then my joy complete, standing face to face in the presence of the Ancient of Days. None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hand. For His throne it shall remain and ever stand. All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. For my God is the Ancient of Days. For my God is the Ancient of Days.   All I once held dear, build my life upon. All this world reviews and wars to own. All I once stocked gain, I have counted lost. Spent and worthless now compared to this. Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing. You're my all, you're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.  Now my heart's desire is to know you more, to be found in you and known as yours. Presence by faith what I could not earn, all surpassing gift of righteousness. Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing. You're my all, you're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.  Oh, to know the power of your risen life and to know you in your sufferings. To become like you in your death, my Lord. Oh, with you to live and never die. Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing. You're my all, you're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more. Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing. You're my all, you're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness, and I love you more.  You may be seated. All right. Good evening, church family. My name is Mark Barlas. I'm married to Mel. We have two kids, Amelia and Jack. So I have the privilege of this evening of sharing my testimony, what God has done in my life and what he's doing as of late. And so I've kind of broken up my testimony to hopefully help you guys follow along. And in retrospect, I actually was really blessed by going over it. It just reminds me of God's handiwork in my own life and what he continues to do. And so I begin by presenting the questions that filled my mind throughout high school and college. What did I grow up believing? Is it truth? What is truth? How come I never heard these things about God despite growing up in religious circles? And so my family, growing up, we practiced a type of Catholicism that infused a lot of superstitious beliefs. One such superstition dealt with hand-me-down shoes and wallets accompanied with cash in hopes that the recipient's wealth would multiply tenfold. So you can imagine how much money would come in shoes, for example. And these rituals were understood as, "We just do it because it's always been the way it is." In addition to attending Catholic services, praying the rosary, confessing to a priest, and pursuing good deeds, followed that same logic. That's just how we did it. In them were the false promises of a happy, blessed life here on Earth and a great life in eternity. This would be my paradigm leading up to college. I wish I could say I didn't fall into doing these things, or fail into doing these things, but I did. Eventually, it all became a load too big to carry. Constantly failing to live up to these standards calloused my worldview, cultivating, obviously, teenage rebellion. During middle school, high school period, I saw fractures in what, at that time, I called my faith. Looking back, it was clear that it was man's approval I sought, not the Lord's. Going to Sunday Mass, petitioning prayers to Jesus, Mary, and various saints were soon exchanged with meeting new friends, hanging out, pursuing money, excelling in school, whatever else. I see this was a microcosm of what could have been my life today had not the Lord saved me. At that time, my best life on Earth was my God. The deception was real because it was indoctrinated from the very beginning. Fast-forwarding to my junior year of high school is a period where I really first thought of God's word being planted or sown. To many, junior year, obviously, is a make-or-break year. Academic excellence coupled with extracurricular activities was a surefire way to getting to great colleges. My late-night outings included studying libraries for PSATs, SATs, and whatever AP tests. If my friends and I were not studying, we were joining as many social clubs in an effort to showcase to college recruiters our willingness to go above and beyond. There was one club I joined thinking this is great to have on my college application, and it wouldn't require too much other than regular attendance. My friends encouraged it, and so I went. Lo and behold, it was a Christian club. I thought, "Well, I've been to church all my life. Why not?" This club was evidence, when I look back, of God's providence. The club covered many topics such as Romans Road, the commandments, the fruits of the Spirit, among other things. It was my first time encountering these truths, despite me being confirmed in the Catholic Church that year. I met genuine God-fearing people that are still walking faithfully with the Lord today, and I'm still close friends and grateful for them. That same year, one of them invited me to a Bible study at a church called Maranatha Chapel in San Diego. Their church was going through the book of Hosea, and man, I remember hearing God's Word.  It was preached clearly and differently than what I was accustomed to.  It was refreshing.  A breath of new life?  And for the first time, I thought, "Wow, is this truth?  How is this different from what I grew up with? Isn't this the same?" Later on, I went home that evening, contemplating, and from what I recall, just faint whispers in my head concluded, "This is different." I continued attending the Bible studies, curious where the study would lead. And a few studies later, I bought a Bible. I went to a bookstore, just bought a Bible. Thankfully, it was the right Bible, because I had no idea.  And I started reading. And I remember one of my closest friends mentioned Romans. I was like, "I don't know where it is," so I just started. And I can honestly say God's Word was planted. If I could use emojis back then, it would be the mind-blowing ones.  Because between Hosea and Romans, concepts of God's faithfulness, concepts of no one seeking God, concepts of sin, concepts of grace, all of this perplexed me, but it made sense, a paradox. Despite my inconsistent attendance to Maranatha, every encounter with God's Word challenged and changed my worldview. I began learning more about who God is-- holy, righteous, faithful, gracious, merciful, loving, the list goes on. His Word exposed my sins of selfish ambition and man's approval. Like an onion, the layers of my sin were being peeled back, revealing my core nature, sinful. Yet I was not willing to surrender. So I wandered with a rebellious heart my first two years of college, thinking there was still a space to have what I wanted. I eventually entered UC Irvine as a junior and reconnected with old friends and made new ones. These same friends eventually brought me here to Berean. Faithful pastors and brothers here walked me through and back to the Word. It confirmed its validity patiently. Books such as Philippians, Romans, Matthew, Ephesians reiterated the insufficiency of my morality ambitions. These things did not save me but condemned me. I was a fool thinking I could have the world and obtain eternal life based on my moral excellence. God really opened my eyes that year. Emojis again. It was clear I was a sinner before a thrice holy God, deserving of His righteous judgment. For the first time I was scared but not. For the first time my heart and heart was being broken, but a new heart was taking shape. Psalm 824 spoke truth that forever would change my life, but God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ. And just a few verses down provided the clarity that eventually I believed in. By grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing. It is a gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. It was clear, Christ alone, faith alone. Just a few months later I confidently declared Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior and was baptized. The sweetness of understanding God's salvation plan transformed me in ways where family and friends noticed immediately, asking what happened, why, are you sure? Some saying that this is just a phase, it will pass. Well, it's been 15 years since that time. Praise God that He remains. The author and perfecter of my faith. And since then, my family has been the one of the ministries God's placed in my life. Sorry. It's been challenging and heartbreaking on multiple fronts. Obviously I can't share this evening, but in these moments of sanctification where I wrestle with surrender, discernment, obedience, God has faithfully pointed me back to His word, to who He is, His promises, His kingdom. Back to the foot of the cross, humbled. And something I've been meditating on, Philippians 2, 4, 7, and which I'll conclude with, rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Thank you.  Thanks, Mark. There's proof that real men cry. And I'm so thankful for Mark. He's one of our college staff. As he was going through that testimony, I realized there's so many people pouring into his life, into the entirety of it. And now here he is pouring right back into our students as well. And I can't help but marvel. It's hard not to marvel, you know, that what Jesus did as we keep trekking with Him in this story was not just some story 2,000 years ago, but it has present-day ramification for us every single day. That all of that was necessary for Mark to be saved, for me to be saved, and for all of us that call ourselves believers. I'm very thankful. May we read for us Luke 22, verses 1-6. Luke 22, verses 1-6.  Let's pray. Lord, as we go into silent Wednesday this day, where there might not have been so much activity in the life of Christ as written, Lord, we can see how much you move. And Father, as we see this on display, I pray, Lord, that as we can even remember every single one of our testimonies, God, that what Christ did on the way to that cross was vital for us as individuals as well as a body. And Lord, we just sing a song that says that knowing you, there is no other thing. We say, "You're my all. You're the best." We say, "To live is Christ." And so, God, I pray that our hearts would trek along with what we sing. God, that as we see Jesus on the way to this cross, Lord, that we wouldn't be trying to fit that story into our lives. But Lord, that that would be the center. God, that we can see how our lives shed light on what he did there. That Jesus would be the center of every single one of us. And Father, that this story would shine. Help us, Lord, because we are so self-centered a people. We need your grace in order to properly worship you tonight. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. On day one this past Sunday, Pastor Peter took us through Palm Sunday where many were singing Hosanna. And I thought it was really powerful what Pastor Peter kind of ended with, that Jesus grieves. On day two this past Monday, Jesus cursed the fig tree. He cleared and cleansed the temple. Yesterday on day three, Jesus pronounces the woes on the Jewish leaders and he tells them to be aware of the future, to be ready for what's coming. Today, this is day four, this is Wednesday. Wednesday in Scripture, some people call it Silent Wednesday because the Gospels are relatively silent about Jesus' activity on this day. But something that we see is Judas. Judas Iscariot, and he's very active. This is a day before the Passover. And the Passover meal, I'm really excited for that tomorrow. But I realized then we can't really go into what happened on Passover. I'm hoping one day we can actually do that for a devotion. But this is the day before the Last Supper when Jesus and the disciples would sit down in front of the bread and the wine, and they would take of that together. Now I want to read to you again what we just read in Luke 22 and to try your best to walk along with Jesus here, or the story of Jesus here that's unraveling. Luke 22 verse 1, I'm going to read it again. "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death, for they were afraid of the people. And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve, and he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them." And I want to focus in here on the parties that are involved. So either you can look down at the text, you can look up here, but look and see the detail that Luke is putting in. First, you see the religious leaders who are conspiring against Jesus to kill him. In verse 2, "The chief priests and the scribes were seeking." That word "seeking" is pretty heavy. They were seeking, intentional, willful, trying to figure out how can we put this man to death. But secondly, we see also Satan at work here, who enters into Judas. Satan's been at work since the beginning. Satan's been at work trying to figure out how to prevent the Messiah from coming, and when the Messiah comes into the picture, how to crush him. But thirdly, and perhaps most heartbreaking, in verse 3, "And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot." Judas Iscariot was conspiring to have Jesus killed. Now there's so much intention. If there's any word that I'd like us to take away tonight is "intention," because I think that's what Luke is describing. He's describing intention. That the chief priests and the scribes were being intentional and willful. Satan was being intentional and willful. Judas was being intentional and willful. In fact, Luke is very careful here to mention that Judas belongs to the twelve. You see that? Belonging to the number of the twelve. Why would he mention a fact like that? To emphasize the fact that Judas was a part of Jesus' inner circle. Judas intentionally, willfully, even as one who's been walking with Jesus these last three years, he goes to the chief priests and officers and discusses with those men who are trying to intentionally kill Jesus, how he might betray Jesus to them. This is planned and thought out action. In the account of Matthew, it records Judas' actual words to these leaders. Let's look at it. Matthew 26, verse 15. I mean, this is so malicious. He goes up to the chief priests and scribes and he says, "What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?" Isn't this so heartbreaking? He goes to them and he says, "What will you give me for me to betray him so that you can kill him?" Wow. We learn in this account of Matthew that 30 pieces of silver is all it took. 30 pieces of silver. Some people say that 30 pieces of silver was what it costed to purchase a slave. It's shocking that someone so close to Jesus, someone who walked with Jesus, who saw Jesus' works and miracles, he was in the inner circle. He was as close as you could get to Jesus. He witnessed his power firsthand. He saw Jesus' grace and compassion and mercy upon people. He saw Jesus' power. He saw Jesus cast out demons and rebuke disease. And he actively goes and betrays his Lord. Satan enters, yes, but this is still him. This was still the responsibility and action of this man, Judas. Judas doesn't just give in to a moment of weakness. He calculates, and after hearing everything it is to enter into the kingdom, after witnessing all it is that the Holy Spirit was at work, Judas becomes the one to knock that very first domino down, and he paves the way for sinful man to nail Jesus to the cross and crucifixion. Now, I want to remind us of last night. Judas just heard. He just heard Jesus pronounce these woes and rebukes upon the leaders of Israel, right? And he said, "Hypocrites!" It was a damning preaching. It was fiery and powerful. He says, "These men will not enter the kingdom of God." He heard it. And yet, Judas goes right to those leaders on this day. Wow. It's amazing that Judas doesn't hear. It's amazing that in that place his heart had become so hardened that he wouldn't fall in repentance and turn away. He actually doubled down. That's how sin works. This is what we see in him. Now, though there's not action in regards to Jesus, what I do want to take a moment is to see what might have been going on in the mind of Jesus on this day. This is, remember, the last week Jesus walks this earth. Before, it's not just death. It's so much more, isn't it? Before he faces the wrath of God, an eternal wrath of God. I mean, this is--have you ever been so anxious about something? Like so anxious about something? Like what happens to your concentration? It consumes you, doesn't it? When you're so scared of a test coming up, or you're so scared of something that you're going to have to do, or you're so scared of this thing that's looming, it consumes you. You can't sleep. You're just thinking about it all the time. Things might be going on all around you. People are walking around all around you. You can't think about them. You are so consumed. This is the last week of Jesus before he takes the cup of wrath. What was going on in the mind of Jesus? I mean, what must have it been like for Jesus to know that betrayal, this betrayal that was to come towards him, not just from Judas but from all sinners. What must have been like as Jesus was seeing this happen all around him, that yet he was going to take the sin of all of the hostility that was coming out from these people. I sometimes wonder what it must have been like for Jesus, who is the holy God, to walk amongst these people, to not only be pronouncing woes to the scribes and Pharisees over there who are trying to kill him, but even in his inner circle to see vile, depraved sin at work. That it wasn't just far, it was near. What must it have been like for Jesus to see that this sin was just so pervasive? And he was just seeing all of this going around. That it was Judas, that it was these people, that it was Satan, everything. I mean, Jesus doesn't use this last week to think about himself. He doesn't use this last week to realize what's going on and the sin that's going on all around him. He knows what's happening. He feels it. There is nothing good around him. He is the only holy one who is walking around. The entire planet. Everything else is broken. Everything else is vile. Everything else is fallen. It's just filth all around him. And he is walking around thinking of others. He must have known what Judas was doing on that day. And he took no action to protect himself. He took no action to become inward or to cloister or to think that this is a time I can just go and see if I can be selfish here. In fact, again, I can't go too much into this because this is tomorrow. This is the Passover meal. But the very next day, during the Passover meal, Jesus washes the disciples' feet. Including Judas's. What must have it been like for the holy God, the only holy one, with vile and righteousness and depravity all around him, to kneel down and wash the filthy feet of filthy sinners? What must have it been like for him to go in front of Judas, the one who was to betray him, and do the same? I think this account reminds us of a couple of things. First, there is threat. There is a lot of fear to be had in this story. Because I think we need to take care of where we stand. Because what we see in Judas here is that nearness to Christ, and nearness to the things of Christ, does not guarantee that you know Christ. It does not guarantee our salvation, let alone our devotion. It shows us that we need to take stock of our own lives and evaluate our hearts, and see where there is not only a heart of unbelief, but perhaps even what we see in Judas, a purposeful rebellion. A purposeful resistance, and even hatred against God. As we all have a bit of this Judas inside of us. And some sitting amongst us are Matthew 7, 21 people, who will one day come before God as Judas perhaps might have. Perhaps Judas heard these words. Perhaps these were his last-ditch things, even though he knew. He comes and he said, "But maybe, even though I betrayed Jesus, that I would come before God and say, 'But didn't I do all these things in His name? Didn't I do all these things in Your name, Jesus? I know, but does Your cross, does Your blood, does Your grace not cover over all sin? Didn't I do all those things?'" And Jesus would have stared at Judas and said, "I never knew you, but there are those who are sitting amongst us that perhaps would sit in the same place. So we ought to take care of where we stand." But I think in this story there's also good news because Judas' story has closed, but ours are still open. You still have opportunity today to turn and to repent. You don't need to meet the same end as Judas. And this week is all about, I hope you have the opportunity every single night this week to repent and turn to the Lord because that's what we see in this story. Secondly, there's hope and grace and love in this story. We ought to remember how great the love of Christ was in His sacrifice on the cross. No one was with Him. Remember, these religious leaders were against Him. And by the end, the people were shouting out and screaming out, "Crucify Him." They were even desiring Jesus to die over a high-profile murderer. His disciples had scattered, deserting Him in the time of His greatest need. And most terrifying of all, the Father Himself unleashed all the pent-up fury and wrath over sin. What we see in the midst of the only Holy One who is walking around all these vile, wretched sinners, even to the point where everyone is not just vile and wretched and living out their own lives, but breathing hostility against this Jesus, that they might crucify Him, that we see the love and the grace that might enact in us hope. Jesus didn't die for good people. He died for the wretched. And if we are believers, we are numbered amongst these. I want to turn our attention to John 13, verse 1. And this is the John take on what was going on with Judas. Because right after this, we see what he says about Judas. In John 13, verse 1, it says, "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come, that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end." Again, please, please look carefully. Please don't let these words just go past. I know sometimes we have a tendency to look at Scripture, and then you wait for what the preacher has to say about it. Look at the words. It says, "Jesus, knowing that His hour had come, that He would depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end." It shows us the heart of Jesus, which is just crazy to me. That as He's walking around, as much as we see the vileness and the wretchedness of the sinners that are walking all around Him, that Jesus was filled with a heart of love. It's a story about Judas and these chief scribes and these Pharisees, these religious leaders, perhaps about Satan who's at work. But what we see in this story is actually to paint for us, not a picture of us looking at the story and being like, "Man, they're pretty bad." This story is actually supposed to show us in this narrative of Christ who's walking towards the cross that we are numbered amongst them. That we are just as depraved, that we are just as vile, and that we were the ones who actually, actively wanted Christ crucified. That as intentional, as willful as they were, that so were we. This is our story. This is us wanting Jesus dead. And so this is Jesus' love for us in the midst of this. On Silent Wednesday, as the entire world was working in conjunction to kill the Lord, we can really see how great sin is and how much greater is the love of God. There is no good in us. There is nothing good in us. So I want to lastly go into this text, which I don't have up here, but would you turn with me to Romans 3?  Chapter 3, verse 10.  "As it is written, 'There is none righteous, not even one. There is none who understands, there is none who seeks for God. All have turned aside, together they have become useless. There is none who does good, there is not even one. Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they keep deceiving. The poison of asps is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their paths. And the path of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes." Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God. Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. And this describes not only Judas, this describes not only the religious leaders, this describes every single one of us. We are counted amongst the mockers. But verse 21, as we look at the cross, "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets. Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. For there is no distinction, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus." Would you take a moment to bow your heads and pray? I feel like there's a few things that need to happen. One thing is we need to see the story of Christ and see everything that is going on. Secondly, that I need to shed light on who we are before Him. And for us as believers, our hearts beat along with this. And I'd like us to pray for maybe two things. One thing, would you pray that God would show us again the vileness and wretchedness of our sin before Him, our holy God? And that counts even to our sin today. Wherever you may stand, whatever it is that you have been fighting with or struggling with or even giving into, that God would show us the vileness as we've seen the story of Judas, that this is crucifixion. Secondly, I pray that we would see the gospel. And would you pray this as well, that God would show us beauty, that God would show us individually what it is to marvel, to respond in worship, to say thank you, and to not just look at our sin and hate the sin, but to look to Christ and see our true desire, to want Him more than anything else, to see all other things fade as shadows. Because though Jesus was silent on this day, we can feel His intention in light of the sinner. Let's take a moment to pray.

And Father, I pray that you would help us to see beauty amidst the depravity. Help us, God, to see that there is only one good amongst the myriads of fallenness and brokenness. That we might not look to other things to cling to, but that there is only one that we can cling to. The only one unshaking good in our lives, our Christ. Oh, Father, there is no other name under heaven by which we're saved. He's all we have. He is our only hope. And so, God, I wanna thank you 'cause even in a testimony shared earlier today, we see tears of joy as we remember what you did. And God, I pray that for each one of us this week, we would remember what you did. That this story is not 2,000 years ago. This story is mine, and it's now. Because it's about my Christ, and it's about the one I love. It's the one who gave his life for me. So thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen. - For our closing praise.

Heavenly Father, I pray that we would not leave as unchanged people. But God, that we would be resolved and be filled with conviction, Lord, to respond. And as we walk out those doors, God, please, let us be moved into transformation and change. That we might desire more of Christ. And that we will want nothing but Christ. So thank you, Lord, for this week. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Okay, well thank you for coming. Again, tomorrow it's gonna be Passover meal, but the logistics team did ask for some help.</p></div></body></html>
