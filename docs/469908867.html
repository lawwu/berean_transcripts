href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=105s">00:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So now they're tied, so next year they'll break it, I'm assuming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=109s">00:01:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, but after every game that happens, and obviously, like, they'll put up the banner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=114s">00:01:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up there, it's the 17th championship banner, and then they'll have the Hall of Famers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=118s">00:01:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">who, jerseys have been retired, and obviously, Kobe's was retired, and then, you know, eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=123s">00:02:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">other people will get retired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=124s">00:02:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why they do that is obviously to venerate, you know, just to kind of honor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=129s">00:02:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that these are the teams that win, won the championship team, and the new people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=133s">00:02:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have come and that they put, retired their jersey and put it up there to inspire people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=137s">00:02:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=138s">00:02:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">When they look up, this is what Lakers is about, this is what you should aspire for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=142s">00:02:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, you can look at that and the new players coming in, maybe get intimidated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=146s">00:02:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and think, "I will never be able to live up to that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=149s">00:02:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, these guys are Hall of Fame basketball players, so it's not assumed that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=154s">00:02:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">every basketball player, in fact, more than 99% of the players that come in and play for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=159s">00:02:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Lakers are not going to have their jerseys retired like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=162s">00:02:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why they do that is not simply to intimidate, but to inspire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=166s">00:02:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're kind of like the Hall of Fame, or, you know, the heroes, basically, of Lakers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=172s">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're a Lakers fan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=173s">00:02:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I say all of this because Chapter 11 is a Hall of Fame for people of faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=179s">00:02:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everything that the author has been saying has been leading up to Chapter 11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=184s">00:03:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that not to drift, but here's some examples of people who live by faith and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=189s">00:03:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">does this faith look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=190s">00:03:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after he does that, starting from Chapter 12, he's going to point back to them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=193s">00:03:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "Considering the cloud of witnesses, this Hall of Fame people who live by faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=199s">00:03:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we ought to follow that example and continue to persevere in our faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=204s">00:03:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So today is the first person in the Hall of Fame, so he's like the first, you know, first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=209s">00:03:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">retired jersey that we're looking at today, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=212s">00:03:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're looking at verse 4, and it starts out of the story between Abel and Kane, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=218s">00:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Abel's offering was acceptable and Kane's offering was not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=225s">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to kind of, before we even jump into it, that we understand what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=231s">00:03:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The story of Kane and Abel is the first generation of people who were born into sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=238s">00:03:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now Adam and Eve were not born into sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=240s">00:04:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They fell because they chose to sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=243s">00:04:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first generation of people, the first fruits of Adam and Eve after they fell was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=248s">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a murderer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=249s">00:04:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is not by accident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=253s">00:04:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The stories that we see in the Old Testament and New Testament are not a collection of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=256s">00:04:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">random things that happen, and just kind of telling us this is what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=261s">00:04:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever we study the Bible, you know, we're doing inductive study of 1 Thessalonians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=266s">00:04:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the key things that we have to constantly ask is, how does this fit into the context?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=271s">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Not

<span class="t">Covenant, but in his redemptive, in the meta-narrative of the Bible, in the redemptive history, where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=283s">00:04:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">does this fit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=284s">00:04:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is this story here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=285s">00:04:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Other than to just tell us that Adam and Eve had children and they ended up, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=291s">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the first one ended up murdering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=293s">00:04:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we're going to see here what he says here is really foundational to our faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=300s">00:05:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What he says in this one verse really sets the table of how we understand the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=307s">00:05:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">redemptive history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=309s">00:05:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully we will be able to unpack that together this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=312s">00:05:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to look at verse 4 again, just verse 4, and then we're going to deal with two things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/469908867#t=318s">00:05:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that he says here this morning.</span></div><div
