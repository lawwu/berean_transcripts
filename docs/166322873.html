class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the foundation of the Gospel. And again, every part of what we are talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is a different element of the Gospel that is being pounded over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=157s">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why this is so essential to our faith. And I think out of all the Bible study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=162s">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">materials that I've ever gone through to lead somebody to Christ, and then once they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=167s">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">become a Christian, like what material do we go through? What are some of the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=171s">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we need to talk about? And I would say probably most of the materials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=175s">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've seen usually goes through assurance of salvation. Whether it's from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=180s">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Navigators or CCC or Southern Baptist or whatever Bible study material, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=185s">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">first things that every group that comes at us, what is the first thing that we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=191s">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that the brand new Christian is assured of is his salvation. So you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through the Gospel message and why we can have assurance. We talked about last week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what is unique about our Christian faith is that we are able to have this assurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=205s">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where John says in 1 John 5, "I write these things to you so that you may know that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=210s">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have eternal life." That we have assurance that when we die we are not rolling the dice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=215s">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">standing before God saying, "Hopefully that I've done enough good. Hopefully that my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=221s">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">good outweigh the bad and then hopefully that we'll be able to get to Heaven." But we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=225s">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are assured by the blood of Christ. And the reason why we are assured, we talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=229s">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">last week, the first of the three points that we talked about, is that it is based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=234s">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">upon His promise and not by our works. So He said, one, why it has to be promised is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=240s">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because we are promised to be heirs of the world. That that's not something that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can add to. You can't just wake up one day and say, "I want to be a child of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=249s">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill Gates." You can't add to that. You can't one day decide by your own will, "I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be a child of God and this is the way I'm going to do it." So the very nature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=260s">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of our salvation requires that it is salvation completely by grace. And then He says, "If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you try in any other way to merit your salvation, it actually nullifies the promise. It is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=275s">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">either by grace or it is by your works. But it can't be both." Thirdly, He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=281s">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Because it is based upon promise, it is absolutely guaranteed." It is guaranteed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=287s">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not contingent upon you. It is not contingent upon your deeds. It is contingent upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=292s">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His promise. And He says, "Because it is by grace that we are guaranteed to have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=298s">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">assurance." If our salvation is by faith and by faith alone, how can we be assured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=306s">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have that faith? How can we be assured that your faith is actually genuine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=312s">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That it's not just wishful thinking? Years ago, there was a movement, and I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">movement is still around today, but there was a movement called the Word Faith Movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way that they described this movement was Name It and Claim It Movement. That same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=330s">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">movement today is called the Health and Wealth Gospel Movement. And basically what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=337s">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">movement teaches is that if you have faith, that faith is able to get you whatever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=343s">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">want. So there was actually a book that I read years ago called The Fifth Dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that book, it basically says that whatever it is that you desire, you want a Lamborghini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=353s">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or you want a beautiful wife or you want to have a million dollars, whatever it is, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=358s">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have enough faith and you put it in an incubator of prayer, so some of the stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=365s">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that you desire requires more incubation time. So you pray longer than other things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=370s">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of the things are not as difficult, so you put it in there, and then it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=376s">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of faith, a little bit of prayer, and then it works. But at the core of what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=382s">00:06:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">movement is, is you have faith in faith. See, the only reason why faith is powerful is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=388s">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of faith itself. It's because of the object of our faith. It is what we have faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=395s">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in. See, if you look at scripture, faith and hope is used almost interchangeably. In Hebrews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=403s">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 11, it says, "Now faith is the assurance of the things hoped for, the conviction of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=409s">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things not seen." What do we hope for? What are the things that you desire? Faith is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=417s">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just some intangible thing that lays in your heart that you can't read. It's deep in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=422s">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Faith is very tangible, because whatever it is that you are hoping for will affect your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=428s">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">decision.

Let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=434s">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">me give you an example. Sometimes, the way we look at faith, the things that we hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=440s">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for, we hope for things that have nothing to do with Christ, and the way that we approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=445s">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ is, Christ is a helper to get us to things that we hope for.

We want to have more money, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=458s">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we think that if we have more money that we're going to have, you know, it's going to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=462s">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our problems. So we come to Christ, hoping that Christ will help us to get more money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=470s">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or sometimes we think our hope is in friendships or relationships. So we come to Christ hoping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=476s">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that Christ will help us to have better relationships. And what we're really hoping for is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=483s">00:08:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">else. And then we're using Christ, hoping that He'll help us to get us to what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=488s">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really hoping for. Does that make sense? But what the Scripture is telling about when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=492s">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have faith is that faith causes us to hope in Christ. That hope is our, Christ is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=499s">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hope. Not just an avenue to get to the hope that we have. And that is why it's extremely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=505s">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">important that we understand why is Abraham the ultimate example of this faith? Why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=513s">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he called the father of faith? Because in verse 18 it says, "In hope he believed against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=519s">00:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hope." Basically, what he was saying is that he had nothing else to hope for. He had nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=525s">00:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">else that he could hold onto, and his only hope was God and God alone. And that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=530s">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">revealed his genuine faith. What was revealed, again, a lot of times you can come to church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=536s">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and where Christ is not your hope, and then you're kind of using Him to get to what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=540s">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really want, and then when God doesn't help you to get to what you're really hoping for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=544s">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're done with Him. You move on to something else. "Well, I prayed to Him, it didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=549s">00:09:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">work. So I'm going to try something else." Well, what we want to look at today is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=556s">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a placebo of faith, just wishful thinking, hoping that if I just do the right thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=563s">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow things are going to go well. We talked about last week, again, the promise, why we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=569s">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">able to have assurance because it's based upon promise. Today we're going to do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=573s">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">other two parts where we're able to have assurance because this covenant that God made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=578s">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was based upon God's power and not man's. Based upon God's power, not man's. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=583s">00:09:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the third and final point is the covenant was based on God's faithfulness and not man's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=588s">00:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at verse 17, the second point. The covenant, meaning the gospel and our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=596s">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation, is based on God's power and not man's. Verse 17, it says, "I have made you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=601s">00:10:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the father of many nations in the presence of the God in whom He believed, who gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=606s">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist." Think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=612s">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the calling of Abraham. Abraham, it says, he believed in God simply because God said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=621s">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I will do it." There's no negotiating. He said, he didn't come before God. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=626s">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, give me about four years. Let me see what you have." God said, "Follow me and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=633s">00:10:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will make you a great nation." He just believed. I mean, it's crazy. It wasn't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=639s">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was homeless and he had no money. Most scholars believe that Moses was probably a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=646s">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rich man already at the War of Chaldeans. I mean, if you look at what he left the War</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=649s">00:10:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of Chaldeans with, he already was a pretty wealthy man. But all God said was, "Leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=656s">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that, pack it up, and go out into the desert where it's dangerous. You might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=660s">00:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually die because of all these bandits and greater nations surrounding you." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=665s">00:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, "The reason why he did that is because he believed. He believed that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=670s">00:11:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is able to bring people from the dead and to create things out of nothing." See, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=678s">00:11:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">himself is the only creator. No human being ever creates anything. All we do is we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=686s">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">creative with creation. Think about the magicians, especially the real good ones. David Blaine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=694s">00:11:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he's actually the only guy I know. But David Blaine, right? Think about these great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=700s">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">magicians and the reason why they make all kinds of money and why even somebody like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=704s">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">me knows his name is because he's good at his trade. He kind of takes crazy stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=711s">00:11:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He takes coins, he throws it out the window, and that coin that was marked goes to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=715s">00:11:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">window and lands on the sidewalk on the other side. Wow, that's crazy. He would take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=721s">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things and they would just boom, it just disappears and he makes it appear. So if you're a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=725s">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">magician, you're good at presenting, you know, basically tricking people. But nobody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=735s">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believes that he actually creates cars. Nobody actually believes that. You'd be crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=740s">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, "Wow, how did you do that?" And when we say, when we ask the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=744s">00:12:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"How did you do that?" We're not saying, "How did you put all the little pieces together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=749s">00:12:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just like that in three seconds?" Right? What kind of trickery did you use? Is it a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=754s">00:12:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mirror? Is it a camera? What is it? Because we understand that only God can create from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=761s">00:12:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. He's the only creator. The theologians call that ex nihilo, out of nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=768s">00:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He creates from nothing. Psalm 33, verse 6, it says, "By the word of the Lord the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=772s">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their hosts." He's the only one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=777s">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who actually creates anything. Psalm 33, 9, "For He spoke and He came to be. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=783s">00:13:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">commanded and it stood firm." Years ago, there was a book called, "Why do bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=790s">00:13:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things happen to good people?" And the Rabbi Kushner tried to answer the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=794s">00:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of why the question of evil in the world. Why is there evil in the world? His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=799s">00:13:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conclusion was twofold. One, either God is not good and He doesn't care. And He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=806s">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually enjoys seeing people suffer. And so maybe that's the reason why there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=811s">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">evil in the world. And again, as a Rabbi, that is unacceptable. How can God be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=816s">00:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">evil? If God was evil, we would all, you know, we'd be all in danger. Like we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=821s">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't be able to survive the next day if that was the case. So he said, "But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=826s">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that may be an answer." But he said, "Obviously, that's not the correct answer."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=829s">00:13:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he gave the second solution. The second solution is God is not powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=834s">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what he was, what he was trying to present as an answer is that all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=840s">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">evil is happening in the world because God does not have control. He doesn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=844s">00:14:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the power to do anything about it. Obviously, it is absolutely unbiblical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=850s">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is absolutely blasphemous to even think that. God who created the universe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=858s">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is absolutely powerful. And that's why in verse 18 when it says, "In hope he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=864s">00:14:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believed against hope." Why? Because in Romans 4.21 he says, "He was fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=870s">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">convinced that God was able to do what He had promised." He's able. Again, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=876s">00:14:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ephesians 3.20, he says, "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=881s">00:14:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all we ask or think according to the power at work within us." He is able.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=887s">00:14:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first and foremost, the thing that everybody wrestles with is, is he able?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=894s">00:14:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can he do it? Can he? And he says clearly the reason why Abraham was able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=902s">00:15:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">leave behind all this thing, walk into danger, is because God was able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=906s">00:15:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fulfill His promise. I can make promises to you. I'm going to make you all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=911s">00:15:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">millionaires. Right? I'm going to make you all millionaires. Now no one's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=915s">00:15:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trust me because you know I don't have that. And you know that I don't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=920s">00:15:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">capability. So I can make all the promises in the world, but if I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=923s">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">able to carry it out, it means absolutely nothing. It means absolutely nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=928s">00:15:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? But he says, first and foremost, God Himself. He can create. He's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=935s">00:15:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">creator. And you're able to have confidence in Him because He's able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=940s">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do all things. Not only is He the creator, He says He is the recreator. He gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=945s">00:15:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">life to the dead.

The Son of God, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1068s">00:17:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a God or a prophet, but He never claimed to be God." And this was when I was I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1072s">00:17:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think a second or third year Bible student at Biola. And so he definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1078s">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">knew the Bible better than I did.

And so I took a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1087s">00:18:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of youth group students out with me.

I went back to school and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1102s">00:18:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talked to my professors and I asked all my professors the questions that came up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1106s">00:18:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had very simple like quick answers.

And this guy was perverting Scripture. But through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1114s">00:18:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">years one of the things that he said was, "Jesus never claimed to be God." And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1118s">00:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">know we can have a whole year coming through Scripture where He does claim to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1123s">00:18:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be God. But one of the greatest things that Jesus says, absolute confirmation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1127s">00:18:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His deity, John 5:21 He says, "For as the Father raises the dead and gives Him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1132s">00:18:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">life, so also the Son gives life to whom He will." Jesus basically said, "As the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1139s">00:18:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Father has the author of life, so does the Son." So if we hear that and say, "Did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1147s">00:19:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually just say that?" See the Jews at that time heard exactly what Jesus was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1152s">00:19:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saying. Right after this, they pick up stones and they try to stone Him. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1157s">00:19:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"We're stoning you not because of the works that you've done. We're stoning you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1161s">00:19:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because you being a mere man claim to be God." He never came out and said, "I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1166s">00:19:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God." But they clearly understood that what He was claiming can only be from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1171s">00:19:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God. Again in John 10, 18, "No one takes it up from Me, but I lay it down of My own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1177s">00:19:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">accord."

Now why is this so important? Because if we don't, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1189s">00:19:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not convinced that He is able, that these are empty promises and all it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1195s">00:19:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is just a placebo, then Christianity is only about this life.

At</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1418s">00:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, you could have all the wealth in the world, but if you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1421s">00:23:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">descendants, it dies with you, right? So, today, you know, we say, oh, you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1427s">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">take it with you, but the way they thought was, well, you can't take it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1430s">00:23:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you, but you can leave it all behind to your descendants, right? So, if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1433s">00:23:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have descendants, all of that would have been it. That's where it would end. So, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1440s">00:24:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believe that his parents probably named him Abram, hoping that all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1444s">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that his maybe father and grandfather accumulated, that all these great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1450s">00:24:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">descendants of Abram will be a beneficiary of this. And that's why they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1455s">00:24:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">named him this. By the time God shows up in his life, he's already 70, and he has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1460s">00:24:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">no children. And his wife is barren. And so, God calls this guy who maybe already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1467s">00:24:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have given up. All his life, Abram, glorified father, great father, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1475s">00:24:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the time God shows up, he probably already has given up. So, imagine, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1479s">00:24:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">know, being called great father with no children. You know, it's almost like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1484s">00:24:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">calling somebody a small stature, big guy. "Hey, big guy." You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1489s">00:24:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost mocking him. Or sometimes you do something really foolish, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1493s">00:24:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they say, "Hey, genius." Right? "Hey, genius." Right? So, it's almost like calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1499s">00:24:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Abram a glorified father, every time he probably heard his name, as a reminder of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1505s">00:25:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the position that he was in. So, God calls him, and he says, "Follow me. I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1510s">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">make your descendants multiply. You can't even count them." So, I think for Abram,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1517s">00:25:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a very personal promise. It wasn't just a kind of generic promise. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1523s">00:25:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something that he's been hoping and praying for. And God said, "If you follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1528s">00:25:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">me." And he just goes out. Right? Because he believed. He believed that he is able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1534s">00:25:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to fulfill this promise. But the thing is, God made this promise, but for the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1540s">00:25:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">25 years. For the first 25 years, it doesn't happen. In fact, it's almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1546s">00:25:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">comical. If you read verse 19, he said, "He did not weaken in faith when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1549s">00:25:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">considered his own body, which was as good as dead." Right? That's pretty harsh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1556s">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's old, but he's not dead yet. But he said, "As good as dead." In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1560s">00:26:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no possible hope for him. Not only is there no hope for him, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1565s">00:26:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he's so old, he's as good as dead. Right? He said, "But since about, he was 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1570s">00:26:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">years old, but also consider his wife. She was also as good as dead. Her womb has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1577s">00:26:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">been closed." And so, God waits until there's absolutely no hope to fulfill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1587s">00:26:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this. And then, that's when he steps in. And if you notice, you know, God names</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1594s">00:26:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">him. Here's a guy, he's like all his life, he's like, "Hey, Abram." You know? What does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1598s">00:26:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he change his name to? "Abraham." And what does the name Abraham mean? "Father of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1604s">00:26:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">multitudes." Right? I mean, it's like, "Hey, genius." And he said, you know, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1610s">00:26:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Einstein." You know what I mean? Like, you're taking a difficult name, and you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1614s">00:26:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">making it impossible now. It's almost mocking. Right? But God tells him, "Your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1621s">00:27:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">name is going to be Abraham, when he has no descendants, and there's no hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1626s">00:27:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatsoever. And then it isn't until there's absolutely no hope, nothing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1632s">00:27:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they can cling to, and God shows up, and he fulfills his promise." Isn't that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1639s">00:27:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly the way God works? In verse 19, he says, "He did not weaken in faith when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1647s">00:27:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">considered his own body." He was just as good as dead. He had absolutely no hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1651s">00:27:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then God comes in, and he gives him a child. Isn't that what the Scripture says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1658s">00:27:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of what he was doing in the Old Testament? Think about Israel's history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1661s">00:27:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why did God give the law? If the law wasn't going to fulfill God's promise of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1666s">00:27:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation, why did He give the law in the first place? He says, "So that the law</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1670s">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">would make sin utterly sinful." Now, I want you to understand the fulfillment of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1675s">00:27:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this in Israel's history. If you look at Israel's history, it's a constant cycle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1679s">00:27:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of rebelling against God, God bringing judgment, they repent, and then God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1685s">00:28:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">restores them. And then when they get restored, they forget God, and then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1689s">00:28:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rebel, God judges them, He forgives them, and then they get restored. It is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1694s">00:28:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">constant cycle, over and over again. But every time that judgment comes and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1699s">00:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get restored, they go back to the same determination, right? Over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1705s">00:28:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"We won't fail you." You know, I know, we learned our lesson. We learned our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1712s">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lesson. And we're not going to do this. I know why the Babylonians came. I know why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1716s">00:28:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Assyrians came. I know why the Midianites came. I know why the Philistines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1720s">00:28:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">came. I know why judgment came over and over and over again. But every time they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1724s">00:28:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get restored, what was their conviction? "We won't fail you." As their whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1730s">00:28:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">history was about their determination to keep the law. And that's the reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1736s">00:28:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Pharisees were so committed to keeping the law. They weren't going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1740s">00:29:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">make the same mistakes as their forefathers. They went into captivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1744s">00:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because they refused to obey the law. They said, "No, we're not going to make that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1747s">00:29:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">same mistake." And that's why they wanted to get rid of Jesus. This guy's telling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1752s">00:29:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">people to not to obey the Sabbath law.

And so each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1771s">00:29:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time, each time they were determined, and each time they fell, sin became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=1776s">00:29:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">utterly sinful, absolutely hopeless.

Wait a second. He just prayed for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166322873#t=2275s">00:37:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">him.
