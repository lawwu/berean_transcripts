And so we looked at the power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=149s">00:02:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">behind our salvation and why we ought not to be ashamed and to proclaim it with boldness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=156s">00:02:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">When we think about salvation, I think we need to be very specific in what we mean by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=160s">00:02:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation. Because if we have a superficial understanding of salvation, we automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=165s">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have a superficial application of what that salvation means. In English, when we say something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=171s">00:02:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is saved, or we save something, we usually mean two things. One, you saving something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=177s">00:02:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">salvaging something from danger. So we will say that if somebody is drowning and we rescued</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=182s">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them, we say we were saved, or we saved them. Or somebody was in danger in any kind, got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=189s">00:03:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in an accident and so they needed help, so the ambulance came and saved them. So we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=193s">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one meaning where we are saving them from some kind of danger, some kind of harm. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=198s">00:03:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">second meaning of the word save in English is to preserve something for something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=206s">00:03:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would save money. So if you make $100, you save 10% of that and you put it into your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=212s">00:03:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bank and you leave it there for something else. Or, you know, all the time you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=219s">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have some great things on your plate to eat and you would save one part of it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=223s">00:03:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you are savoring it for the end. You know, you say, "Why are you not eating that?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=227s">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I'm saving it. So we have these two meanings. One is to save us from danger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=232s">00:03:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The other one is saving for something. Saving from something, saving for something. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=239s">00:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the question that we have this morning, we talk about saving for something. We're very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=244s">00:04:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar with being saved from something. We're saved from the penalty of the law, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=249s">00:04:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saved from God's judgment, His wrath, we're saved from hell. But when we talk about saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=254s">00:04:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for something, where the scripture says, "You are a chosen race," 1 Peter 2, 9-10, "a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=261s">00:04:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession." So we're saved for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=265s">00:04:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">him, that we belong to him, that we are his children. But then he goes on to say, "That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=271s">00:04:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=275s">00:04:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">light." So not only were we saved from something, we're saved for the purpose of declaring His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=280s">00:04:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">glory. Ephesians 2, 10, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=286s">00:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them." He saved us from danger for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=292s">00:04:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of glorifying God through good works.

When we look at Apostle Paul, and we look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=521s">00:08:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Scripture, and we look at these people, and we highlight certain things, but is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=526s">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">normal?

So, verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=564s">00:09:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">16 and 17 is the foundation, is the conclusion of everything that he said about who he is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=568s">00:09:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Gospel he came to preach, and the ministry that he's committed to. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=573s">00:09:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he's going to start in verse 18, he said, "Well, the wrath of God is being revealed,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=575s">00:09:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and he's going to go into the details of the Gospel. But 16 and 17 is pretty much, in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=580s">00:09:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nutshell, the summary of everything that he wants to say, and is going to say. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=586s">00:09:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">why it's worth taking some time to dive into it a little bit further, as we looked at verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=590s">00:09:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">16, we're going to look at verse 17, where this power to save us, where we get the boldness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=596s">00:09:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to preach, is also the same power that gives us the strength to persevere. So, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=602s">00:10:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that we see is that this power to save us, in verse 17, says, "It is when we behold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=608s">00:10:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">His righteousness." Because that's what he says, he says, "I'm not ashamed, the power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=613s">00:10:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of God's salvation, for in it the righteousness of God is revealed." So, the first thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=620s">00:10:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">happens, every single one of us that became a Christian, you heard the Gospel message,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=625s">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and you, the righteousness of God, the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ was revealed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=629s">00:10:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to us. Now, what does that mean? When we typically think about the Gospel or the cross, we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=636s">00:10:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">think of righteousness, we typically think of His grace, His mercy, and His patience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=641s">00:10:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and desire to forgive our sins. But again, whenever we read the Scriptures, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=646s">00:10:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about how the early Jews would have taken this. Because before we start with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=652s">00:10:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Matthew, you have to understand that there were thousands of years of preparation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=657s">00:10:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for the coming of Christ. So, it's very helpful for, in fact, I would say it is necessary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=664s">00:11:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for us to understand that when Paul says that in the Gospel the righteousness of God is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=669s">00:11:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">revealed, that we think like a Jew first. To a Jewish mind, this would have made a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=676s">00:11:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of sense, because if you remember at the beginning of the creation of the nation of Israel, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=684s">00:11:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">made it very clear, "Here are the set of laws that I'm going to give you. If you obey it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=689s">00:11:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, you're going to live, you're going to prosper, God's going to bless you." But then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=692s">00:11:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">here's this other part, "If you don't live by this, here are the curses that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=697s">00:11:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to come upon you." And all through the nation of Israel, if you've ever consistently read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=702s">00:11:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through the history of Israel, by the time you get to about first king, second king,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=707s">00:11:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean it is dark. You get to a point, I remember preaching through the kings, by the time I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=713s">00:11:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">get to the second king, I would sit there preparing this message thinking, "Oh my gosh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=718s">00:11:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">again. Again." And I can see why pastors don't preach through the Old Testament, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=724s">00:12:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's depressing. By the time you get to about, it doesn't take long, as soon as they enter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=730s">00:12:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">into the promised land, they fall into one sin after another. And it's a constant cycle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=735s">00:12:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of God judging them, restoring them, God judging them, restoring them, and almost after about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=739s">00:12:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">100, 200 years, you would think God had enough. You know, so typically when we read the Old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=745s">00:12:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament in chunks, we say, "Oh God is so vengeful, because we see Him judging." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=750s">00:12:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if you follow along the history, I think you will have the same thing that I did.

Why doesn't He just come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=761s">00:12:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and crush them and start over? Why?"

And so you end up finishing the book of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=780s">00:13:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Old Testament with this sense of, "Oh my gosh, something bad, really bad is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=786s">00:13:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">come, because all the curses that He said was going to happen, now is going to be stored</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=790s">00:13:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">up, it's going to happen."

And let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=803s">00:13:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">me give you a sample of this.

But this verse pretty much signifies, like every time He talks about judgment, He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=813s">00:13:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">qualifies it with a promise.

"Who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=818s">00:13:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression?

At that time a family would have been grandfather,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=914s">00:15:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">grandmother, you know, the uncles and aunts and all the grandchildren, and it would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=919s">00:15:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">been maybe 30, maybe if it was a large family 60, 70 people. And each family on this Day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=926s">00:15:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of Atonement would have to offer up a sacrifice. And they said, the archaeologists and historians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=931s">00:15:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">said that at that particular time over 250,000 lambs were slaughtered on the Day of Atonement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=940s">00:15:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">250,000. And so you can imagine what that scene would have looked like. You know, typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=946s">00:15:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when we see the picture of the Temple, you see a pristine picture of gold and shiny marble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=952s">00:15:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">walls. But on the Day of Atonement, can you imagine 250,000 animals being slaughtered?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=959s">00:15:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they weren't just slaughtered. Their blood is gushing out everywhere. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=961s">00:16:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">took this blood and they had to sprinkle it on the curtains, sprinkle it on the altar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=965s">00:16:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sprinkle it everywhere. It was one massive bloody scene. But that wasn't enough. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=973s">00:16:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">had to be done every year as long as Israel existed. And they knew that that wasn't enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=978s">00:16:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and it wouldn't be permanent. That this had to be done over and over. And this is one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=983s">00:16:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Day of Atonement. So when God promised the nation of Israel that all their sins would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=988s">00:16:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be wiped out forever, how would He have done that? Is He just going to neglect everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=994s">00:16:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that He's been teaching the nation of Israel? Is He going to go against everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=999s">00:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been teaching and say, "You know what? This Temple sacrifices, giving of animals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1002s">00:16:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this stuff, I'm just going to forget about it." So the question would have remained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1007s">00:16:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how is He going to do this? That's why in 1 Peter 1, 10 through 11, it describes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1014s">00:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">prophets who are giving these prophecies about this forgiveness. It says this, "Concerning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1018s">00:16:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, searched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1023s">00:17:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1030s">00:17:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories." In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1034s">00:17:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they were looking intently, how is this going to happen? If 250,000 animals being slaughtered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1040s">00:17:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is not enough, what animal does He have in mind that's going to take care of this? Who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1047s">00:17:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to do this? What would be sufficient to cover the sins of mankind? Who would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1055s">00:17:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ever thought, what Jew would have ever thought, that He would send His only begotten Son?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1062s">00:17:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That this person that He was referring to was His own Son? And so when the Scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1067s">00:17:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "It is the power of God unto salvation, for in it the righteousness of God is revealed."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1075s">00:17:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What He's saying is, we know the grace of God, we know that because He promised it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1079s">00:17:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but how will He fulfill this in His righteousness? It is when that revelation was revealed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1087s">00:18:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">us. And we're not talking about information. We're not talking about you heard it, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1091s">00:18:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Oh, that made sense to me." The revelation that He's referring to here, when it was revealed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1096s">00:18:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to us by faith, is not just information. We're talking about illumination. Somebody can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1102s">00:18:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the church all his life and hear it, and even recite the Gospel to you, and tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1107s">00:18:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"This is what the Gospel is. I know what it is." But that's not when you got saved. How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1113s">00:18:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">many of your testimony will say, "You know, I grew up in the church, heard the Gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1117s">00:18:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ever since I was a little kid, but I didn't get saved until I was in 10th grade, or 12th</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1122s">00:18:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">grade, or I was in college, or beyond that, when it made sense to me, when it hit me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1130s">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is real." So this revelation He's talking about is not just something, "Oh, I heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1136s">00:18:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it and it made sense." He's talking about this revelation, "God illumined you. He opened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1143s">00:19:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your eyes to see the truth of this." Not because all of it made sense, but all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1148s">00:19:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it became real. And He says, "This happened by faith." Now, none of this stuff up to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1155s">00:19:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">point is new. We believe that our salvation is by faith. And we believe it's because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1161s">00:19:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">glory of the Gospel has been revealed, and my eyes got opened, and I believed, and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1164s">00:19:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">changed my life. But it's the second part when it says, "Righteousness of God is revealed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1168s">00:19:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from faith for faith." Now, what does that mean, "from faith for faith"? Now, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1174s">00:19:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">add meaning to that, but I think the NIV actually does a pretty good job explaining to us what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1180s">00:19:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He means by "from faith to faith." In NIV, that's not what it says in Greek, but that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1185s">00:19:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much in agreement with all the other biblical scholars will say this is what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1189s">00:19:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">means. NIV translates Romans 117, it says, "Righteousness of God is revealed from faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1196s">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">by faith, from first to last." That's how it translates it. So some of you guys who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1202s">00:20:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have NIV, that's what it says in your Bible. In the other translation, it'll say, "from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1206s">00:20:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">faith, for faith," or "faith to faith." But the meaning behind that phrase is that from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1211s">00:20:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the beginning to the end, from the start to the finish, it is by faith. That's what He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1217s">00:20:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">means by that. So, in other words, what He's saying is this salvation that saves us, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1222s">00:20:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we ought to be bold in, happened when the righteousness of God was revealed to us from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1229s">00:20:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">now until the end, until we continue. And that's why in Hebrews 12, verse 2, after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1237s">00:20:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">eleven chapters of exposition of who Jesus is, He says, "To continue to fix your eyes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1245s">00:20:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">upon Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our faith, the beginner and the finisher of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1251s">00:20:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">our faith." So, in other words, we begin with faith, and we persevere in faith, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1258s">00:20:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then we conclude in faith. Now, in faith in what? In faith in what? So we think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1267s">00:21:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if faith is what saves us, what faith is He referring to? Well, in the immediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1273s">00:21:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">context, He says, "the faith of the revelation of the righteousness of God." Now, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1279s">00:21:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ask, say, "Well, faith in that God is sovereign, faith that God is powerful, God is omnipotent."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1283s">00:21:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All true. But in the context when He says, "Faith that we saw," right, "that revealed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1292s">00:21:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">God's righteousness and which saved us," that faith that you believe that your sins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1297s">00:21:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">were forgiven by the blood of Christ, "will start you and will finish you." Let me make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1306s">00:21:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a stronger point here, which I think Paul is doing, the second phrase when he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1309s">00:21:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"The righteous shall live by faith." Now, that's a direct quote from Habakkuk 2.4, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1316s">00:21:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that same phrase is repeated twice again in the New Testament. And I think it will help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1321s">00:22:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">us to see what Paul means by this by looking at it. So, first, all the places that he repeats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1326s">00:22:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in Galatians 3.10-11. So, those of you who have your Bibles can turn your Bibles to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1330s">00:22:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">passage Galatians 3.10-11. And then we're going to go to Hebrews 10.37-38, another passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1338s">00:22:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that has that quote. Now, I think Paul wrote both, Galatians and Hebrews, but that's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1343s">00:22:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">argument for another date, you know. But whatever it is that you believe, Galatians 3.10 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1349s">00:22:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews 10.37 is where we see that same phrase, Habakkuk 2.4 repeated in Romans 1.17, Galatians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1356s">00:22:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">3.10-11, and Hebrews 10.37-38. Now, in order to have a better understanding, gain deeper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1365s">00:22:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">insight as to what does Paul mean here by righteous shall live by faith, I think when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1369s">00:22:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we look at those two, it'll help us, okay, or confuse you. Okay, we'll see, all right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1376s">00:22:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So Galatians 3.10-11, I want you to understand the context of this letter. This letter is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1380s">00:23:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">written to a church that was being affected by the Judaizers, who were telling them that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1386s">00:23:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to be circumcised and you have to follow the Jewish rituals in order for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1390s">00:23:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a Christian. So he's fighting against legalism in Galatians. And so in that context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1396s">00:23:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, Galatians 3.10, "For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1401s">00:23:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1406s">00:23:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">book of the law, and do them.'" Okay, so this is where the verse is. "Now, it is evident</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1411s">00:23:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that no one is justified before God by the law, for the righteous shall live by faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1417s">00:23:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, same phrase, but if you're paying attention to the context, the comma here is after "shall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1427s">00:23:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">live." Okay, so if you're half asleep right now, you're not following, right? We're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1432s">00:23:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit technical here, but I want you to pay attention, okay. The comma here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1437s">00:23:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"the righteous shall live by faith." That's what Paul is saying, right? "The righteous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1443s">00:24:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">shall live by faith," because he's addressing a group of people who are saying, "You've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1448s">00:24:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">got to do all of these things to be saved." So he's saying, "No, the righteous shall live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1452s">00:24:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">by faith." That's the emphasis here. But let's go to Hebrews 10.37-38. Now, let me set this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1460s">00:24:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up. Here's the same group of people, second, third generation Christians, who are Jews,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1466s">00:24:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">who are reverting back to their old life, again, wrestling with legalism, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1471s">00:24:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so he spent 10 chapters talking about how Jesus is more superior to everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1479s">00:24:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's about—you guys know chapter 11. What is Hebrews chapter 11 known for? The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1482s">00:24:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter of faith, right? It's chapter of faith, right? So he's about to get into chapter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1493s">00:24:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">faith and what faith is and what it looks like in the lives of a believer, lives of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1496s">00:24:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the believers. And so what he says in Hebrews 10.37-38 is to set up for chapter 11, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1503s">00:25:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this is what he says, "For yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1508s">00:25:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not delay, but my righteous one shall live by faith. And if he shrinks back, my soul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1514s">00:25:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">has no pleasure in him." Right? What is he referring to here? He's talking about life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1521s">00:25:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because he's—in chapter 11 he says, "Because of this faith, they did these crazy things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1526s">00:25:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of faith, they left their homes and they suffered. Because of faith, they went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1529s">00:25:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out and they were put into prison. Because of faith, they followed him." And it's faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1533s">00:25:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that gives you the strength to live, right? That's what he's saying. That's why he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1538s">00:25:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"If my people shrink back, my soul has no pleasure in them." So in this context, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1544s">00:25:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">emphasis is on live. So here, the way you should read it, "The righteous one shall live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1551s">00:25:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">by faith." Right? So the emphasis here is different. In Galatians, it says, "The righteous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1557s">00:25:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">shall live by faith." And here it says, "The righteous one shall live by faith." Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1563s">00:26:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so again, if you are half asleep, you have no idea why this guy is making a lot of noise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1568s">00:26:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know what I mean? Just get it over with, okay? But this is extremely crucial to understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1573s">00:26:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what Paul is about to get into. Why he's saying, "What's the foundation in which we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1578s">00:26:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to get into it?" Which is it? Well, the answer is pretty clear. It's both. It's both. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1588s">00:26:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you cannot understand salvation independent of justification and sanctification and glorification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1594s">00:26:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we've kind of—the theologians have compartmentalized the beginning, middle, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1598s">00:26:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the end. We oftentimes kind of address it differently, right? But the Bible never dichotomizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1606s">00:26:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation that way. That salvation is past, present, and future at all times. An individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1612s">00:26:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is justified, is being justified, and will be justified. The Bible describes it all as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1618s">00:26:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. So is the emphasis on live, or is the emphasis on faith? It is both. Is Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1628s">00:27:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Son of God, or God? Yes. Is God sovereign, or are we responsible? Yes. There are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1640s">00:27:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Scripture that looks like a paradox, but in reality, it can't be—it's for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1646s">00:27:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of emphasis. So here, the way we ought to read this passage is, "The righteous shall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1653s">00:27:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">live by faith." And every part of what he says here is an exclamation mark. "The righteous"—you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1660s">00:27:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">become righteous by the blood of Christ—"shall live"—because you've been purchased by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1664s">00:27:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">blood of Christ—you will continue to live. And you will continue to do this by faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1669s">00:27:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when any part of this is minimized in our walk with God, you miss the point. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1677s">00:27:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">miss what empowers and strengthens us. Perseverance is not an option. That's part of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1685s">00:28:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In Colossians 1:22-23, "He has now reconciled in His body the flesh by His death, in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1691s">00:28:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before Him, if indeed you continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1697s">00:28:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the faith." That same faith that saved you, that you continue in it, stable and steadfast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1706s">00:28:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not shifting from the hope of the Gospel that you heard, that we became Christians because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1712s">00:28:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we recognized that you and I were not able, and Christ forgave us.

And we were floored and awed by that. And that's why we came to church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1731s">00:28:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's why we wanted to serve the church.

If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away like a branch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1984s">00:33:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and withers.

If you abide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1989s">00:33:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in me, in my words, abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=1996s">00:33:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is my Father who is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2002s">00:33:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

In other words, if you've been walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2014s">00:33:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and doing anything without abiding in him, you probably are experiencing exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2020s">00:33:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he said was going to happen.

It is impossible to bear fruit unless you abide in me. You can do nothing. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2029s">00:33:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't pray if you're not abiding.

So, not everybody's prayer is heard. You say, no, God answers every prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2040s">00:34:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, he doesn't.

You can't bear fruit. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2050s">00:34:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can't please God. You can't honor him.

When I used to read this passage, abide, and say, well, abide means obey.

But the root word of this, the meaning behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2086s">00:34:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this word abide, meno, means to stay or to remain.

Now, when we hear the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2415s">00:40:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, you know, Jesus Christ, we think that's His last name. You know, Peter Kim, John Lee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2419s">00:40:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, it's Jesus Christ.

And so when Peter says, "You are the Christ,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2445s">00:40:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what he's saying is, "You are Messiah, you are the Savior, you are the Son, and you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2451s">00:40:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the God of the living Son of the living God." And so what Peter confesses is what saves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526439#t=2460s">00:41:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">us.
