class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=26s">00:00:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also think about how, in previous generations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=30s">00:00:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when someone would have a grievance, they would do things like burn books or burn a flag, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=36s">00:00:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And did you know that for the longest time in American history, it was illegal to do such a thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=42s">00:00:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">To be

more freedom and people fighting for freedom of speech, it's not illegal anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=52s">00:00:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's two camps who debate back and forth, is it right, is it not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=57s">00:00:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But both agree that that act is a strong symbolic statement, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=65s">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's meaning behind what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=67s">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And likewise for us, I would like us to think about the idea of symbolism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=72s">00:01:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and how symbolism tries to get all of our attention upon the meaning of what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=79s">00:01:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a passage in 1 Peter 3, verse 21-22 that says this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=85s">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=89s">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=94s">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=99s">00:01:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with angels' authorities and powers having been subjected to him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=103s">00:01:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this passage is quite profound because it says here, "Baptism now saves you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=110s">00:01:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So does this baptism save the people who are being baptized?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=114s">00:01:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=115s">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He says very clearly that the mechanical act of going into the water and coming out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=120s">00:02:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, you might get clean, you might get wet, but it doesn't save you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=125s">00:02:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But what it does do is explicitly tells us what is true of them spiritually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=132s">00:02:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">These individuals are trying to express, proclaim, and tell us what's true of them that we can't see with our eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=140s">00:02:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today, they hope to not necessarily be saved by the baptism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=146s">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but in their baptism, they're following through with what is already a reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=149s">00:02:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is already a reality in their inner person, what is already a reality in what God has done for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=155s">00:02:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The physical baptism represents that they have repented and appealed, it says, to God for forgiveness of their sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=163s">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that this is made possible by the death, the burial, and the resurrection of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=169s">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because of what this means, today actually, I mean, although, yes, the baptism does not save them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=176s">00:02:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we wouldn't change what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=178s">00:02:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, perhaps before you guys got to this worship service, you guys thought, "Wow, 12 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=184s">00:03:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, we have anywhere from six to seven, so 12, it can be a little bit long."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=189s">00:03:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, my thing, to make this more efficient, let's just stand them up here in a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=193s">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">take a garden hose and just hose them down, you know, all together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=197s">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, what would that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would that signify for them, that opportunity they get to proclaim and profess the name of Christ and their union with them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=207s">00:03:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How would it express that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=210s">00:03:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">How would it communicate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, with that said, there's actually an encouragement for all of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=216s">00:03:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If we have truly been clothed with Christ, if we've truly been united with Him, if His death is my death,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=223s">00:03:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if His resurrection truly is my resurrection and my victory, then we actually need to proclaim that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=230s">00:03:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether it's already in baptism you've done, and also in our daily lives, there is this admonition for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=237s">00:03:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to be expressive. If we're not passionate and we're not dramatic people, that's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when things matter, when certain things mean something so weighty and so powerful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=249s">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there has to be expressed in our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=251s">00:04:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It cannot be something hidden. It cannot be something that only I know, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=256s">00:04:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather, this gospel message that's true for us, God has ordained that we would share it and shine it as a light to the rest of the world.

href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=484s">00:08:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So my only response was to praise him, repent of my sins, and devote my life to him in obedience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=490s">00:08:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And these changes began to trickle outwardly, and my friends and family,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=493s">00:08:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">people who knew me best, were starting to notice and comment too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=497s">00:08:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So Mark, my husband, he would continuously ask me if I was sure I was saved before I was baptized at that young age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=504s">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But my pride, fear of public speaking, embarrassment from the possibility of telling everyone I was wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=509s">00:08:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and just the fact that I really, really, really did not want to get baptized again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=514s">00:08:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">convinced me and helped me convince others that my baptism and early conversion were genuine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=520s">00:08:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I watched others get re-baptized time and time again, and I would squash that doubt that maybe my baptism wasn't true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=526s">00:08:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So several weeks ago, there was one night where I just couldn't sleep because I was so convicted of this sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=532s">00:08:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The fact that I lied to others, myself, God, about my baptism was finally revealed to me at full force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=538s">00:08:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw that I put my selfishness, comfort, and pride above proclaiming my faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=543s">00:09:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was very ashamed of this sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=545s">00:09:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't want God to think I was ashamed of him or ashamed of my faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=549s">00:09:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I knew I had to be baptized, this time as a true believer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=552s">00:09:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, I didn't want to base my decisions off a late-night conviction and feelings alone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=557s">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but as I prayed on it and meditated on it, the conviction stuck, and I repented, and the guilt began to fade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=563s">00:09:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He's just so gracious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=565s">00:09:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So evidences of grace in my life are so numerous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=569s">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be seen from the beginning when he used my non-Christian parents to introduce me to the gospel and to church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=574s">00:09:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">planting that seed of faith, to college, where he revealed the whole truth and gap in my life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=579s">00:09:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way to the present,

can be summed by this one verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=589s">00:09:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"But now in Christ Jesus, you who

href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=750s">00:12:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was old news for me, because since I was 11, they've always been like that.</span></div><div

them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=759s">00:12:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They would kind of come to me and tell me their problems

me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=766s">00:12:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I became really, like, jaded to the whole meaning of love and

affected my relationships on after that with friends and family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=780s">00:13:00.600</a></span> | <span

of fought with my family a lot, and I didn't really listen to them, because mainly I didn't know what was best for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=789s">00:13:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think throughout high school, I just--I looked towards worldly things for comfort, and it was really just a hard time for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=803s">00:13:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess junior year, my friend Nick, he actually invited me out to Power of Prayer, which was a Christian club at our school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=811s">00:13:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I went once, and I never went again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=814s">00:13:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But honestly, it kind of stuck with me, and senior year came around, and I had more free time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=820s">00:13:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of started going out more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=824s">00:13:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I got--there I kind of started getting bits and pieces of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=828s">00:13:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that kind of helped me understand more of what I had learned previously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=835s">00:13:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I tried--eventually I started looking out for a church to go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=840s">00:14:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And summer came around, and I visited Breanne, and I really liked it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=843s">00:14:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a very welcoming community, and I enjoyed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=846s">00:14:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, during summer, though, my grandpa actually passed away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=851s">00:14:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that was really hard for my family, just because he was--I was on my mom's side, and he was the last remaining relative in the country for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=861s">00:14:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, I think that really affected us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=867s">00:14:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That night, like, that night going to the hospital, I couldn't really get there in time to say goodbye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=876s">00:14:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He was already on life support by the time I got there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=879s">00:14:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think standing there and seeing his chest being powered by the machine was--the presence of death was extremely prominent at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=891s">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really convicted me of how I've been throughout my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=896s">00:14:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And knowing bits and pieces of the gospel throughout our prayer, and I kind of realized how sinful I was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=903s">00:15:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was just extremely convicted to want to save my parents

repent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=914s">00:15:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that night I went home, and almost immediately I went to my room and just cried and repented to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=921s">00:15:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think after realizing how much of a sinner I was, and I deserve no better than that, I tried really hard to convince my parents to start coming out to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

would just talk to me about how my grades were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4206s">01:10:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And just during this whole time, I stopped going to fellowship completely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4211s">01:10:11.600</a></span> | <span

church that were trying to reach out to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4218s">01:10:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but I made the decision to close myself off to everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4223s">01:10:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt like I was alone and I had no one to comfort me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4231s">01:10:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, during that time, I wasn't seeking God at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4235s">01:10:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was really focused on myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4238s">01:10:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very jealous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4242s">01:10:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very envious of everyone because I really didn't know why all of this was happening to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4250s">01:10:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it got to the point where I just didn't really want to live anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4257s">01:10:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, the summer leading into college, my home pastor decided he wanted to see how I was doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4269s">01:11:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And for some reason, I didn't close myself off to him, but because of the respect that I had for him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4277s">01:11:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I agreed to meet up with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4280s">01:11:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt like during that meeting, that was a meeting that really changed my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4287s">01:11:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It really changed how I viewed certain things on life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4294s">01:11:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I told him what was going on in high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4297s">01:11:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And he told me, you know, like, throughout that whole time, you weren't alone because God was always there with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4305s">01:11:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was something that really convicted my heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4309s">01:11:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's something that I definitely hold on to all the way up to today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4315s">01:11:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And something that he also really stressed about is the importance of finding a fellowship and a church when going to college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4324s">01:12:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of the respect that I had for him, I guess I just wanted to try it out again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4330s">01:12:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I agreed to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4332s">01:12:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">When I came to UCI, I joined CCM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4337s">01:12:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And CCM was definitely a group that really, really grew me in my faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4348s">01:12:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, joining CCM was really great for me because I joined small groups at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4353s">01:12:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And small groups single-handedly changed my perception of Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4359s">01:12:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And although I grew up in the church and all my life thought that I was a believer and I was saved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4363s">01:12:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I came to realize what being a Christian was all about, and that was to honor and glorify God in all that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4371s">01:12:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not during this time that I truly accepted Christ to be my one and true Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4377s">01:12:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, during CCM small groups, we would go through Fundamentals of the Faith, as well as Desiring God by John Piper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4384s">01:13:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I began reading my Bible and actually praying to God out of a genuine desire to really learn more about him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4392s">01:13:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and really to connect with him in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4395s">01:13:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And my love for God grew so much during this time because I knew that he was watching over me throughout this whole transition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4404s">01:13:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was during this time where I really felt convicted by the gospel message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4410s">01:13:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really came to understand how much God loved and sacrificed for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4416s">01:13:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew that I could trust God, knowing that it was truly his sacrifice that saved me from my sin and destination of hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4424s">01:13:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I did not just believe that God was real, but I knew that he was real, due to the circumstances and how my first year of college went about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4433s">01:13:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">My eyes opened, making me realize how much of a sinner that I was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4437s">01:13:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember truly repenting over my sins and asking God for forgiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4443s">01:14:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There were definitely a lot of people that really played a role during my first year of college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4448s">01:14:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of older brothers that really reached out to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4453s">01:14:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of them, so I don't want to name them all, but I just want to say that I love you guys a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4460s">01:14:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys are definitely the reason why I'm still committed to church and CCM, just because you guys are encouragements to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4472s">01:14:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you guys are definitely the light for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4477s">01:14:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I found a home and family at Berean Community Church, and I really feel connected to God at Berean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4485s">01:14:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone has definitely welcomed me with a joyful

Christ, and I believe that through CCM and Berean, I can accomplish that goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4497s">01:14:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been baptized before, back when I was a junior in high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/168688240#t=4501s">01:15:01.600</a></span>
