Let me get us started with a few announcements. First of all, today after the second service at 1.30 in the main sanctuary, we have the parents meeting at 1.30 in this room. So if you have a child in the seeds department, that's the four and under, please come at 1.30 and they're gonna be giving you updates, the teachers, the curriculum, and all that stuff.</p><p>And if you have any questions, they'll be able to answer at that time. So please stick around, grab lunch, and come back here by 1.30. This coming Saturday at 9 a.m., we have an all church cleaning and maintenance day. And so I was asked by the logistics team to give it a little bit push because we have, we have some people signed up, but we need more.</p><p>And so if you're available this Saturday, please come. And I think there is a sign up table. If you go outside, you can sign up there just to let us know. And then there's very specific areas that needs to be covered. So if you're available, they asked me to give a little bit of push so you can come and help out with that.</p><p>Okay, this coming Saturday. On August 24th at 10 a.m., our outreach group, they've been very busy and doing a great job. We have a volleyball park day specifically for the purpose of outreach. If you have a co-worker, family, or friend that you want to reach out to, they're going to be having a picnic, you know, centered around volleyball.</p><p>And they did this once already, and it was very effective. And so many of our church members brought family and friends out to that event. And so they're asking if you have that and you can benefit from that, you want somebody to come. That day is happening on August 24th at 10 a.m.</p><p>So more specific announcements for that are on the website in our church app. So please check for more information on that. The Tenfold Covenant Bible study that we're starting. So again, this session of Bible, this fall Bible study is going to be a little bit different. Instead of an inductive Bible study, we're going to be going over the Tenfold Covenant.</p><p>And we want to kind of try to bring our church together on the same page because we have so many people who are new coming into the church. And then we have a lot of people who've been at our church for a while that we want to make sure that we're building our church very purposefully.</p><p>And so that's why we're going over the reasoning and the theology behind the Tenfold Covenant. And we will also be reading all together, the whole church together, Master's Plan for the church. And so please sign. If you haven't signed up for that, please sign up. The small groups have already been made.</p><p>So people who are signing up now, we may have to put new groups in. So please, if you are planning to come, please sign up. Or else you're going to end up going into an overflow group with all the newcomers that are coming without signing up. Okay, so please sign.</p><p>If you haven't done so, please do that as soon as possible. And then lastly, some of you guys who are interested, our annual BBA tournament, I don't know what you call it, sign-ups are going to be delayed a bit because they moved the dates from September to January. Okay, so the reason behind that is because of the schedule conflicts that we keep running into with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up and various things and students coming into town in September.</p><p>And so they moved it to January. So January, it will be sometime early January. Sign-ups will probably go out sometime in November. So if you are planning to play, and this is all true of WBBA and then the LBBA, okay, Legend BBA. So if you are planning to play, the sign-ups will be in November and they'll begin in January, okay?</p><p>All right, let me pray for us. I'll give you a minute to give the offering. And then again, our physical offering box is in the back as your exit. Okay, let's pray. Father, we thank you for this morning. Lord, as you taught us that what you are looking for are people who will worship you in spirit and in truth.</p><p>I pray that you will search us and know us, that we would give you worship, Lord God, that you deserve. I pray that you would stir in our hearts a greater vision of Christ, that what we give you would not be simply lip service, but our very beings, our whole heart.</p><p>I pray that even in this giving that it would be an act of worship, act of surrender, act of acknowledging, Lord God, that you are our Lord. And may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
