The shepherd.  The wise man.  A diaper.  Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to hop those who are lame.  He grows to eighteen.  Because it's Jesus' birthday. To celebrate the birth of Jesus. He is the son of God and he died for our sins. Because he's the saviour of the world. He created us. He made us. Because he's the saviour and the Christ. To die for our sins. To pay for our sins. To save us from our sins. To clear our sins. To die on the cross to save us from our sins. How do you get eternal life? Why do we have a digestive system? How was it possible that you were able to resurrect? Why do crabs only walk sideways? How will us turn from time for Christmas? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas, guys! Woo!    Joy to the world! The Lord is come. Let earth receive her King. Let every heart prepare Him room. And heaven and nature sing. And heaven and nature sing. And heaven and nature sing.  Joy to the world! The Savior reigns. Let all their songs employ. Wild fields and floods, Rocks, hills and plains. Repeat the sounding joy. Repeat the sounding joy. Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.  Joy, a speaker for joy. In all the glowing hells, No tongue can tell. Joy, a speaker for joy. Rises in my soul, never lets me go. He rules the world with truth and grace. And makes the nations prove The glories of His righteousness, And wonders of His love, And wonders of His love, And wonders, wonders of His love. Joy! And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell. Joy! And speak of the joy, Risen in my soul, never let me go. Joy! And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell. Joy! And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell. In the same region there were shepherds out in the fields, keeping watch over the flowering lights. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fears. And the angel said to them, "Fear not for behold, I am an angel, and there is a great joy that will be for all the people." For unto His wondrous name, the city of David, the Savior was Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you, you will find a beauty raptist born with cause, lying in a manger. And he had woven the angel's mouth to set it at me, and was praying God is saved. Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace among those whom He has pleased.
