href="https://www.vimeo.com/284515086#t=1307s">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you see that word in your English Bible, chances are it's a translation of the word

and fellowship was very much a chief concern of the Apostle Paul as he wrote this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284515086#t=1326s">00:22:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's something that I think is rather interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284515086#t=1329s">00:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you know that the Bible, not once, never does the Bible ever command Christians to create koinonia?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284515086#t=1340s">00:22:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Never once in the Bible will you be told to create

fellowship, can only be accomplished by God and God alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284515086#t=1356s">00:22:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He
