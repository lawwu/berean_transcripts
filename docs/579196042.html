noticed that this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=386s">00:06:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that was beautiful that they're not

was memorable to me was the gathering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=410s">00:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of people who were there to truly celebrate together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=414s">00:06:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've been to weddings where, you know, the parents are very influential, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=419s">00:06:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they have so many

and more than half, or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=425s">00:07:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">two-thirds are guests from

grow up and want to participate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=434s">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them come out of obligation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=436s">00:07:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, he came to my wedding, so I have to invite them to our wedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=439s">00:07:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So they gave a hundred, I'll give a hundred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=441s">00:07:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they have a lot of that dynamic going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=444s">00:07:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And in order to not be cussed out, they get the honored seats in the front, and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=450s">00:07:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">friends get the back seat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=452s">00:07:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they go through the motion, and they feed them, and then they leave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=456s">00:07:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the first ones to leave because they've shown their face, given their gift, they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=459s">00:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">eaten, they're gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=460s">00:07:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they wait until their friends in the back, you know, "Hey, can you come to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=463s">00:07:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the front so we can start this real ceremony?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=466s">00:07:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=467s">00:07:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've been to weddings like that where they're just kind of like appeasing people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=471s">00:07:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who are there, but just not genuinely celebrating what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=474s">00:07:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are the three things that stand out to me, like what was memorable to a wedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=479s">00:07:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So husband and wife, they're there, and they, like, that's their focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=482s">00:08:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They really are happy that they're getting married.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=485s">00:08:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And two, worship was at the center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=488s">00:08:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And third, there was a genuine celebration of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=492s">00:08:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now all of this is connected to the text that we're looking at because Mount Zion is described</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=498s">00:08:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as a celebration.</span></div><div

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=507s">00:08:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning behind it because it just says it's an assembly of myriads of angels, a general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=512s">00:08:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">assembly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=514s">00:08:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That word "general assembly" has more significance than what it says in the NASB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=518s">00:08:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">NASB is just literally, if you translate it, that's what it means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=522s">00:08:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at the ESV, and I'm going to also read the NASB, it says this, "But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=526s">00:08:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you have come to Mount Zion and to the

angels in festal gathering."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=536s">00:08:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in Hebrews 12, 22, NIV, "But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=541s">00:09:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the city

that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=553s">00:09:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">In the NASB, it just says "general assembly."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=556s">00:09:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It just seems like, you know what I mean, you're having a town hall meeting or you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=560s">00:09:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">getting together, we're going to clean the church, everybody assemble, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=564s">00:09:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We're having a, you know, a members meeting after this, so that's also an assembly, general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=569s">00:09:29.320</a></span> | <span

out in the ESV and NIV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=575s">00:09:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just any gathering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=576s">00:09:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=578s">00:09:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why it's called a "festal gathering."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=581s">00:09:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That is why it's called, again in NIV, a "joyful assembly."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=585s">00:09:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the description here is more akin to like a wedding ceremony, where there is an assembly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=592s">00:09:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but the assembly is for the purpose of celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/579196042#t=595s">00:09:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how Zion is described here.</span></div><div class="c"><span
