this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=125">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been doing everything right, or I thought I was doing everything right, so why did this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=129">00:02:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">happen to me?"</span></div><div

happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=145">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought that after such a life-altering experience, my life would change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=149">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be imbibed with a will to do all the things I was supposed to do as a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=154">00:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet it didn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=155">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">When church wasn't fun anymore, my desire to serve dissipated and my desire to see Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=159">00:02:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">dissipated as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/710421755&t=162">00:02:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Going into college, I carried the same questions and
