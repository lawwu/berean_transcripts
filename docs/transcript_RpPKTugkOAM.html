We're glad that you're able to join us again. This week, again, we want to be deep in prayer, praying much, but also engrossed in the scriptures, reflecting and meditating about all the work that Christ has done. As we begin our evening devotion, let's begin with a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we want to commune with you much this week, Lord, particularly Father God, reflecting upon your incredible salvation work that the scripture says is a mystery, a grand mystery from ages before you have been working. And your saints long to look at all the different parts, at all the elements, God. And according to your wisdom, according to your timetable, you have unfolded your plan. And for us, we have such a unique privilege, God, and we're so thankful that we can look back. We can look back at the salvation work of Christ. And I pray that that would have such significance to us personally. And Lord, as we devote our time to you, would you bless us for doing so, God, with faith. Lord, that our thoughts of you would be strengthened, it would be more clear, what's more, our affection for you would grow. And God, reflecting upon your love, and again, your amazing work towards us, and your grace. Lord, we thank you. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.  Who else commands? Who else commands all the hosts of heaven? Who else can make every king bow down? Who else can whisper and darkness tremble? Only a holy God. What other beauty demands such praising? What other splendor outshines the sun? What other majesty rules with justice? Only a holy God. Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.  What other glory consumes like fire? What other power can raise the dead? What other name remains undefeated? Only a holy God. Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God. Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.  Who else? Who else could rescue me from my failing? Who else could offer His only Son? Who else invites me to call Him Father? Only a holy God. Only a holy God. Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God. Come and behold Him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.   Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims that hurt upon this earth. It speaks righteousness for me. It stands in my defense. Jesus, it's Your blood. Your blood, Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims that hurt upon this earth. It speaks righteousness for me. It stands in my defense. Jesus, it's Your blood. What can wash away our sins? What can make us whole again? Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can wash us pure as snow? Welcomed as the friends of God. Nothing but the blood, nothing but Your blood, King Jesus. Your blood testifies in grace. It's over the Father's heart to make a way for us. How boldly we have fought, how earthly confident. Jesus, it's Your blood. What can wash away our sins? What can make us whole again? Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can wash us pure as snow? Welcomed as the friends of God. Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood, King Jesus. What can wash away our sins? What can make us whole again? Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can wash us pure as snow? Welcomed as the friends of God. Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood, King Jesus. Amen. Good evening. Tonight we are reflecting on the Wednesday of the Passion Week. From Palm Sunday to Tuesday, Jesus and his disciples spend much of each day at the temple, and there is much teaching taking place on these days. Traditionally and historically, Wednesday of the Passion Week has been called Silent Wednesday. This is because the scripture doesn't say much about Wednesday outside of the preparation being made for the Passover. While Jesus and his disciples remain in Bethany for a last time of fellowship, and perhaps for some additional teaching, Judas returns alone to Jerusalem to arrange for his betrayal of Jesus. The scripture suggests that Judas was often sent out on errands as the group's treasurer, so none of the disciples probably thought much of his absence on this day. I'm going to read Luke chapter 22, verses 1 through 6 for you. "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death, for they were afraid of the people. And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the Twelve. And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. They were glad and agreed to give him money. So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd." So here we see Satan at work. In verse 3, we have a very scary verse. Satan himself enters into Judas, one of the Twelve. The chief priests and scribes now had a willing inside man. They did not have to seek out any of the disciples. One of the disciples came to them. So an arrangement was made. Judas Iscariot, a disciple who had been handpicked by the Lord Jesus himself, was going to commit the biggest act of betrayal in the history of mankind. And this almost seems absurd. How could someone so close to Jesus turn on him in such a way? What kind of man was this Judas Iscariot? How sinister, how evil, how foolish must this man have been to do such a thing? So on this silent Wednesday, we're going to spend some time looking at what the Gospel accounts say about Judas Iscariot. So what do we know about Judas Iscariot? First, Judas had stuck with Jesus when most of the crowds turned away from him. Two Sundays ago, Pastor Peter preached out of John 6, where Jesus said that he was a bread of life. He told the crowds that he was the destination and not just the means. And in him was life. In him was eternal life. He was eternal life. And he did not come to fill their bellies. He was God incarnate. And Jesus' teachings started getting very hard to listen to and to understand. And at these hard teachings, most of the crowds withdrew and stopped walking with Jesus. But Judas stayed. And let me read for you the end portion of John 6. As a result of this, many of his disciples withdrew and were not walking with him anymore. So Jesus said to the twelfth, "You do not want to go away also, do you?" Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God." Whether it was only head knowledge or simply lip service, I'm sure at this point in time, this also was Judas' verbal confession. Perhaps he may have only mentally ascribed to these truths, but Judas too publicly confessed Jesus as the bread of life. And he backed up his confession by continuing on with Jesus. Secondly, Judas also had been given spiritual power and authority and had been commissioned to preach. So Judas, like the rest of the twelve, was with Jesus for most of the three years he did his public ministry. Judas not only witnessed and marveled at the miracles of Jesus, he himself performed miracles. He preached, he cleansed the lepers, he cast out demons, he healed the sick, and he perhaps even raised the dead. Matthew 10. Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. Verse 7. "And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons, freely receive, freely give.'" And third, Judas had a trustworthy external appearance. John 12.4-6. "But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who was intending to betray him, said, 'Why was his perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?' Now he said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. And as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it." Here the scripture explicitly tells us that Judas was a thief. But there are a couple of details that I'm hoping that you don't miss first. Judas, amongst the disciples, is usually the one making mention of the poor. And Judas often says the right things. Second, he is a keeper of the money box. Notice it wasn't Matthew, the tax collector. Usually when we appoint or designate someone to handle a group's finances, we usually put the money into the hands of the one we deem most trustworthy. And it does not seem the other disciples had a problem with Judas being in charge of the finances because they trusted him. So what do we know about Judas Iscariot? One, he was a man who stuck with Jesus when most of the crowds had distanced themselves from him. Two, he was one who had been given spiritual authority and power to preach and to teach and perform miracles. And third, he was a man trusted by the eleven other disciples. So here we have to go into a little preview of tomorrow's, Thursday's events because we learn much more about the reputation of Judas Iscariot that he had with the rest of the disciples. So I'm going to briefly walk you through the 13th chapter of John and Jesus' interactions with Judas at the Last Supper. If you have your Bibles with you, I would encourage you to follow along as I quickly work through the details of John 13. The verses will be put up there for you, but you can fill in more gaps with your eyes if your Bibles are open. So John 13. Beginning in John 13 10, Jesus says four times that one of the twelve will betray him. Four times. And it is not obvious to a single person among them that Jesus was speaking about Judas Iscariot. Four times Jesus speaks of being betrayed by one of the twelve, and no one has a clue who he's talking about. Here's the first time, John 13 10 to 11. Jesus said to him, "He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you. For he knew the one who was betraying him. For this reason he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'" Jesus just got done washing the disciples' feet, and there's nothing written about him skipping the washing of Judas' feet. So we can assume that he washed Judas' feet as well. The second time in verse 18, Jesus is a little bit more explicit. "I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'" And if they did not get it the first two times, Jesus says a third time in verse 21. And this time his spirit is troubled. And judging from the response of the disciples, my guess is at this time, there is now more emotion in his voice. Verse 21, "When Jesus had said this, he became troubled in spirit and testified and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me.'" So the disciples are now perceiving that Jesus is a bit upset. So they begin murmuring to one another. And you know what's absolutely crazy here is they still have no idea who he's talking about. Verses 22 to 25, "The disciples began looking at one another at a loss to know of which one he was speaking. And there was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved. So Simon Peter gestured to him and said to him, 'Tell us who it is of whom he is speaking.' And he," presumably John, "leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom said to him, 'Lord, who is it?'" They had Judas there. He was beyond demon-possessed. He had spent time being influenced by Satan himself. In fact, in Luke's account, which you read in the beginning, it says that Satan had already entered into Judas. So Judas was beyond demon-possessed. He was beyond unclean spirit-possessed. He was perhaps Satan-possessed. And the other disciples have no idea that Judas is the one that Jesus was talking about. In fact, my guess is that he was the last one they would have suspected because they're second-guessing themselves. In Matthew 26, each of them is deeply grieved at this and each takes a turn asking Jesus, "Surely not I, Lord?" And this brings us to Jesus' fourth time speaking of his betrayal in verses 27 to 30. After the morsel, Satan then entered into him, Judas. And therefore Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly." Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose he had said this to him. For some were supposing because Judas had the money box that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast or else that he should give something to the poor." So after receiving the morsel, he went out immediately and it was night. I want to read verse 28 again for you. Now no one of those reclining at the table knew. The Greek word is "oudes." Not one person among them, "oudes." I have about six or seven children's Bibles at home. In all of them, you kind of know who Judas Iscariot is early on. He's the one with the scowl on his face. He's the one looking like he's up to no good. He's the one kind of standing off to the side. But in reality, he is so well put together that no one has an idea that Judas would be Jesus' betrayer. He's the last person they'd suspect. My guess is that he was a warm and jolly fellow. Very joyful perhaps. He may even have been the disciple whom Jesus corrected or rebuked the least. Even after Jesus says four times, the disciples still think that Judas was just being sent out on an errand. No one was suspecting him and saying, "Hey, where were you yesterday? You went alone to Jerusalem. What did you do there?" "Oudes." Not one person among them. So what does this teach us? First, that man's spiritual vision is horrible. Why does God tell the prophet Samuel not to judge by the outward external appearance? Because you and I are easily tricked and deceived. We read in 2 Corinthians 11.14 that Satan, and I would assume his cohorts, can appear as angels of light. So in our flesh, and naturally, we walk by sight and not by faith. So on Silent Wednesday, Jesus was betrayed by the last person his disciples would ever have suspected. Judas himself possibly had never imagined that he could be capable of such a thing. And what a sobering thought. There exists in every single one of us qualities of Judas Iscariot. And here are some positive ones. A commitment that perseveres to some degree. A good repute in the sight of many. The ability to say right-sounding things at the right time. And perhaps even varying degrees of spiritual talent, ability, and possibly even power. And here's a not-so-positive one quality. Exchanging an eternal relationship with the Son of God for 30 pieces of silver. So here is a sobering question to ask yourself. Is there some Judas betrayer in me? If it were not for the grace of God, Judas' story could very well be our story. Had it not been for the grace of God, our demise would have been no different from Judas'. We were all asked a question a few weeks ago. Is Christ the destination? Is he merely a means? And I want us to turn to that passage. And I'm going to take our attentions back to John chapter 6 because Judas is mentioned there. In Judas' story, we see the end result of someone for whom Jesus was only the means and not the destination. And I'm going to read John 6, 64 to 65. It says, "But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. And he was saying, 'For this reason I have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted him from the Father.'" And John 6 tells us that for Judas, Christ was the means. And at the end of the day, Judas was disappointed with the means of Christ. That's perhaps why he is so indignant when Mary breaks open the alabaster jar of costly perfume. Yes, in Matthew 26 it says he's indignant. And perhaps that was the last straw for Judas. Jesus had known from the very beginning, it says in John 6, what Judas would eventually do. And yet, Jesus invited him in. And I can't presume to know how Jesus must have felt every day interacting with Judas. But it's not hard to imagine that he loved Judas the same as he had loved the other disciples. He treated Judas the same. And it would not be out of character for Jesus to also tenderly have washed Judas' feet the same way. And why do I believe this? Jesus, the radiance of the Father's glory and the exact representation of his nature, he too loves his enemies. And we serve a God who is able to love his enemies. We serve a God who would give his life for his enemies. And that's what this week is about. Romans 5, 6 through 8. For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. But God demonstrates his own love towards us. And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. But God demonstrates his own love for us. In that while we all were just as capable of betrayal, like Judas, Christ died for us. This is what we are celebrating this week. This is what we are reflecting on this week. Were it not for the grace of God and Christ's work on the cross and the power of his resurrection, our judgment would be no different from Judas's. So on this silent Wednesday, may Judas's life and example and betrayal humble us. May it sober us up. May Judas's life serve as a reminder for you and me to value Christ as our destination and not simply as our means. Let's pray together. Lord, when we see and when we take an examination of our hearts, more often than not, we're disturbed by the ugliness that we see. And it is our confession, Lord, that there is nothing good in us outside of Jesus Christ. There is nothing lovable in us. There is nothing desirable in us outside of Christ. Yet you died. Yet you loved. And yet you served. I pray that this week would cause us to be humble. It would cause us to be joy-filled and thankful. It would cause us not to harbor grudges or resentment, to point to the unfathomable love of God. Thank you, Lord, for loving those who were hostile to you. We who were once enemies now stand as children who delight in the presence of their Father. We give you the praise that you're due. Thank you. We pray this in Jesus' name.  Mercy reigns. And I will die. River of blood, streams of grain, I'll drink them all. All the love I've ever found, like a flood flowing down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you. Where your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to you. I owe all to you, Jesus. There's a place, sin and shame, I will lay. Where my heart is at peace with God, I give them. All the love I've ever found, like a flood flowing down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you. Where your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to you. I owe all to you. Here my hope. Here my hope is found. Here on holy ground. Here I bow down. Here I bow down. Here arms open wide. Here you save my life. Here I bow down. Here I bow down. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you. Where your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to you. I owe all to you. At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in all of you. I'm in all of you. Where your love ran red and my sin washed white, I owe all to you. I owe all to you, Jesus. Amen. Let's pray together. Father, we reflect and meditate on your incredible love. God, all through this week, we recognize truly how patient your love is, truly how powerful your love is. God, we are reminded, every single one of us, Lord, we are so stained with sin. And God, at depths of which we keep seeing as we live. And God, we recognize that should we be given the chance, so to speak, it very well, the aspect of that kind of betraying selfishness that exists in every single one of us. But we are so thankful, Lord, that you redeem. We are so thankful, God, that you transform. And God, you are changing those who were in it. And through your gospel and through your salvation, you are presenting us blameless. Father, that truth is so astounding. And we thank you for it over and over again. I do pray again that every single one of us, all the brothers and sisters at our church, will continue to walk down the path of recognizing and seeing truly how deep and extensive your love is. And God, that your love would grip us, Lord, and that your love is, Father, the power that's causing us to be walking in faithfulness to you. We thank you, Lord, and again devote both our song, our attention, and our faith to you. It's in Christ, and we pray. Amen. Have a good night, everyone.                     Thanks for watching.</p></div></body></html>
