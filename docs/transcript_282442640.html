To drink juice or to have faith in God. What do you think she chose, everybody?  That's right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, cheer on your contestants as we prepare for the final event of day four. We have, in lane one, Kevin Sysavage from Koala!  Kevin Sysavage, yeah!  In lane two, we have Mark from Square Antonio!  In lane three, we have Kinshala from Wakanda!  And, last but not least, we have Anna Banana from Korea!  Who will win? Let's find out. So, today's event is going to be the pool little javelin throw. Each contestant will line up. First, we have Kevin Sysavage from Koala!  He's javelining. How far will he throw it?  He's going. He's going. And he throws! Wow! 100 feet! How amazing! Next, in lane two, we have the representative from Square Antonio. She's walking up to the plate and whoo! So average!  At lane three, we have Wakanda!  And that was a great try! Now, last but not least, Fabio!  Aww! What a giant effort she made. So, there you have it. In first place, we have the Koalas. Second place, we have Square Antonio. And in third place, we have Wakanda. No fair! We should have won! I drank two of those juices! Yeah, me too! Guess what? I drank three of the juices! Two of them! Two of them! What juice? What is juice? Wakanda forever! I did my best, but I still lost. I trusted in God instead of the juice and yesterday, how come I didn't win? Don't worry. God has a plan for everything. And if we believe in Him, then He will deliver us from our sin. Okay, whatever, Kiwi Seaweed and Anna Banana. Yeah, Kiwi Seaweed, Anna Banana.  Don't worry, Briggs. I, although we're from different places, I stand with you. And I know, with you and God. And I know that although you didn't win, God has a plan for us. And that He will win the final battle. God, I trust in you. Will you please deliver us? Strong! Rampant! The blood will make you stand and fall! Fallen can raise up strong! Harker! With the sting of the whip on my shoulder, With the salt of my sweat on my brow, Elohim, come high, and you hear your people cry, "Let us now, this dark hour, Deliver us, deliver us, deliver us, For the Lord will remember us Here in His burning sand. Deliver us, there's a land you promised us, Deliver us to the promised land."  Attention, attention, everybody. We just took an unauthorized blood sample and discovered illegal substances in the following countries. Scrantonia and the Quallens have been disqualified. Therefore, the winner is Berea and Wakanda. Congratulations!    Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and praise be to our God. No! We cheated! We cheated fair and square!  Genius! Wait, what? Wait, you haven't heard the last of us. Let's go, boys. Thanks, Kiwi. Thanks for teaching me and reminding me to trust in God and not the Jew sin. Jesus delivered us from our sins, and if we have faith in Him, then He'll deliver us from our evil deeds. Yeah, God does always win. But what if I don't trust in God? You know, God sent Jesus to us for a reason, so that we could go to heaven and be with God. But if we don't believe in Jesus, then we're going to go to hell. But nobody wants you to go there, so that's why Jesus is our only option. And as the world turns, so do the tables turn. Those who are last are now first. Tomorrow, we will have the finale, where there will be a very special surprise. So stay tuned. Raise your pointer finger up high if you think you know what will happen next, and put it over your mouth and save it until tomorrow. Have a great night, everybody!</p></div></body></html>
