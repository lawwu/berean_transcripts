Okay, perfect. All right. Good morning, everyone. My name is David Kim, and I'm a girl dad, a husband/servant, photographer, cheerleader, social media manager, and whatever my wife says I am, to my wife, Tessia. But most importantly, I'm a sinner saved by grace and adopted into the family of God. Before I continue with the rest of this testimony, I just want to put a disclaimer out there. If any part of this testimony speaks to you, and if it convicts anybody, that's from God. If I totally botch it, and it just goes all kinds of haywire, and nobody knows what I said, that was all me. So all glory to God, all the mistakes come down to me. So I just want to put that out there first. But anyways, thank you for taking the time to hear my testimony and witnessing my baptism. I know most of you didn't really have a choice and didn't know this was even happening, but I appreciate you guys patiently suffering with me in the next few minutes all the same. I became a follower of Jesus Christ in 2001, after I watched the Billy Graham crusade on TV with my father. I prayed with my father, who was a missionary and still is, and accepted Christ that day. And yes, I'm an MK, and that also means I have all sorts of underlying issues, and that's just the nature of the beast. But I should also get out of the way that I also received a sprinkle baptism and was never fully baptized through full immersion. So although I did accept Christ, I never, just purely out of ignorance, never received a full immersion. To continue, after that day, I pursued God, or more accurately, God pursued me. I found a strong community within my church and experienced God's love through my friends and the pastors that God placed in my life. In my third year at school, however, I grew lazy and began hardening my heart towards God's voice. I don't have an epic, traumatic story here. Instead, I simply stopped praying and reading the word as often as I used to. And the change was so subtle, but dangerous. And over time, I simply forgot how good God is, just like the Israelites repeatedly did after their exodus from Egypt. And I began to ask, "Is Jesus really all I need in life?" I'll save you the time and the pain of discovering the answer to that question for yourself, and I'll tell you, the answer is absolutely yes. I can confidently say, as someone who got to travel all over the world through the military and just through some interesting experiences, met all kinds of people, nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing can even come close to the love of Christ. At the time, when I was struggling, even though I thought I was free in a worldly sense, I was pretty miserable, and I often joked that I even couldn't get sinning right because I always felt like something was holding me back. So I was a terrible Christian, and I was a terrible sinner. So that kind of tells you how conflicted I was back then. I didn't know it then, but today I know it was the Holy Spirit relentlessly pursuing and protecting me as part of His mission to complete the good work He began in me, as stated in Philippians 1.6. Now today, as my wife and I transition out of the military life, God continues to remind us of His goodness, His holiness, and providence every single day. He continues to be faithful and takes care of us in so many ways that I can't even begin to cover in this short testimony. We'll just have to get to know each other for that one. But as I navigate this next chapter in my life, I look forward to seeing how God will be glorified in my life and the lives of those around me, that's you guys, and I really look forward to seeing the types of miracles and the blessings that He brings upon us. Thank you for listening to my testimony, and I pray that you are blessed by the rest of this service.</p></div></body></html>
