class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=22s">00:00:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's hard to know what life was like without knowing God because all my life I felt that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=27s">00:00:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God was always there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=29s">00:00:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I was raised in a Christian household.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=31s">00:00:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">My mom would take us to church every Sunday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=34s">00:00:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We'd have nightly Bible studies and we'd pray every night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=39s">00:00:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I grew up with friends and family who were Christian and it felt like I was surrounded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=43s">00:00:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">by God's love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=46s">00:00:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">During this time I remember absorbing all the things from church and the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=50s">00:00:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">my mom was teaching me and I took them as truth because that was the only thing I knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=56s">00:00:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I was challenged though early on that I had to make my faith my own and that this can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=62s">00:01:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just be second-handed for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=65s">00:01:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But even with that, naturally I'm just a very obedient person and I like to please my parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=70s">00:01:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and so even making faith my own felt a little forced as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=77s">00:01:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">However there were times though growing up in middle school, high school where I felt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=81s">00:01:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">convicted by the gospel and God's gift of salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=87s">00:01:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember at a retreat I thought that I felt God's love and the idea of Jesus sacrificing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=94s">00:01:34.400</a></span> | <span

really open to just sin in my life and what Jesus did on the cross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=106s">00:01:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As growing up I didn't really see my own sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=110s">00:01:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought just because I grew up in a Christian household that I was inherently saved but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=115s">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that was far from the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=119s">00:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was a sinner and I was against God and just because I may have grew up set apart I still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=129s">00:02:09.560</a></span> | <span

of shown throughout high school where at my home church things changed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=140s">00:02:20.160</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=146s">00:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of scripture and Bible and I knew that this was wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=149s">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew that at this church I wasn't being spiritually fed and the only reason why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=154s">00:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stayed was because of the friends that I had made since childhood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=158s">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so even because of this I still continued to stay and I didn't even pursue God on my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=163s">00:02:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=167s">00:02:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Before I knew that as humans we would sin and I always thought that even though I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=173s">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a sinner God's grace, he forgives us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=177s">00:02:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though that's true I neglected the importance of genuine repentance and fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=181s">00:03:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">surrendering myself to Jesus and that would break the cycle of sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=186s">00:03:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So in college I started going to Bible teaching church but I failed to really integrate myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=194s">00:03:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the community and so each Sunday I would just go receiving head knowledge of the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=199s">00:03:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the scripture but never actually applying it in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=204s">00:03:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't until I came to Verion just this year was that I really felt convicted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=210s">00:03:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by what God was telling me that before God I stand before righteous God and that I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=220s">00:03:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">fully just and through his son's sacrifice that I can now have that relationship with</span></div><div

talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=232s">00:03:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to God is not just someone I'm speaking out just randomly or blindly but I now have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=238s">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship with him and that has been restored through Jesus' sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=243s">00:04:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So from that I really started to see fruit in my life where I didn't see before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/530196006#t=250s">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I have a need to spread the gospel whenever I can to any unbelieving friends or family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
