href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=48s">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would illumine your word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=51s">00:00:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=54s">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I pray that if in our inner being, in our thoughts, in our emotions, in any way, Lord God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=58s">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's anything that is crooked before you, we pray, Father, that your word would enlighten us, strengthen us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=64s">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">empower and sanctify us, Lord God, for the sake of your name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=67s">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Jesus' name we pray, amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=70s">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so let's look at Isaiah chapter 52.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=76s">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so the first question of last week was, chapter 52 begins with the third awake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=84s">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the three separate passages, chapter 51, 9, and 17, and 52, 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=91s">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the similarities, what are some things that you found, and obviously those three things kind of ties the passages together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do they teach?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=104s">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So each one of these calls to awake, and then it's followed by be strengthened or to stand up, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=110s">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning God's about to do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=113s">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It means to pay attention, that God's going to bring revival, he's going to be bringing rebuke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=117s">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in other words, to whatever it was that was status quo, it should no longer be, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=125s">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what he means by awake, to stand up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=128s">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, we see the same language in the New Testament, where God is calling his church to be reawakened, to no longer be lukewarm, and he says to awake, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first call to awake in 51, 9, it's awaken of the servant for the Lord's action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=146s">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically saying that this is what the Lord is about to do, so awake and pay attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously that's in preparation for what he's about to tell us, that all the promises that he's made is going to be fulfilled in the servant that's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=161s">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first awaken is, awaken and pay attention because he's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=173s">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second awaken is a reminder to Israel of their past sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is a consistent pattern that we see. Whenever God moves, he first brings awareness of their sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You see now? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=214s">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, there's a consistent pattern that we see over and over again, that before God brings revival, that revival basically is recognizing their sin and Jesus Christ as a solution to their sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=225s">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they don't recognize the sin that they're under, the judgment that they're under, then when Christ comes, what purpose would he serve?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that's a constant pattern that we see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we're praying for revival, you know, I mean, oftentimes the churches get together and we pray for revival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Revival basically is asking God to take a close look at your heart and your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=246s">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because until there is confession of sin, there is no revival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=250s">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, when we pray for revival, we're praying for revival for other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=254s">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord, convict them, convict those people. But really, revival is praying that God would come and reveal your inner being and who you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because that's the reason why he comes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the second awaken is awaken so that you would be aware of the wrath of God, but the solution that he's about to bring with his servant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=273s">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the third call is a promise of restoration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=276s">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Lord is about to move. The Lord is coming because of your sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=281s">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally awake because the Lord is coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=284s">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=285s">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at chapter 52, it begins by saying, Awake, put on your strength, O Zion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=294s">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Put on your beautiful garments of Jerusalem, the holy city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=297s">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the idea, the imagery of putting on a beautiful garment represent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=303s">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When would you put on a beautiful garment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=312s">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=313s">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Funeral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=315s">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Funeral. You just ruined it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=317s">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just nullified it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=319s">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=328s">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of like after you take a bath, you're able to put on new clothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't put it on when you're dirty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=334s">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it says, put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/172858011#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.</span></div><div
