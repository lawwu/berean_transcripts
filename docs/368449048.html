which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=112s">00:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">makes sense of the suffering, the persecution, his current

sacrifice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=164s">00:02:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy

this, he is talking about his entire worldview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=181s">00:03:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which says, "My joy is to have Christ exalted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=187s">00:03:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether in life or by death, if

expound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=201s">00:03:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">upon his goal, that what he wants is to know the power of his resurrection, Jesus' resurrection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=207s">00:03:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the fellowship of his

that he may obtain the power of the resurrection of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=216s">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you recall, the way I summarized it was, all the way Jesus, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=220s">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to know every part of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=223s">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I do this review with you guys because the section that we're at now is an exhortational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=231s">00:03:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">section that summarizes a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=235s">00:03:55.080</a></span> | <span

lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, therefore, we had to do a little bit of a review, thinking through all the various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=250s">00:04:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">perspectives and worldview that Apostle Paul has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=253s">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I would like to make a quick comment about Bible study, that sometimes when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=259s">00:04:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">come across an exhortational passage like this, you can still do very close observations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=265s">00:04:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're asking the questions about, "What does he mean by obtain?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=269s">00:04:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Why does he say obtain when this is stuff that we are given as a gift?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=274s">00:04:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=275s">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Why does…</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=276s">00:04:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We should do that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=277s">00:04:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the exhortation was pretty clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=280s">00:04:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's repetitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=281s">00:04:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really repetitive, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=283s">00:04:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, these are moments when you should be thinking, "Hmm, this is highly applicational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=289s">00:04:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I conceptually understand what he wants me to apply?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=293s">00:04:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And when he uses these words, do I understand what they mean, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=299s">00:04:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I thinking like Apostle Paul in this?"</span></div><div

way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=305s">00:05:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in my own life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we as a community understand how this should be applied?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=314s">00:05:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the thought should really meditate upon application and to understand, "Do I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=321s">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even what and how I'm supposed to apply this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=325s">00:05:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in thinking about that, okay, in thinking about that, I want us to now read the passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/368449048#t=331s">00:05:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's turn to our little packet of hand out there,
