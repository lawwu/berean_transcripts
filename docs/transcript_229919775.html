Have you seen this man? We are proud to announce that Peter Kim, a former Samsung user, who was notorious for taking terrible selfies, has finally improved at a genuine iPhone. Now he can confidently take pictures and selfies at any beret event. And that's why Apple doesn't advance it.   Last time on Adventures of Spork and Gorg. Spork was plugged into a docking system, forgetting her mission to spread the gospel, while nemesis of Genesis betrayed Mrs. Samsung. Meanwhile, Captain Gorg tried to wake up Spork. Spork, what's up? Come on. Oh my gosh, Gorg. The weirdest thing happened when I was synced in. I was like forgetting who I was and what I was supposed to be doing. I just really want to go home. Wait, we still need to spread the gospel. Maybe we can sync the information into the other iTunes. I have my Bible app, and we can install it for them. I feel like God is calling us to stay here and reach outside to us. I mean, I guess it doesn't matter to me. We might as well try, right? Do or do not. There is no try. I think we should just go home. It's safer there. You can just spread the gospel there. Dear God, I know that you love me even when I make wrong choices. There are so many things that I'd rather do than trust in you and follow your word, but I know that you are a God of the visible and the invisible, so help me to trust you more. Amen. Everyone, let's pray to help Spork. Repeat after me. God loves you. Even if you do wrong. God loves you. Even if you do wrong. Thanks, Pastor Spork, for all you guys. I feel so much better, and I think I can trust in God more. As Spork prayed, or after Spork prayed, God told her to go spread the gospel to new nations. So, Spork and Kork boarded the ship. And Spork and Kork decided to go back home, but little did Spork and Kork know that the nemesis of Genesis was also on their ship, plotting to sabotage their mission.   Now, all I have to do is hop their ship so they're going to get hit by asteroids. What's going on with our ship? I don't know, but it's not steering. Kids, throw your asteroids on stage.  Get us out of here! Use that one thing. What's it called? Use the Force! Do it! You didn't do it, Dad! You didn't do it, Mom! Use the Force! Oh, yeah. Help us, Jesus! You're our only hope! After they prayed, Spork and Kork crashed onto a new planet. Thank you, God, for saving us. Yeah, thanks for destroying that last asteroid right at the last second. Seriously, we can only see what's visible, but God always reveals more than what we can see. And after that, Spork and Captain Kork landed on the harsh desert of Tatooine. Tatooine! Tatooine! Where are we? It looks like we've landed on... Tatooine. What are those? I don't know, but I think-- First things first, I'm fearless! I'm the meanest in the world, yeah! And I'm all up in shaky business, I'm gonna beat you down, 'cause I'm really the meanest, uh! J-A-B-B-A, put my name in the-- Attack!  I'll join! I'll join! Help me! Join our forces. Yes, where's the food?  Good job, Jabba! I knew your minions would do my bidding. Good thing I texted you. You are evil. You are definitely evil.  But what are you going to do to me? Your lack of faith is disturbing. You will never, ever be able to share the gospel again. No! I don't want to!  And muhahaha, they did it. Will a Corgi's fork escape the hands of Jabba and Nemesis? Will Pastor Peter buy another iPhone? Come tomorrow to find out on the Adventure Zone. Corgis for more!</p></div></body></html>
