another seven, and another seven, 21 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=61s">00:01:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">consecutively, or seven

href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=74s">00:01:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's just talking about different aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=78s">00:01:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way we approached it, the way I approached it, is that on the seventh one, it opens up</span></div><div

interpretation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=88s">00:01:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm not going to go through all of it for the sake of time, but remember there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=93s">00:01:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">different approaches to this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=97s">00:01:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on your perspective on how you interpret this, everything that we studied, the application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=101s">00:01:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to look very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=103s">00:01:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one of the applications or the interpretation was that you would interpret it in a way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=108s">00:01:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">everything was fulfilled in the first century, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=112s">00:01:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody remember what that view was called?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=116s">00:01:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The preterist view, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=118s">00:01:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The historical view is the application of historical, certain historical events all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=123s">00:02:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout from the very first century until now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=126s">00:02:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the historical view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=127s">00:02:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we are calling, it's called the futurist view, meaning that most of this stuff is meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=132s">00:02:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to be applied at the end times when Christ comes, during the tribulation, during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=137s">00:02:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">millennium, and at the very end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=139s">00:02:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was our approach, if you guys remember, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=143s">00:02:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to go over 22 chapters, so it's going to be pretty quick, alright?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=148s">00:02:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'm going to give you guys the rest of the time to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=150s">00:02:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you remember, chapter one begins with the introduction, and verse three, it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=155s">00:02:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">"Blessed are those who read," again, this is not the exact quote, "or hears and keeps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=159s">00:02:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the prophecy of this book of Revelation."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=161s">00:02:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the emphasis was not just to read it, not just to hear it, but to obey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=166s">00:02:46.460</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=170s">00:02:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">ends with it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=171s">00:02:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">"Blessed are those who obey," or keep this word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=174s">00:02:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when we think about the various prophecies that we studied, it wasn't just so that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=179s">00:02:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">can look at it and say, "Oh, now I understand the end times," but how does that cause us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to obey, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=185s">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's what it started with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=187s">00:03:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, the very first vision that he has is the vision of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=191s">00:03:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christ is the one who calls John to give him the vision so that he can take it to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=195s">00:03:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=196s">00:03:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, chapter one begins with a detailed description of who Christ is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/246863441#t=202s">00:03:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter two and three gives us the seven different churches, right?</span></div><div
