Please know that all the normal inductive study methods you apply, it still is going to glean for you these various observations, and you can just share that and the questions you have. But specifically for this, I asked if you can discuss, because, you know, kind of the nature of the chapter we read was so intense, talk about the tone, talk about, you know, the repeated idea, and where is the emphasis in the chapter, etc.</p><p>But also, number three, make observations and detailed questions about what's the difference as a comparison of the covenant of old and a new covenant of promise. Okay? So go ahead and take some time to discuss. At eight o'clock, we'll be back for teaching time. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're in the book. of text of text.</p><p>And you're in the book, And you're in the book, chapter 29 to chapter 33, embedded into the heart of Jeremiah, is a beautiful segment on God's mercy and future plans for the nation of Israel, okay? However, how many of you guys have heard this one? It says, this whole land will be a desolation, a horror, and these nations will serve the kings of Babylon 70 years.</p><p>My guess is none of you guys have that placard on the wall or memorized on the tip of your tongues because obviously the tone is so different, okay? So when we study the books of prophecy, part of the reason why I mentioned this idea of you have to know the tone is because the book has a movement that's typically incredibly forceful.</p><p>Why? If you imagine, do you remember a couple sessions ago, I said, imagine you're at the pool and you're the lifeguard, and you see all these kids running around and jumping off where they shouldn't be jumping off and nose diving into stuff and crack their head, right? What would you do?</p><p>And I talked about a meme where this young girl who's a lifeguard just starts screaming, walk, right? Well, I use that analogy again to say, if you imagine the nation of Israel just disobeying every rule there is around the pool, running amok and doing whatever they want, the book of prophecies are often actually interjections of God speaking to his people.</p><p>Listen, you keep doing that, you're going to crack your head. So a lot of the tones of the prophets are something that we have to look out for, and specifically for our book in Jeremiah, Jeremiah, it is heavily confrontational, it's incredibly urgent, and it's pleading for repentance, it's deeply sorrowful and mournful, and what's more, the emotions are so intense that there is this poetic repetition that you guys have already seen in our chapter, but on almost every major movement of this whole book, there is intense emotion through it all.</p><p>For example, look at what Jeremiah says in 9.1, Oh, that my head were waters, my eyes were fountains of tears, that I may weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people. My soul, my soul, I'm in anguish. This is the tone of the whole book, okay?</p><p>The whole book is just repeat of this, and that's why a lot of people, I think, when they read prophecy, they kind of start moving away from reading it. I mean, who wants to read, like, you have to read 29 chapters, an incredible rebuke to get to a beautiful passage like this, right?</p><p>It can be difficult. But coming to just a quick hermeneutical rule again is this. When we read prophecy, you should interpret it as a literal proclamation with a very clear intended message. It's typically a rebuke, call to repentance, a warning, or a word of hope with elements of foretelling of future events.</p><p>Let me take a moment to pause there. Why am I saying this rule? Because if I summarize that, it just says, read it literally. That's it, okay? It's because the common kind of mistake, the common error in looking at prophetic books is you think that there are weird mystical sayings about the future, strange oracles and visions, and weird kind of drama.</p><p>And yes, the book of Jeremiah has tons of them. I believe there are seven movements of different pictures. The reason why earlier I gave you the photo of this is because God made Jeremiah take these jars. And he said, take them. And in front of everybody, start crushing them on the floor.</p><p>But is that like very difficult to understand? Is that so difficult to interpret? The answer is no. There is a clear message behind that. Whether it's you're not listening to me, I have to get your attention, that kind of stuff, okay? So my point in this is, please do not first and foremost look at prophets like difficult fortune telling or foretelling of the future that we'll never know because we're not supposed to know the times or specifically when.</p><p>And that's true. If you keep asking, when is this? When is this? You're coming at it with an expectation where you're not going to get the answer. But if you're coming at it with what is God's word to these people in their moment, it's not only clear, it's so abundantly clear.</p><p>There's drama presentations, reiterations and explanations for them to get the clear message. Okay? All right. With that said, I'm still on this idea of what's the tone? Okay? What is the tone? And for us, understanding the tone of the whole book makes us even appreciate more. How in the world do we jump from, like, you people are not listening to me, like, judgment's coming for you, to this, where God says in Jeremiah 31, I asked you guys to read the whole chapter, where he begins by saying, "The Lord appeared to him from afar, saying, 'I have loved you with an everlasting love.</p><p>Therefore, I have drawn you with loving kindness. Again, I will build you and you will be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel. Again, you will take up your tambourines and go forth to the dances of the merry merry-makers.'" Okay? So in this sense, if we had time, we'd camp out.</p><p>And my exhortation to you is, rather than looking at the book of prophets like, "Oh, those are really difficult books about the future," rather look at them as incredibly, emotionally intense moments of proclamation. And you're supposed to feel it. You're supposed to feel this emotion. Chapter 31 is very repetitive, isn't it?</p><p>The terms of God's love, His kindness, His desire to rebuild, the way that He addresses Israel, and keep this in mind that He's referring to them as a virgin. Okay? It's actually so repetitive. If you read the prophets and you come across repetitions of God's judgment and His wrath, you're supposed to feel it.</p><p>And if you hit moments like this, when we're talking about His word of hope for the people, you have to feel it. Okay? So that would be kind of like the first reading of the text. And then you do a second reading, walking through, and I ask you guys to try and outline chapter 31 if possible, and for sure try to outline our paragraph, verse 27 through 37.</p><p>Okay? Remember, I love outlines. If you did an outline for today, did you really prepare for today? Did you really do a Bible study? The outline process makes you identify where are the thoughts leading to? Okay? What is God's point? It helps you break up this huge chunk in paragraph and say, "Where are the identifiable pieces?" So, let's do a walk through together.</p><p>In the second reading, thinking through, "What are the promises of God?" If this whole tone is, like, essentially, everlasting love and restoration. If the whole tone is love and mercy, what are the promises of God? Here, you will notice that he has this repeated little phrase where it says, "Days are coming.</p><p>Behold the days." Right? And it already kind of tells you the outline. So, in our paragraph from verse 27 to 28, I notice here that he says, "I'm going to sow the house of Israel," and then he explains it. "Just as I watched them and I plucked them and broke them, then I'm going to bring, and to bring disaster.</p><p>So, I'll watch over them to build and to plant." First promise, future replanting and rebuilding of Israel and Judah. Right? I'm sure you guys all got that. The next outline point would be, he says in verse 29, "In those days," and he describes how before the fathers ate the sour grapes and the children felt it.</p><p>And then here he says, "But each man who eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will be set on edge." So, what we notice is, he says, "In the future days, it's not going to be where one man sins and everybody gets judged." Right? It says, "Individual responsibility and consequences." Then, verse 31 through 34, here is the crux of our paragraph and such a beautiful promise of God.</p><p>"Days are coming," he says, "I will make a new covenant." And here you should have all kinds of questions, right? Even though, yes, maybe immediately all your New Testament passages start coming in and all your theology about how did Jesus fulfill this for our sake. I'm going to leave that to you to discuss and to just think about, but we're just going to think about it here.</p><p>It's like, how would the people here, like in this moment, hear this? They've been just told like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe how much of a sinner you are. You have any idea how upset God is with you?" Et cetera, et cetera, right? And then to hear, "God is going to make this new covenant with you." And then, in the second part of that, from verse 33 to 34, he gives the details, and then I'm going to give you this portion as just kind of like my summary of what are the promises of this new covenant.</p><p>And I'm sure you guys identify them as God saying that I'm going to internally transform you, that I will put my law in their heart. That there's going to be a personal, private knowledge of God. At that time, they're going to know me. It's going to be so sweet.</p><p>We don't have to do this like, "Do you understand? Do you understand?" and speak to each other like somebody doesn't know. And what's more, there's going to be forgiveness. A kind of forgiveness where God says, "I will not remember your sins." Amazing, right? My admonition to you is, if again, you thought that the book of prophecy was incredibly difficult, "Oh, I'm not a scholar.</p><p>I can't study the prophets." If that's you, please know like this doesn't take like a degree to just identify. Let me just break it down. What is he promising us? And when we do that, we realize not only is it just simple, he's reiterating them in so many different ways.</p><p>And then finally, in the last segment, okay, in Jeremiah 31:35-37, he starts speaking in such beautiful terms. So long as there is sun fixed order, so long as you're not able to measure the heavens or the foundations of the earth, so long as that's the case, I will never cut off Israel.</p><p>This is a promise that God is not going to be done with them, right? Such assurance, such security. So, the reason why I say this is because again, in your reading through the prophets, there's a sentiment where it's easy, okay? There's a sentiment in which your identification of what his promises are should highlight those very things God wants to emphasize, okay?</p><p>I'm going to give you guys kind of like a couple quick notes again, which is this. I want you guys, as good students of the scripture, to know that there is something kind of plain about studying the scriptures, and it's you being safe. What I mean by that is, what it literally says, allow it to just say, okay?</p><p>If he starts talking about, I'm going to, you know, give the, this nation all these boundaries, go ahead and just think like, that's what he's going to do. If he says, I'm going to raise up this individual and cause him to resurrect, then obviously you're going to be like, that's the guy.</p><p>If there's a forerunner for Jesus, then he's going to be there. Whatever the passage literally says, you can take as like, unless the scripture says otherwise, unless in the context it says otherwise, I'm just going to take it at face value. Okay. The reason why I say this is because, for example, part of the reason why I think sometimes people are fearful of prophecy is because there has been so much historically, even like, even though maybe we're, we're not like accustomed to it here, just across the board, there has been a kind of tendency to, to, to study the passage allegorically.</p><p>What do I mean by this? In our passage in verse 27, to us, it says, when I will sow, oh, sorry, behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel on the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beasts.</p><p>Okay. The typical immediate question is, what does that mean for me? And so did you know that even individuals like John Calvin, if you guys go and use your, you know, BibleStudyTools.com, etc., there's a commentary by Matthew Henry. These individuals made direct correlation from these passages, this text, to us.</p><p>So if you look up this text in their commentary, they'll say, the sowing of Israel is like our modern-day evangelism. God has so desired the seed to go forth and to multiply, and that is the work of evangelism. Whoa. That's a huge jump, isn't it? But if you go to prophecy and you keep wondering, like, what does that mean for me?</p><p>What does that mean for me? You get into error that way. What's more, the seed of beasts, they'll describe as this means the prosperity of the Christian nations. When the scripture is being used to develop, like, the political system, when the scripture is being used to develop the land, there's even going to be prosperity, and that's what he means by the seed of beasts being there as well and being replanted.</p><p>In some sense, that sounds nice, but is that what he's saying? No. He explains himself. Verse 27, verse 28, that as he's watched over the nation of Israel, he's going to watch over them and replant them. Right? Okay. So I want to just kind of highlight for you guys and do a quick pop quiz, right?</p><p>Here, the way that we've been studying the biblical hermeneutics, we said that there is a literal HG hermeneutic. The H stands for historical. Thank you. And the G stands for grammatical. You all fail. Anyway, I'm kidding. Okay. It's a literal historical grammatical hermeneutic. Okay? That's the way that we're trying to read the passage.</p><p>Yes, there's a prophet speaking to the people, but what he's saying is actually literal. Now, what's interesting is people who practice allegorical, like, interpretation will accuse us and say, "Are you saying it's literal? Like, God is literally going to take the nation and plant them?" It's like, no. When we say literal, we mean we take the figures of speech that God employs and uses, and then we take their meaning literally.</p><p>What we don't do is make huge jumps to spiritualize those texts. Okay? So I know I kind of went long there, but I just want you to know, again, one of the primary kind of common errors of studying prophecy and making it difficult is to think, like, what does this mean for me?</p><p>How does this apply now? Et cetera, et cetera. And that makes it tough. Moving forward, we said first reading, pay attention to the tone because it's such an intensely emotional text. Second reading, pay attention to the details of future promise. And don't just make huge jumps to, "That's me.</p><p>That's me. That's me." Okay? Third reading, we want to talk about the historical context. And what is the covenant context? You guys looked at, he has reference to the previous covenant and the immediate covenant. And what I want to say is, okay, so if we see that, we have to give attention to the historical context.</p><p>Just a quick note is this: Jeremiah is speaking to a people who are already being taken captive. Starting from 605 BC down to 586 BC, this is the time where God's judgment is being carried out by the nation of Babylon. Babylon's growing in their power. Assyria is already diminishing.</p><p>And there's waves of people being deported and taken captive. Ultimately, coming down to 586, where Judah becomes destroyed utterly. Okay? This kind of information, it would be difficult just to pick up from reading the book. But you can actually pick it up as you read it. My recommendation is, again, whenever you're studying the Bible, go ahead and take a look at your study Bible.</p><p>Just do a quick search on context, historical context of the book, and you'll realize that this text that we're reading is given to people who are already suffering the consequences of their sin. Take a moment to think about that. Take a moment to think about that and how you appreciate this text.</p><p>Okay? Now, earlier I mentioned that you guys took a look at this and he said that God, or in this passage, Jeremiah highlighted the difference between the old covenant and the new. Okay? But I want you guys to take a moment to appreciate this kind of talk because when we think about prophecy, prophecy actually, in some sense, is what I like to call enforcement of covenant.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Essentially, long ago, the nation of Israel looked at God and said, "God, we love you. Thank you for delivering us. We'll do everything you say." Right? So what did God do? Through Moses, God gave them a covenant, which is often called either the Sinai covenant or Mosaic covenant.</p><p>Right? And God said, "Then this is how you're supposed to walk before me. Walk before me, holy and consecrated. Walk before me, devoted to me, have no other gods." And so the Ten Commandments and all the commandments of the rituals were all for how the people were supposed to be faithful to him.</p><p>It was the rules of their relationship. It was the defining of their walk with God. Okay? When we come to prophecy, a lot of times it's so emotionally intense. It's because see how God feels when the people break that covenant. Jeremiah chapter 3, verse 1-3. Take a moment to follow along in this text with me.</p><p>God says, "If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and belongs to another man, will he still return to her? Will that land not be completely defiled but you? You're a prostitute with many lovers, yet you turn to me, declares the Lord. Raise your eyes to the bare heights and see, where have you not been violated?</p><p>You have sat for them by the roads like an Arab in the desert, and you have defiled the land with your prostitution and your wickedness. Therefore, the showers have been withheld and there has been no spring rain. If you have a prostitute's forehead, you refuse to be ashamed." What he's saying there is that there is this brazenness about their sin.</p><p>To say that you have a prostitute's forehead is actually just saying you have such brazenness, there's no guilt. You just keep doing it in such a rebellious fashion that you have no conviction that that's sin. You have no conviction that's hurting your husband. This is the way the word of prophecy comes.</p><p>And so when we think about it, it's not just a harsh rebuke, it's God calling them and saying, do you understand what covenant relationship we had? Do you remember what as a people you committed to? And then, so now think back, do you remember when I highlighted for God to call them and said, I'm going to rebuild you, O virgin Israel?</p><p>How much they would have heard that and said, oh my gosh. So, I have another passage, but I want to take time to just move forward and say, when we think about prophecy, just to wrap up the third reading, so to speak, and you read that portion, yes, like the prophecies has with it all these details about the future, but keep in mind the context of their relationship now, or now meaning in that text.</p><p>But also keep in mind this idea that covenant was so important to the understanding of this. For God to have a relationship with them, it would be one thing to be like, you know, I'm going to give you common grace like I give everybody else. Do you understand that God is a God who, in His love, desires to define that relationship?</p><p>God is a God who binds Himself. He gives Himself so lavishly, so incredibly fully and thoroughly, that He uses the covenant, that He uses these parameters of a relationship, so that we would know exactly what we can expect from Him. Okay, in thinking about that, the fourth reading you should do whenever you read prophecy is you should be thinking about the character of God, the character of man, and the relationship.</p><p>What do I mean by this is, yes, I mean, again, are these points that I'm giving you so unique to prophecy that you don't do it with other texts? No, this is not like so unique, but precisely because when God speaks in the word of prophetic language, He regularly starts to say, this is my perspective on what you're doing, right?</p><p>That's the kind of picture that I'm trying to highlight for you over and over again, is prophecy is God's introduction of this is how I see you right now. And so whenever He says that, it tells us about Him, right? Typically how holy He is, typically how, you know, methodical He is, how intentionally He is, and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>And I'm going to leave it to you to discuss, especially in the passage that we learned today, what does it tell us about God? Well, I want to highlight for you something that just jumped out from the greater context in chapter 31, verse 20. He says, "Is Ephraim my dear son?" And Ephraim, this part, you know, you can just, most of your Bibles will have like a number, and it'll kind of define, it'll say like, oh, northern Israel, okay?</p><p>It's because the people were already scattered and divided, he has different names for, you know, kind of different sect of the people. But he says, "Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a delightful child?" Indeed. "As often I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him." Like, you gotta just camp out and meditate on that, right?</p><p>To ask like, okay, so clearly God is looking at such a wicked and sinful people. He said, "I'm going to pluck you and destroy you." But then, now he's talking to his prophet, and he's like engaging with him, right? And Jeremiah better be careful, because if Jeremiah goes way too far and be like, "Yeah, you guys are a bunch of losers, you punks, you know?</p><p>God's done with you." Because I started thinking about if I was Jeremiah and hearing all this stuff, I would be tempted to be like, "And you guys are trash. Utter trash." But then God says, "But is Ephraim my son?" He's asking Jeremiah, "Do you understand how I see Ephraim?" And he says, "It's my delightful son.</p><p>I'm going to remember him." Wow. What does that tell us about our God? When God says that he is the heavenly father, he truly is the heavenly father, right? He is going to personally be the one to discipline them, and he's going to personally be the one to restore them.</p><p>So beautiful. And what's amazing about this text is, even though this portion of it's like, "Oh, I have all these plans for you." Remember what I said is, in context, they're experiencing the deportation, and then they're going to experience the destruction, but God says there's going to be a very specific period of time, and no more.</p><p>And just in the same way that my word of judgment against you is going to come exactly, my word of restoration for you will also come perfectly. That's our God. So I want to kind of conclude with that note. If you guys, again, have avoided the books of prophecy because you thought that there would be way too many confusing things, my word to you today is actually it's very, very clear.</p><p>If we ask the right questions about what what is he promising? What are the covenants? And what is his character we're going to glean so much? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for giving such a word of hope to us. God, we know that your word is sure.</p><p>I pray, Lord, that you would help us to believe. We also know, Father God, that just like the nation, we see our own sins, we see how frequently we fail, and we understand, Lord God, how frustrating it can be. But thank you, God, that you give us hope of change.</p><p>You grant to us hope of redemption and transformation. We know you will do a work in us in the same way that you have always done a work in your people. We thank you, God. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay, so next week, we are studying the book of Psalm chapter 27, as we will be hitting the poetry section of the Psalms.</p><p>Also, as a short article, I wrote covenants of the Bible. Okay, so the scriptures has really important milestones of how God used his covenants to give a people the revelation of himself, his promises, or the stipulations of how he wants to relate to the people. I just kind of list for you those biblical references.</p><p>It's not like you have to memorize them and all that kind of stuff, but just know those key milestones because those biblical covenants should dictate how we see God's redemptive history. Okay, I mentioned in there a little bit about how over time, theologians have identified other more theological covenants, but we don't like to use those because those are more like man's summary of the workings of history.</p><p>Rather, we would just like to work off of biblical covenants, okay? All right, here are the discussion questions for you guys. Since they're a little long, I'll explain them a little bit. I do want you to imagine yourself as an Israelite, okay? Hearing Jeremiah just go off, you know?</p><p>What would be your response? But more specifically, if you were the Israelite hearing these words of future promise, but you're looking at your friends and your people getting deported, what do you think your response would be, okay? Number two, uh, we discussed a lot about how the passage today in chapter 31 reveals God's character.</p><p>If you have more observations to share, please share them. But I do also want you guys to think about indirectly, he doesn't say a whole lot about us or the people, but indirectly, what are the things that we can deduce and conclude about the needs of the people and the character of the people.</p><p>Thirdly, meditate and appreciate God's God for the new covenant. We know that the new covenant is supremely better, but continue the discussion on how is it better? Why is it better? And again, just think about like, why is covenant even necessary between God and people? Okay? And then just for fun, do you think God will give Israel a future land?</p><p>Okay? Why or why not? All right. Have a good time and discussion.</p></div></body></html>
