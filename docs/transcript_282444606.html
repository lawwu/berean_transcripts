Competitors are stretching and coming out and getting ready. Meanwhile, the cabbage is savage to coach D'Antonio to try some of their secret drink. Hey, Mike and Dwight from Spantonia, do you want to try some Juicing? Everyone is Juicing. Some people are born with more Juicing than others. It's the only way you can be strong like us. Yeah, we are so full of Juicing. We are so strong. Yeah, don't you want to be strong like us? Of course. Question, how much does this Juicing cost? For you, $10. Only $10? Let's just say it's a steal. Actually, just for you guys, the first one we'll give it to you for free. We gotta go. The race is about to start. What do we do? Mike, nothing is for free. Shh, stop talking. Just give me the Juicing. I want to win. Give it. Okay, as we start and get ready for the next event, we are going to need the children to get off of aisles 3, 4, and 5 for the next event. So if you are sitting in 3, 4, and 5, Scantronians took the Juicing. And now, they are going to prepare for the relay race. We have Boreans on aisle 3. We have the Scantronians on 5. And we have the Koalans on 4. Okay, we will now begin the relay race in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, beep. Okay, we have Scantronians in first place. Now it's the Koalans. And last we have the Boreans. How will this race end up? There goes the Scantronians. Wait, where's Boreans? Boreans lost. Uh oh. We have the Koalans on first, Scantronians on second, Boreans on third. How is this going to end up? We'll never know. Until now. Oh, we have Scantronians on first, Koalans on second, and Boreans on third. So now that we know the place, let's see what's happening. Thanks Koalans, your Juicing gave us extra power. Yeah, thanks. It gave me extra power to beat them. Beats. Yeah, no problem. Hey, what are you guys talking about? We're just talking about how they got second because they drank our juice. Our juice beat your guy. That's not very nice. Hey, you know what, QE? Stop being such a cutie. This is only for winners, okay? Question, why don't you try some of this juice too? You don't want to end up with a friend, do you? Isn't that against the rules? Hey, who cares? Don't you want to be winners like us? Even though we were born with sin, doesn't mean we need to be more sin. We don't need this Juicing. Anna Banana, please don't listen to them. God sent Jesus to us for a reason. Our lives are full of Juicing. Juicing! We are so strong. Juicing! We are so strong! Only the winners on stage. Why don't you go to the front and ask your God for help. Let's go, boys. You want to count? How do I know if I can trust you guys? Do you believe in God? I'm not superstitious. I'm a little superstitious. So, no. What do you guys think? Did I stutter? I'll leave you with this juice, okay? You and your God. You don't want to lose, do you? What do I do? I'm losing this race right now. But I really, really want to win. So, let's test this juice. Juicing! This is so tough. Anna Banana, we can't get rid of our own sin. This Juicing can't get rid of us, either. Only God can. Hey, Anna. Strong! Faster! Strong! We are the champions! We are the champions! We are the champions! Raise up and trot! Faster! With the skin of the winner on my shoulder With the salt of my sweat on my brow And all in the night And you hear your people cry "Let us not destroy the world" Deliver us, deliver all, deliver us For the Lord will never rust In His perfect hand Deliver us, there's a man in the promised land Deliver us, we will follow His plan Kids, who or what should Anna Banana put her faith to? Juice or God? Yell it out! What should she put her faith in? Anna, now I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to trust you. And that's what Anna Banana decided to do. If you didn't hear her, you have to wait until tomorrow to find out. For the final race, will Anna Banana choose the secret power of Juice or God? In John 1.29b, look. The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Find out tomorrow on Korean Olympics!</p></div></body></html>
