Happy New Year, and happy Lord's Day. Romans chapter five, verses three to five, it reads, "And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, "knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance, "and perseverance, proven character, "and proven character, hope. "And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God "has been poured out within our hearts "through the Holy Spirit, who was given to us." With this new year ahead of us, with the many blessings and perhaps trials ahead, may we persevere, may we rejoice, strengthened to know that we have the Holy Spirit with us and the love of God within us.
