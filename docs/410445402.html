Let's begin this Bible study with a word of prayer. Would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=10s">00:00:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you please join me in prayer? Our God, we want to give you thanks for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=17s">00:00:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">precious Word. And God, we know that Lord, when we think about even Apostle Paul, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=24s">00:00:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was praying for the congregation to be strengthened, to have inner strength from faith. And Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=32s">00:00:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">God, we do require that strength as we look into all the instructions and the commands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=38s">00:00:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have for us.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=51s">00:00:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so we pray, Lord, that as you exhort us, as you give to us your Word and instruction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=58s">00:00:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">would we, Father God, continue to find our footing and our strength from you. We thank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=63s">00:01:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you, Lord Jesus Christ, and we pray. Amen. Okay. Well, we are in a transition section</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=72s">00:01:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in our study of the book of Ephesians, as chapters 1 through 3 were clearly just, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=78s">00:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">know, brilliant, or I guess you can say, really majestic, like, doctrine for us to learn about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=84s">00:01:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the grace of God and what the Lord has been doing. I typically like to summarize chapters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=89s">00:01:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 3 like this, "It's God who elects, it's God who saves, and it's God who builds."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=96s">00:01:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? It was--so much of it was just thinking about the ramifications that it has on us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=103s">00:01:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how God has been enacting His mystery, His plan, His administration of our salvation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=109s">00:01:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and redemption over time. And so, what an incredible thing that is for us. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=114s">00:01:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now we're transitioning into, "And therefore, we need to walk." So let's read our section</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=120s">00:02:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of the passage together. And the Scripture says this, "Therefore, I, the prisoner of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=127s">00:02:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=132s">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience showing tolerance for one another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=138s">00:02:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=144s">00:02:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is one body and one Spirit, just as also you are called in one hope of your calling, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=150s">00:02:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=155s">00:02:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all and in all." And we're going to stop there. I know in the previous lesson I had wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=160s">00:02:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">up till verse 7, but I think after studying it more closely, it's good for us to pause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Jumping right into the study, in the very first section or the first verse, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=173s">00:02:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have Apostle Paul giving us this application of command, "Therefore, you need to walk."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=179s">00:02:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "I actually implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the call." Let's break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=184s">00:03:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that down. I gave you a brief just looking at it in section by section. Now if we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=189s">00:03:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">doing a really kind of, I guess you could say, detailed attention study to this, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=194s">00:03:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">could literally break up each one and study it. What we're going to do is more so just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=199s">00:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">overview it, right? Now, because we've been doing the study and last time I did essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=206s">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a review, I'm not going to review chapters 1-3, but here when he says, "Therefore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=212s">00:03:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I the prisoner of the Lord," he has in mind all that's being built up in terms of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=218s">00:03:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">plan. I made much of it the last study that Apostle Paul has in his mind the glory of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=225s">00:03:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">God as it pertains to his masterful plan for his church, right? And when you think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=231s">00:03:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all that, yes, it's inclusive then of Jews and Gentiles coming together. It's inclusive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=237s">00:03:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of our individual salvation, but also it's inclusive of our corporate, what that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=243s">00:04:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at the ramification for the church at large. I believe he has all that in mind, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=247s">00:04:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">important thing is he implores a walk that is worthy of all that. So here, just taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=255s">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a look at that first section, he says, "I implore you." Okay, the term really just means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=261s">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to urge, but in other portions of Scripture it's translated, "I exhort you," right? "I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=268s">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge or strengthen." Now, to add the oomph, so to speak, to add the emphasis to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=274s">00:04:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that, Apostle Paul begins with essentially his authority, but in a unique way where he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=278s">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "I, the prisoner of the Lord." And when he does that, you kind of wonder, like, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=284s">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">certain moments when somebody gives a strong exhortation or commands you to do something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=290s">00:04:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes we could have a reaction where we kind of wonder, like, "Do you know who you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=295s">00:04:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to?" Or more so maybe, "Do you even understand the struggle of trying to do something?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=299s">00:04:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And essentially, Apostle Paul literally and spiritually says, "I am the prisoner of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=303s">00:05:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord," which shows both his experience in doing the very thing that he's commanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but also in many ways the authority of which he's commanding with, right? And we also take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=316s">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a moment to think about this. I have this little sentence here, it says, "As good children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=321s">00:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we should listen well to both doctrine and instruction." And the reason why I wrote that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=325s">00:05:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is because whenever we move into a section that's highly applicational, and there's lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=330s">00:05:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of commands that are going to come one by one, we take a moment to kind of reflect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=336s">00:05:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Are we ready for this?" Right? If we're not ready, then we're gonna just do exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=340s">00:05:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what I just described. Like, "What? Where is this coming from? Do you even know how hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=344s">00:05:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it is? Do you know how much I've already tried? Are you not appreciating how much blood and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=349s">00:05:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sweat I've already put into walking like a Christian?" Right? Like, if we're not ready</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=353s">00:05:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for the instruction, that's how we're going to feel. But if we are ready for it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=358s">00:05:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been paying attention, we've been listening, then we're going to be all the more receptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=364s">00:06:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What's unfortunate is in our modern church history, in recent times, when there was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=369s">00:06:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hyper grace, kind of like, "You don't preach imperatives, you just really have to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=374s">00:06:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching the gospel, and the imperatives will eventually come, you don't even need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=378s">00:06:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to mention it almost." But that doesn't show this receptiveness. Like, you really understood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=383s">00:06:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and therefore you're ready for the application, right? But that's what I'm going to challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=388s">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">us to do. In some circles, it wasn't even kosher to give an urge, right? To give an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=395s">00:06:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">exhortation. But for us, we actually should be receptive of it because we've been listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=402s">00:06:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I'm saying is, in maturity, we should have been listening well to chapters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=405s">00:06:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 3, and what we should be doing is saying yes to both. Yes to the doctrine, yes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=411s">00:06:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to the instruction, and although some of us, maybe we love the doctrinal, right? We love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=416s">00:06:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the doctrinal, we love talking theology, but when it comes to application, it's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=419s">00:06:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "You're not willing to go more forward." This should be a challenge to you. Both are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=425s">00:07:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">required of us. On the flip side, there have been times when people love the practical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=431s">00:07:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They love action. They want to produce something. They want to be a part of a movement, so to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=435s">00:07:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">speak. But when it comes to doctrine, and why, and the theology behind it, it feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=440s">00:07:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so dry. But as for us, again, it's absolutely important for us to know. A huge part of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=448s">00:07:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Word to us is we're supposed to remember, we're supposed to understand, and we're supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=452s">00:07:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to know Him. And we have to think accurately and intimately about God. But also then, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=459s">00:07:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have to apply, and so again, this is just a quick early exhortation that there's a requirement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=464s">00:07:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for us to have a balance of both. That when we're doing our Bible study, I hope we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=470s">00:07:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not looking at the scripture as kind of like, "And how does that matter?" But also, we shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=474s">00:07:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">be looking at it as like, "That's nice, and I'm just simply admiring." Now, next portion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=480s">00:08:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of it, the passage talks about this important concept, a broad concept, that our walk should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=487s">00:08:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called. Now, truthfully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=492s">00:08:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when I think about this term, "manner worthy," instinctually, I know, I think I know and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=497s">00:08:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand. But then, when you take a moment to pause, honestly, something doesn't sound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=502s">00:08:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right. It feels weird, right, to say, "Walk in a manner worthy of this calling," because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=506s">00:08:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">truthfully, how can we? And what's more, worthy? Like, in what way are we worthy of anything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=514s">00:08:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what way are we worthy of God, or His call, or the path that He has set for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=519s">00:08:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">us, right? And what's more, if you think about the English definition of the term "worthy,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=524s">00:08:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked it up, and it says, "Having qualities and abilities that merit recognition." Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=529s">00:08:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so the times that the idea of worth is being used, essentially, you're worth your position,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=536s">00:08:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or you have the merit to hold your position. Or we even have idioms that say, like, "A</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=540s">00:09:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">man is worthy of his wage." Essentially, his work is deserving of that kind of pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=547s">00:09:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when you think about the way that he's using this, obviously, he's not using it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=553s">00:09:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a means of, like, "By your work, you're going to merit some kind of pay." What he's talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=559s">00:09:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about, actually, is reverse. What he's saying is, you have this call. You essentially believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=567s">00:09:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in God's plan and mystery. And you must therefore live worthy of it, meaning, the more biblical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=573s">00:09:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">idea is, worthy is the Greek term axios. And that means worthy, or suitably, or properly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=582s">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a one-to-one match. As a matter of fact, that term then was used, yes, as a scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=588s">00:09:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, you should be thinking about something in balance. Something essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=593s">00:09:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is consistent. And that's the intuitive terms, intuitive understanding that we get, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=598s">00:09:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much the way Scripture uses it through various different contexts. There are so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=603s">00:10:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">times in the Bible, and I have those cross-references for you there that you can look up in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=607s">00:10:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">own time, where the challenge is, you know what's been done for you. You know who he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=612s">00:10:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is. You know who you are. You know what he's doing with you. Therefore, be consistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=620s">00:10:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore be. You need to actually practice what you believe. The consistency for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=625s">00:10:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from going from God's command, our belief, our faith, is called into action. Right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=635s">00:10:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so then, when we think about this, there is a huge challenge. For a lot of us, it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=641s">00:10:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have to go into this pattern where we first have to know why. We first have to have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=646s">00:10:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">motivation, and we first have to have the foundation. However, if we do not move from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=652s">00:10:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there to then walking in a manner that's consistent, then our lives become sarcastic. It becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=660s">00:11:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothetical. Right? It becomes like, if somebody says like, "Oh my goodness, it's so scary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=670s">00:11:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being out there." And then you say, "It's pretty scary." And then you end up going out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=675s">00:11:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there, what ends up happening is your words become pretty sarcastic. Like it could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=680s">00:11:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">taken that way. And the reason why I use that example is because we believe that we should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=684s">00:11:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">be fearing God. And if our words are simply, "I do fear God. He's pretty scary." And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=690s">00:11:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">yet you do every single thing that communicates that you're not afraid of Him, your words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=695s">00:11:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">almost become sarcastic to God. Right? And so whenever we think of our action and our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=702s">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">words in relation to the Lord, we really have to be careful. Our yes is yes, our no is no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=709s">00:11:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and all those consistencies matter. Why? Because it really reveals what we believe about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=713s">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord. Okay. So in summary of that first point, it's our life as being fitting, is being consistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=722s">00:12:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to the righteousness, truth, and love that we have received, the gospel we have received.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=727s">00:12:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Moving to the second point. Apostle Paul, in his challenge now, and saying, "I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=735s">00:12:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially implore you to walk in a manner worthy of a calling," he says that it should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=744s">00:12:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">be done with certain character trait and manner. Okay. So he says, "With all humility and gentleness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=751s">00:12:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with patience, showing tolerance for one another, and love, being diligent to preserve the unity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=756s">00:12:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of the spirit and the bond of peace." Okay. Now, again, we could just pause here and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=764s">00:12:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a full one hour study of just these two verses, verse two and three. But what we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=769s">00:12:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to just do is walk through these character traits and the manners. And the way I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=774s">00:12:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this is because in verse one, Apostle Paul said, "I want you to walk in a manner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=779s">00:12:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's worthy." Let's take a moment to think about these character traits, the humility,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=784s">00:13:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the gentleness, and so forth, in a kind of evaluative way where we ask the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=791s">00:13:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"Is this pattern worthy of the gospel? Is it worthy of what we believe?" What I mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=796s">00:13:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by this is, let's take a list of all these things, all humility, gentleness, and patience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=802s">00:13:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and ask the question, "Is it consistent to what we believe in Christ and the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=806s">00:13:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been taught in chapters one through three?" Let's first think about humility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=811s">00:13:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Humility. Now, when we think about humility, a lot of times it's just to think like you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=818s">00:13:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">not -- a lot of times people describe humility in a negative term, meaning you're not bombastic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=825s">00:13:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you're not all like pomp, and you're not all about bragging, okay? Something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=829s">00:13:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Or you're not all about thinking that you're the best, right? And essentially, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=835s">00:13:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">humility is to think properly. That comparison to you and God, you're tiny. God is massively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=842s">00:14:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">infinitely huge, and you're just a finite being, right? You're tiny. That, in a sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=847s">00:14:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is humility. But when we think about the opposite side, again, in contrast, we realize that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=853s">00:14:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">living in pride is absolutely unworthy of God. What do I mean? Okay. If I believe, according</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=861s">00:14:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the book of Ephesians, that I was dead, completely dead in my transgressions, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=868s">00:14:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what's more, I was super far from God. I wasn't even close. I wasn't even as close as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=873s">00:14:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people of the Hebrews, right? And yet, and yet I currently now think I deserve a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=880s">00:14:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more. And yet I think, like, where are my rights? It's inconsistent. To know that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=888s">00:14:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">in transgression, like the rest, like everybody else, to know that I was in such -- to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=893s">00:14:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm in transgression is I was out of line, and I was wrong, but my normal way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=897s">00:14:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">speech is, "You're wrong, you're wrong, and you're wrong." Right? "You're unfair, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=901s">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not righteous, everybody else is to blame but me." That kind of self-preservation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=908s">00:15:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely unworthy of God. It's unworthy because that kind of self-preservation continues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=913s">00:15:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to preserve the flesh, and it does not preserve Christ. It does not preserve the truth that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=918s">00:15:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been told, and that now we believe in. That kind of pride, again, is unworthy. What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=923s">00:15:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">more, that's a self-preserving pride, okay? Self-preserving pride. What's more, if I believe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=931s">00:15:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">according to Ephesians 2, that I have been saved apart from my works, it is by the grace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=937s">00:15:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, and it's not my deeds, it's not because of the things I have done, and yet, and yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=944s">00:15:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">my ambition is, "Look at what I've done!" Right? "Look at my success!" And yet, my regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=950s">00:15:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern of speech is, "Compared to you, I've done so much more!" Right? Completely inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=956s">00:15:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's unworthy of the kind of gospel we have received. Why? Because that kind of self-exalting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=963s">00:16:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pride promotes our vanity rather than Christ. Let me repeat that. Anytime we're sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=969s">00:16:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there proud, proud that we're not like those lowly ones, or in comparison that we're somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=976s">00:16:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">better, and we believe we're better, or more significant, it completely exalts our vanity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=982s">00:16:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and it does not exalt Christ. It's unworthy of Christ. And so, ultimately, pride and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=989s">00:16:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">its selfishness, self-preserving, self-promotion, all of that, it's unworthy of the reality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=995s">00:16:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we believe. And so, the definition of humility actually is an accurate view of God and His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1001s">00:16:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reality. In humility, you're always vulnerable to truth. When reality and truth hits you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1009s">00:16:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your humility allows you to receive it and believe it. It's consistent with it. The grand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1014s">00:16:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">worldview of God shows us who we are. And so, a passage I want to highlight to you is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1021s">00:17:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Philippians. Philippians 2. Remember that in Philippians 2, 3, Scripture tells us that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1025s">00:17:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">without empty conceit, but rather with humility of mind, we are to regard others more important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1031s">00:17:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">than yourself. Okay? And again, a valid question to you then, I just tried to give some ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1038s">00:17:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and patterns of speech. I just tried to give some ways and patterns that we think. Are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1043s">00:17:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">your thoughts and is your speech consistent with what we profess to believe, even in chapters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1049s">00:17:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 2 of Ephesians? Okay? 1 through 3 of Ephesians. What's more, he says, "with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1054s">00:17:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">all gentleness." Okay, so all humility and gentleness, he says. Now, it's really closely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1059s">00:17:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tied with humility. Gentleness, the most common Greek word for that is "proutess." And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1067s">00:17:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">most commonly translated as gentleness. It's also translated sometimes as meekness or humility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1074s">00:17:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So there seems to be some kind of overlap there. Now, when we think about this though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1079s">00:17:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when we think about the term gentleness, it is used in not just simply, "Oh, I'm humble."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1085s">00:18:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But in a way where you're not reactive. Where essentially in your quick temper, your reactions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1091s">00:18:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are overly harsh. Okay? So in that way, are you gentle? I want to ask a question. Are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1096s">00:18:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you approachable? Now, when in terms of what we believe, we believe that God has been gentle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1104s">00:18:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with us. In the sense that, all we've learned about in Ephesians chapter 1 through 3, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1110s">00:18:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that God has kind intention, lavishing intentions to save, to cause us to be blameless and holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1119s">00:18:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? He has a very purposeful and intentional dealing with us. I mean, if you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1127s">00:18:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">scope of what Apostle Paul said in the salvation plan of God, can we sit there and be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1132s">00:18:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh my gosh, so harsh." Right? He overreacted. Like, is that what we're going to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1137s">00:18:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to say and judge God? No. The complete opposite. What's more, we read of Christ. I have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1142s">00:19:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">picture of a lion and a lamb. Because Christ is described this way when Christ said to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1147s">00:19:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">us, or the disciples, "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1152s">00:19:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. For I am gentle," which is the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1159s">00:19:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">word here, "and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." Wow. I think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1167s">00:19:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that and I think about the character of Christ. We are saying that I have seen the kindness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1175s">00:19:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of God. I have seen God's intentional purpose. I have seen the work of God. Like that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1181s">00:19:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul is highlighting. I've seen the intentional work of God. Right? But, for us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1189s">00:19:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then to have this kind of eruptive attitude where we respond to stuff where we can, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1197s">00:19:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know, again, the inconsistency for us to say, "My Savior has been gentle with me. I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1203s">00:20:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that I was a child of wrath. I know that I was supposed to be." God could have, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1208s">00:20:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">another way to put it is God should have punished me. Then and there. I believe that. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1216s">00:20:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">believe rather than doing that, God has been so kind and gentle. But what in the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1221s">00:20:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is wrong with you? It's so inconsistent if we work like that. And so I want to give just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1228s">00:20:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a quick encouragement. Kind of an encouragement that I recall back when I was in seminary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1233s">00:20:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my professors, Dr. John Street, would always say, and this he would always say to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1238s">00:20:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the men, the husbands. And he said, "Husbands, Scripture actually calls us to live in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1244s">00:20:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding way." Right? And I think all of that contributes to this idea of gentleness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1249s">00:20:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And he would always say, "They are like fine china, beautiful silverware that you're supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1254s">00:20:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to hold. Not so loosely and weakly that you drop it, but not so harshly that you break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1260s">00:21:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it with your own hands." And then he would rebuke and say, "Some of you guys, rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1264s">00:21:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">than treating your wives like fine china and beautiful silverware, you treat them like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1269s">00:21:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">tupperware." Right? The idea is, do you have that kind of control? Do you have that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1274s">00:21:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of intentionality? And I think that's important for us. The reason why I picked this picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1278s">00:21:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the lion and the lamb is because Christ has that unique element where one person might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1285s">00:21:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">think you're supposed to be this like doormat where you're always taking the backseat and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1290s">00:21:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">yielding. But the concept actually is not like that at all. The concept more so, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1296s">00:21:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the kind of word studies of the New Testament defined it like this. It says that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1303s">00:21:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you are able to maintain a posture. So the idea is you're in control, you're able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1307s">00:21:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maintain a posture before God and before circumstances where you can submit to whatever the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1313s">00:21:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">gives you. Okay? That's kind of an extensive definition. But what I'm trying to describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1320s">00:22:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's not the wrong idea of somebody who's just super weak. It is definitely not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1326s">00:22:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of some that we're supposed to avoid is the idea of somebody who is overly harsh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1331s">00:22:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I kind of think about a surgeon, right? If you're super harsh, then essentially you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1337s">00:22:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to cut too much. If you're super weak and you're not skilled in your surgery, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1343s">00:22:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to cut often. You're going to have to repeat the process. Question to you, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1347s">00:22:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you gentle? When you're not overly harsh and cutting way too deep and too much, but at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1353s">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the same time you're intentional and you're able to actually help. Right? Okay. Moving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1358s">00:22:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next thing, patience and tolerance and love. I put those things together because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1364s">00:22:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">after the study of the terms, they're really similar. Patience comes from the term macro</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1369s">00:22:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through mia. Okay. And taking literally, it means long suffering. Tolerance, it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1375s">00:22:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from the term anexo my, which means enduring, okay. Enduring difficulty. And so essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1383s">00:23:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea has this mentality where it's like, you're supposed to be able to absorb the wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1390s">00:23:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">done to you. And actually within both first Timothy and Titus, when it describes descriptions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1396s">00:23:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of leaders, it says, are you able to endure when wronged? Right. And I think that's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1403s">00:23:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting because Proverbs chapter 10 verse 12 describes an individual who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1408s">00:23:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">wise, who is able to have a heart that covers up all transgressions. Okay. If you're an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1415s">00:23:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">individual where you are so bothered by the offense, and again, confession, right? When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1422s">00:23:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">certain offenses just really, really boil within you and you can't overcome it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1427s">00:23:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes those offenses aren't even sins. It's just like annoyances. You just, people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1432s">00:23:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get on your nerve and tolerating and bearing with them. ESV translates this passage, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1438s">00:23:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of bearing, sorry, tolerance, it translates bearing with somebody, right? Some of us aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1444s">00:24:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even able to do that. And some of us are more inclined like, well, you know what, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1448s">00:24:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to offend me or you're going to attack me, the best defense is offense. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1452s">00:24:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so you go and you turn that around as an opportunity to hurt the other individual, right? But scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1459s">00:24:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually challenging us, no. Remember we were talking about consistency. The consistency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1466s">00:24:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of what we say we're believing, right? I mean, we are talking about how in Ephesians chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1473s">00:24:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">three, that Christ took away with the enmity. There was hostility. We were hostile against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1481s">00:24:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God. Well, we didn't want his kind of authority and rule in our lives. And what's more, his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1486s">00:24:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">law then, because of our hostility, because of our transgression, is hostile against us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1492s">00:24:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was this huge divide. Christ absorbed all that. And for us to be like, uh-uh, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1500s">00:25:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">will not stand for disrespect, right? And some of us are really sensitive. If something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1505s">00:25:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a word they say remotely sounds like you're patronizing me, like you're diminishing my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1510s">00:25:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">importance or you're not even thinking of me, we're like, uh-uh, I'm standing for this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1516s">00:25:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? The scripture actually calls us to a higher ethic, okay? Yes, is it true that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1523s">00:25:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say for parenting, you have to teach your children to abide by authority?

It's been crazy, right? And so, if ever we have this temptation in our hearts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1608s">00:26:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, "Well you know what?

Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1618s">00:26:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's inconsistent. What I mean is, sometimes we're tempted to essentially write off people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1623s">00:27:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and say, "Forget you then." Right? And at that moment, we are inconsistent with what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1628s">00:27:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're saying we believe. So, every single one of us, I'm sure, we want to grow in patience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1634s">00:27:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and long-suffering.

Verse 3 says this, okay? The third point is you need character</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1647s">00:27:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to build unity. And verse 3 says this, "Being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1654s">00:27:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the bond of peace." Okay? Now, real quickly here. The reason why I separated being diligent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1663s">00:27:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">from the others is because the others described these character traits, right? That are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1669s">00:27:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">humility and patience and things that we're all growing in. But being diligent is a participle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1675s">00:27:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? What I mean by participle is the whole idea of like the running, walking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1682s">00:28:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, it's an ongoing action. And so, just as a quick definition and also an encouragement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1693s">00:28:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being diligent means that you're showing your eagerness. You're showing your effort. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1697s">00:28:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">showing your earnestness. Right? And so, let's say hypothetically we have this conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1703s">00:28:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and we were telling this young man who is just like grew up staying at home and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1708s">00:28:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">feels more comfortable being left alone. And basically, you know, you encourage the guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1712s">00:28:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and you say, "Hey man, let's really fellowship and get together and try to connect." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1716s">00:28:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he's like, "Oh man, I mean I've tried before and it's just not working." You know? Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1722s">00:28:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you try and people don't reciprocate. Okay? What I'm gonna do is get all nerdy and be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1727s">00:28:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "But remember it was a present participle." Present meaning now. You tried, but are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1733s">00:28:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trying? Okay? What's more, it's a participle in the sense that it doesn't give you a parameter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1739s">00:28:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that the whole idea is you're being humble, patient, all that kind of stuff. All of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1744s">00:29:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">showing your earnestness to produce unity of the spirit or to preserve it. Right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1749s">00:29:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is I would ask then, "Hey, it's a good thing for you to just acknowledge, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1754s">00:29:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I should be trying and then to take go above that.

Why? Because this unity is worthy of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1767s">00:29:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">preserved.

And Christ specifically prayed for it and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=1790s">00:29:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it was accomplished and therefore it is worthy of our efforts to preserve it.

And so he says, "There is one body, one spirit, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2091s">00:34:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as also you were called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2096s">00:34:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all." Okay, as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2101s">00:35:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">look at this list I highlighted for you the term "one" because he repeats it seven times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2107s">00:35:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is the number of typically perfection. I don't want to make too much of it, but man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2111s">00:35:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what an emphatic little section here. This is the ground upon which we walk, as he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2118s">00:35:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">commanding us to walk, and the ground upon which we build the unity or preserve the unity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2123s">00:35:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that God has given us. The theme is oneness. MacArthur, John MacArthur comments on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2128s">00:35:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and says this, "This passage shows us that the foundation of our practical unity and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2134s">00:35:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">how we are to apply this is our spiritual oneness. Every application, every practical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2139s">00:35:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">unity that people long for, that people believe is powerful for us, comes out of the inner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2145s">00:35:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">oneness of God." Okay, and the way I like to put it is when you look at this passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2150s">00:35:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I ask, "Is there a theme going on here?" There kind of is. And the theme essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2154s">00:35:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is you have all that you need for unity to be truly one. Why? Because you are in all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2162s">00:36:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of God. Or another way to put it is you have all of God. You have what God has given us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2168s">00:36:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through his triune self. Christ prayed for that. He's there. The triune God is there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2176s">00:36:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There is one body and one spirit. There's one Lord, Jesus Christ, and one God, Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2182s">00:36:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of all. Right? And essentially that's what he's saying at the very end of it. Who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2187s">00:36:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">overall, the Father of all, who is overall through all and in all. And therefore then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2193s">00:36:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as we have this theme, I want to kind of wrap things up by thinking about how does this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2201s">00:36:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">build for us that foundation we're supposed to walk on to walking unity and oneness of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2207s">00:36:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">spirit together as a church. Because that's so important, right? Well, another passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2213s">00:36:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that summarizes this concept is 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 13 and 20. It says, "For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2222s">00:37:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2228s">00:37:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or free, and we were all made to drink of one spirit. There are many members, but one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2235s">00:37:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">body." Okay? So I want you to notice something there. He says, "Whether you're Jews or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2242s">00:37:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Greeks, slaves or free." Okay? Other parts of Scripture it says, "There's no male or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2246s">00:37:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">female here." Right? There's no, you know, Jew or Greek. There's no slave or free. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2253s">00:37:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mean think about the social categories. If there ever were dividing social categories,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2259s">00:37:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">those things would really separate people, right? I mean you have people who are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2263s">00:37:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">masters and lords and then people who are property. You have people on incredibly opposite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2268s">00:37:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sides of the spectrum on the social status. What they're even capable of, the circles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2272s">00:37:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're supposed to run around in and what they're even capable of doing. Some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2277s">00:37:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these individuals, remember, between Jews and Greeks in the sanctuary, there was an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2282s">00:38:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inner court and an outer court.

So I want you to think about that. Now, I want you to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2293s">00:38:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about cultural things that bring us together and then I want you to think this, okay? When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2300s">00:38:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the Scriptures talks about the spirit that we have one spirit, think about this that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2304s">00:38:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have through the spirit a new birth.

What's more, Scripture talks about that we are this body. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2323s">00:38:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just one body. This is our identity. Why?

I mean think about how much we have in common. And what then happens is when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2444s">00:40:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize that we have all this gracious you know elements that we have been afforded by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2450s">00:40:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">God held in common by the church.

And the reporter asked, "You're a citizen like everybody else."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2622s">00:43:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the girl responded, "Look I'm first a black female Muslim American but in that order."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2629s">00:43:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reporter said, "Oh I see but we have a problem." Now the reason why I point this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2637s">00:43:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out is because you and I exercise a priority in our identity in our mind. We have a worldview</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2645s">00:44:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by which certain things take precedence. We have a worldview where certain things matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2650s">00:44:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't sometimes intentionally put it there but that's how we've operated. And for a young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2655s">00:44:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">girl she has certain identity portions that are completely first tier priority for her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2661s">00:44:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and therefore when asked the question, "What about your general citizenship?" She says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2665s">00:44:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"That's last on the podium for us." We have to think about this and say, "You, whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2675s">00:44:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's culturally, identity, all that stuff. You are first of Christ. You have one God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2684s">00:44:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and Father and everything else you just happen to be. Your first and foremost priority identity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2691s">00:44:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is of Christ and everything is a far far second." And so Apostle Paul is pointing to this. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2700s">00:45:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you understood chapters 1 through 3, we have incredible foundation for unity. We have everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2709s">00:45:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as we abide in Christ to belong to the family of God as God is building up that household.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2716s">00:45:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">To keep the unity of faith is a worthy cause and that is the proper worldview. You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2722s">00:45:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I was so challenged that a lot of commentators mentioned, "Think about every treaty that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2727s">00:45:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">has been made in history between nations and countries. How many of those percentage wise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2732s">00:45:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do you think have been kept where neither parties you know made any kind of infractions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2737s">00:45:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and transgress the stipulations of those treaties?" Very few. No treaty, no mutually beneficial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2745s">00:45:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">agreement or contract is going to do and provide for us the kind of powerful unity and oneness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2752s">00:45:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we know is so precious, is so pleasing to God and also beneficial for us. It's sweet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2759s">00:45:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for us. It's lovely. It's amazing. Nothing on earth is going to produce that. Only the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2769s">00:46:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">power of Christ. Only the power of the Spirit. And so with that I want to conclude by saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2774s">00:46:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">man Pastor Peter's sermon this past Sunday when he was talking about Christ as the light</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2780s">00:46:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and essentially is the way. He's lighting the direction and the way for us. We are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2787s">00:46:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on the exact same path so actually beyond even this passage we could talk about so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2793s">00:46:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">more. Let's make sure that we're focused on the right kind, the right source, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2798s">00:46:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right result of the unity that God has for us because ultimately all of that is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2804s">00:46:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be pleasing to him. Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father we thank you so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2811s">00:46:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for your grace. God, we're to think that our Savior is praying for us and that long ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2820s">00:47:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">before we even existed of course he knew. And God his kind intention has been then meticulously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2828s">00:47:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">over such a long time. We can't even trace it ourselves because our minds are so limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2835s">00:47:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All that Lord God we just thank you and we're amazed.

For those of us Father God I just feel sometimes weak to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2848s">00:47:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">out and take initiative and all that stuff. We recognize that's not done because it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2854s">00:47:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">happens to be to be good.

Because you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/410445402#t=2859s">00:47:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pleased by it.
