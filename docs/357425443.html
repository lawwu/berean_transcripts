href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=131s">00:02:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And in each case, there's usually a little bit of a fumbling around and</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=144s">00:02:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it almost seems like you have to give a holy answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=148s">00:02:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually when a question like this is posed, the couple answers something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=154s">00:02:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, to glorify God by raising a godly family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=158s">00:02:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It always goes up, cuz you're not a 100% sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=162s">00:02:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not an incorrect answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=165s">00:02:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is actually a question that's very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=175s">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And because it is not often asked, it is seldom reflected on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=190s">00:03:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably not too often,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=192s">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're just trying to survive day to day just doing life together.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=206s">00:03:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or in other words, to what purpose or for what purpose have I been saved?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=213s">00:03:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, because we seldom ask this of ourselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/357425443#t=224s">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So in scripture, the answer to this question is very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
