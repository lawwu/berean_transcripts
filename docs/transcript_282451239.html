Last year, Captain Corc next sport won against Nemesis of Genesis and spread the gospel across the galaxy. Nemesis even accepted Christ and picked up his cross. This year, the 2018 Marines Summer Olympics are about to begin! So countries such as Wakanda, Kuala, Pani, Scrantonia, and Maria may begin to compete at the highest level.</p><p>Well, church! It's a fine day for the 2018 Marine Olympics! I'm your host, Miss Announcer! Behind me, we have the top athletes from around the galaxy, each representing their home planet. No surprise to find that no matter what size, shape, or color of our skin, our same love for sports unites us.</p><p>Join us today as we watch the athletes compete in the three-legged race at the jump rope. Now, in lane one, we have... the... Cavendish Savage and the Kualan! In lane two, the... Wakandan! And in lane three, the Bereans! In lane four, Scrantonia! And in lane five, Pani. Now, as the racers and the Olympians get ready for their events, let's all cheer for the teams that you would like to win.</p><p>Now, racers, on your mark, get set, go! And they're off! And the Kualans are definitely beating everybody in the athlete world! What an astonishing victory from the Kualans! Wow, there's so many strong, skilled, and smart athletes here. How will I even survive? Whoa! Hey, watch where you're going! Yeah, watch it.</p><p>Sorry, I didn't mean to. Hey, hey, hey, you didn't mean to. Watch where you're going, okay? Do you even belong here? Yeah, what are you doing here anyway? Look at yourself. Do you look like an Olympian? Have you looked at yourself lately? Dude, stop copying me. Dude, stop copying me.</p><p>Hey, knock it off. It's a competition. What do you want? Is this yours? You're right. They're so strong like the Egyptians. You can never beat them. They do look pretty strong, huh? You know what? I'm confident that our God is stronger than the Egyptians and their armies and those people who made fun of us.</p><p>You know why? Because God always wins. Come on, let's pray. Dear God, even though this strong may hurt us, you are the greatest and the most almighty. Please deliver us. In your name we pray. Amen. You're right. God always wins. Let's chant. God always wins. What are you guys doing?</p><p>God always wins. God always wins. Yeah, what's up with that? Ew, wait. What's on your arms and your faces? Oh, you have boils everywhere. You have so many boils. You're ugly. No, you guys are ugly. I'm ugly. I can't go out looking like this. Not with the next competition.</p><p>And the boils on my feet hurt so bad. What? Hey, don't be a little princess. Yeah, man up. You're right. I'm like a little puberty, stomach for win, gold medal. Okay. Now, as the athletes prepare for the next event, the jump rope competition, we're going to have the competitors from the Bereans and the Wakandans and the Koalans.</p><p>And as they set up, who do you think will win? All right. So first, the Scrantonians and the Pawnee are going to go against each other. Ooh, ooh, close competition. Who's going to--oh, that--wow, what a sad loss for Pawnee. Next in the competition, the Bereans versus the Koalans. All right, looks close.</p><p>Who's going to give up first? Will it be the Bereans? Oh, there's locusts everywhere. Oh, no, the locusts are too great for the Koalans, and they lost. Wow, God does always win. And no one can ever resist him. Thanks for helping me. What's your name again? I'm Anna Banana.</p><p>I'm Keeley, Keeley Seeley. Come on. I'm going to jump the giant and try to defend the jump. Ooh, yeah, let's do it. And there you have it. Anna Banana and Keeley Seeley have gained one point, and they will be advancing to the next round of games. Who will be awarded for the gold medal this year?</p><p>Will Anna Banana be able to win tomorrow's competition and beat Cabbage the Savage? Find out tomorrow in the first ever before ultra super amazing event at the first Oregon Olympic Games. (audience cheering)</p></div></body></html>
