href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1919s">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in Daegu, there was an orphanage called Love and Hope Orphanage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1923s">00:32:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this orphanage was started by a Christian after the Korean War.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1928s">00:32:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But eventually, this orphanage only took in kids who were, what do you call it, physically handicapped, severe handicap, severe down syndrome or autism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1941s">00:32:21.000</a></span> | <span

so what happened was at the same time, we had a friend of mine who was in the military, and his wife were there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1955s">00:32:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they had already adopted a couple of kids before coming to Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1959s">00:32:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They adopted a kid from Korea, where they were in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1963s">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had a Korean boy, and they adopted a girl from Kenya.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1967s">00:32:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So she was, you know, African, I guess, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1971s">00:32:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for whatever reason, they wanted to adopt another child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1976s">00:32:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, they came out to the orphanage, and they decided to adopt a six-month-old baby girl for one reason, one reason only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1988s">00:33:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because she was born without a poop sack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1992s">00:33:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some kids are born that way, but there's medical procedure to fix that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=1999s">00:33:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the orphanage didn't have enough funds to do that procedure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2003s">00:33:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you adopt a child, if you're a soldier, military, instantly you get into the old medical coverage in the military, in the best of hospitals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2012s">00:33:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why they adopted this child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2014s">00:33:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was a chaplain, and a pastor, and they asked me to come for that official ceremony where they sign the paperwork for the official adoption and everything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2024s">00:33:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they asked me to come and say a blessing for that adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2028s">00:33:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was there, and I prayed for that, and it was like I was so convicted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2036s">00:33:56.000</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">His wife's name is Leah Young, and Steve was his name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2046s">00:34:06.000</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2078s">00:34:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in my heart, in my mind, it's like God is speaking to me, "So what is your excuse?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2085s">00:34:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, I didn't know this, but my wife was praying for me that God would change my heart to adopt a child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2092s">00:34:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So long story short, we adopted -- his name is Paul Nam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2096s">00:34:56.000</a></span> | <span

reason why we named him Christian is because we told our older kids to come up with a name to raise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/230292530#t=2105s">00:35:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, one of the kids' name I think was David, and one was John,</span></div><div class="c"><span
