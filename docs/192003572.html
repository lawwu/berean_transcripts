diminished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/192003572#t=676s">00:11:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That people were going to just, you know, swing so far

during the Reformation, during the Protestant Reformation, John Calvin actually repeats this in his book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
