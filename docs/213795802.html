my family took a short trip to Korea and then we stopped by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=118s">00:01:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Japan

things about the Korean culture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=136s">00:02:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that I really didn't

those who are in their 50s and 60s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=144s">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm talking about my parents' generation, like 80s and 90s and up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=147s">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I noticed that that generation, especially when I started working in the Korean church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=152s">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're not really good at planning ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=155s">00:02:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't believe in insurance, life insurance or anything that, you know, retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=160s">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't really think in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=161s">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They're really good at just surviving, you know, whatever it takes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=166s">00:02:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're hard workers and I respect them for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=169s">00:02:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But for whatever the reason, they would never plan for the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=174s">00:02:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that I realized was that there's a lot of people who are in their 80s, 70s</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=178s">00:02:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or 80s that don't know their age or maybe older than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=182s">00:03:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you ask them how old they are and say, "Oh, I think I'm 82 or 83 or say 90 or whatever."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=188s">00:03:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And they wouldn't know their age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=189s">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And for years I was like, "Why would they not know their age?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=193s">00:03:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized later on that a lot of that was because they went through, that generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=199s">00:03:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">went through a severe war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=202s">00:03:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those of you guys who know the history of the Korean War, basically the war started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=206s">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">between the North and the South and North came down and pushed the Korean population</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=211s">00:03:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way to the tip in Pusan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=214s">00:03:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then MacArthur and his army came and pushed him all the way back to the border of China</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=217s">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and North Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=219s">00:03:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the Chinese army came in and they pushed them all the way back and go back and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=222s">00:03:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=223s">00:03:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So during that process, there wasn't an inch of the Korean peninsula that wasn't affected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=228s">00:03:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by this war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=229s">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so during that period, some people were forced to, or not some people, most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=234s">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">had to flee from their homes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=237s">00:03:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They grabbed their bags and whatever that they had, whether they were rich or poor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">educated or uneducated, every single person had to live on the road going back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=246s">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so part of the reason why a lot of people didn't know their age was because they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=250s">00:04:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">pulled out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=251s">00:04:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And in Korea, they don't register their children at the hospital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=253s">00:04:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They have to register at another center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=255s">00:04:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you happen to be born right during that period and your parents didn't register you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=260s">00:04:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">later on when they went back to school, they just kind of put them back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=264s">00:04:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So some people went back after two years, some people went back after four years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=267s">00:04:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have fellow classmates who are two years younger or four years older.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=271s">00:04:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just kind of, imagine a country that was just kind of shaken up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=276s">00:04:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then some people were living in the South, had to flee, or North had to flee to the South</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=280s">00:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and South up North.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=282s">00:04:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one day in the middle of this fight, they didn't want to cause another world war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=288s">00:04:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So they just came out of World War II.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=290s">00:04:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So they said, you know, we're not to prevent World War III.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=293s">00:04:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They decided we're going to stop this war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=296s">00:04:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wasn't a peace settlement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=297s">00:04:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They just decided we're going to stop this war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=299s">00:04:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they drew a line at the 38th parallel, which I call now like a DMZ area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=306s">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you happen to get stuck in the North, you couldn't see whoever it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=310s">00:05:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It could have been your children, your grandparents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=313s">00:05:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you happen to go up there for business and you got stuck up there, you got stuck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=316s">00:05:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">up there for good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=318s">00:05:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a lot of, if you talk to people who are from Korea, you ask them, are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=323s">00:05:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">South Korean, North Korean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=324s">00:05:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, they're going to say South

because that's where they were born.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=330s">00:05:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where their family

in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/213795802#t=337s">00:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">early, you know, like 10 or pure teens or teens, and, or
