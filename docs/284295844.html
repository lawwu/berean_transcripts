this one year is too short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=89s">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't do anything really in this one

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=104s">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it made me think, and I asked him, "Do you feel called to America?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=112s">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I got my answer for myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=118s">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I should really make a confirmation of the call to ever make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=122s">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The command is to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=123s">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we stayed there for a year, extended it to three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=127s">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We said, "Well, we need two more years."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=129s">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the next two years, I was really burdened with this thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=135s">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time we set a date to leave, we're not going to give our hearts into this ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so we just got to go home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=142s">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have no passion for China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=143s">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a vested interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=145s">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we just made a commitment, "Okay, we will be here for the rest of our lives until God moves us elsewhere."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that three years turned into a long-term vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=154s">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But God put on my heart a desire to champion the cause of children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=159s">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've been a Compassion International sponsor since 1997.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=163s">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I went on a trip to the Philippines with my wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back then, it was a five-year anniversary kind of a trip, and I was blown away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=170s">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Compassion Korea recruited me, so I ended up in Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=175s">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what my job was, was a vision trip leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=179s">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my job was to take anybody and everybody--VIPs, national leaders, church leaders, celebrities, random people, student groups--anybody and everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=190s">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If they want to go somewhere, I'm the one who takes them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that was my job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=194s">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so wherever I went, it wasn't that--you know, we weren't staying at, like, the nice resorts and--well, our hotels were nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we weren't, like, going to hang out at the beach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=203s">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What we were going to do was to visit the slums, visit the trenches, visit the garbage dumpsites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of the stories I've gained over the last six years are all pictures that I've taken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=214s">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just want to just share with some--review some of the stories that I've gained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=220s">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in my time at Compassion, I totaled it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was on 279 flights in the five years, four months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=229s">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was about 55 flights a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I had--all the boarding has to have, like, this many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've seen a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=238s">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I would love to do on an airplane, I usually get the window seat, and I like to watch as the plane goes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But after a while, that gets old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=246s">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But wherever I went to for the first time, I like to watch for the last hour of the descent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you kind of see a bigger picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=254s">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I usually would--I didn't like to watch movies too much because I felt like it would be a waste of my time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=261s">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I turned on the Sky Map, and I studied that map.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was one of my favorite things to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=266s">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've discovered that this world is not small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=272s">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=273s">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So during the course of my job, I visited many, many poor families.</span></div><div

me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284295844#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've woken up to monkeys fighting outside my
