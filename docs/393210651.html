Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4132s">01:08:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">apostolic fathers is a very fancy way of saying the people who were in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4138s">01:08:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle small group. Okay? So whoever was in, like, that's, okay, they're disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4143s">01:09:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So Apostle Peter's disciple. Apostle John's disciple. Paul's disciple. Matthew's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4154s">01:09:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Nathanael's disciple. Like, they're disciples. Okay? Collectively as a group,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4160s">01:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right, were the apostolic fathers. When I say early church fathers, it's like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4165s">01:09:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">time period. There's like generations. Okay? And you can kind of cut it off at some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4170s">01:09:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">point, but like, that's what I'm talking about. The early church fathers. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4174s">01:09:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">apostolic fathers go within the group of the early church fathers. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4178s">01:09:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">apostolic fathers are the ones who learned directly from the Apostles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4182s">01:09:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Directly. Okay? So Clement says, "Take up the epistles of the blessed Apostle Paul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4188s">01:09:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">To be sure, he sent you a letter in the spirit concerning himself and Cephas and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4192s">01:09:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Apollos. The Apostles received the gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4197s">01:09:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ was sent from God. The Christ, therefore, is from God and the Apostles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4200s">01:10:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from Christ." So very early on, they were taught that the Apostles were speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4208s">01:10:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the Word of God. And they were taught that because the Apostles taught them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4214s">01:10:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. The Apostles taught them that because Jesus said it would happen. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4221s">01:10:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the power doesn't come from the Apostles. The power comes from God. So let me go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4228s">01:10:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">back here. Okay? So I don't want anyone to miss this point. We talk about divine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4232s">01:10:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">qualities. We talk about apostolic origins. And we talk about corporate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4236s">01:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reception. Those three points are important because God has said so. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4244s">01:10:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus comes on the scene. He confirms the Old Testament. Right? If the Old Testament</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4251s">01:10:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time wasn't the Old Testament, he would have said, "Take Job out. Take Psalms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4255s">01:10:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">out. Take Deuteronomy out." He doesn't do that. Okay? And remember, this is the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4261s">01:11:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">man who made Lazarus rise from the dead. Do you want to know if Jesus is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4266s">01:11:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actual historical figure as opposed to a myth? Everyone that saw Jesus, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4274s">01:11:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't deny who he was. Historians who hated Christians wrote that Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4281s">01:11:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">existed. Do you know why? Because they couldn't deny who he was. Let me give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4286s">01:11:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">an example. If you're a hardcore Republican and you hate Barack Obama, can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4291s">01:11:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you deny that he was the president? No. No. You can't deny that he was a president.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4296s">01:11:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a hardcore Democrat and you hate Donald Trump, can you deny that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4300s">01:11:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the president? No. You can't deny it. You can say, "I don't like him," but you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4304s">01:11:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">deny it. It's the same thing with Jesus. There were historians commissioned by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4308s">01:11:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Rome who hated Jesus, who hated Christians, but they couldn't deny that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4315s">01:11:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he existed. They couldn't deny it. Do you know why? Because he did everything in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4319s">01:11:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">public, which is in direct contradiction to every single religious figure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4326s">01:12:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">has existed through time. No one, not all religions are equal, not all ideas are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4332s">01:12:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">equal. That is malarkey. All men are created equal because we're all men and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4337s">01:12:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">women, because we're made in the image of God, but not all ideas are equal, not all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4341s">01:12:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">religions are equal. The reason Christianity stands in stark contrast to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4345s">01:12:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">every other single religion is because of Jesus Christ, okay? So what happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4351s">01:12:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, what happened was people would see the risen Christ. He's obviously God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4356s">01:12:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because he's raising people from the dead.

After the fact, they want to squash Christians, so they say, "Deny the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4366s">01:12:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that Jesus is the Christ or you die," and you know what a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4369s">01:12:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">chose? They chose death. These are historical facts. So a lot of people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4376s">01:12:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saw the resurrected Christ said, "I'm not gonna deny him," and they just died. Some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4379s">01:12:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of these people were thrown into the Colosseum. Some of them were lit on fire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4383s">01:13:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">okay? Let me further this for you. I say the same thing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4389s">01:13:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">BCC Lesson 4, but let me give you this other example, okay? If you and I saw the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4394s">01:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">risen Christ, right, if you and I saw the risen Christ and we don't believe in him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4397s">01:13:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no actual faith, okay? If you put a gun to my head and you say, "Deny Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4402s">01:13:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or I'm gonna shoot you," I don't care if it's true. I don't care. I'm just gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4408s">01:13:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">say, I'm just gonna say, "I deny him." You know why? Even though it's true, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4415s">01:13:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">want to die. I don't want to die. So I'm gonna be like, "Yeah, I saw him do all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4422s">01:13:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that, but I don't really care. So yeah, Jesus, yeah, he's, I don't, like, whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4425s">01:13:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they're saying, I disavow everything that they're saying." You and I are gonna do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4431s">01:13:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But for some reason, this figure, this man, is different. For some reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4439s">01:13:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">people saw him, right? People saw him. He claimed he was God. He claimed he was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4445s">01:14:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Messiah. He claimed that he will give you life. He claimed that you should follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4450s">01:14:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">him. And after that, he rose from the dead and people said, "What do you want me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4458s">01:14:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do?" The man rose from the dead. "So I'm gonna trust him, even though you kill me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4465s">01:14:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Just kill me." "Well, I'm gonna throw you and your kid into the Coliseum. I'm gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4471s">01:14:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">light you on fire, and I'm gonna light your kid on fire." "Well, this is kind of hard."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4476s">01:14:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I saw him rise from the dead. I saw him rise from the dead. And he told me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4483s">01:14:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you would kill me. He told me that you were gonna do this to me. I don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4489s">01:14:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">die. I don't want to see my kid burned. But I can't deny him. And so a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4494s">01:14:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people face that. So when I tell you Christ confirms the Old Testament canon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4499s">01:14:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the power behind it. Okay? He's not just some other guy, "Oh, this is church, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4506s">01:15:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when he says Jesus, every correct answer is Jesus." That's not what I'm saying. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4510s">01:15:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot that goes into Christ confirming the Old Testament canon. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4515s">01:15:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If you just reduce it to, "Oh, this is church, so he can say Jesus," right? That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4521s">01:15:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is extremely anti-intellectual. That is extremely anti-intellectual. It is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4526s">01:15:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">unfaithful to reason, and frankly, you just probably don't want to believe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4531s">01:15:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">God, and that's why you think that. But it is not because you're intellectual. It is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4537s">01:15:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">not because you're intellectual. In fact, it is the exact opposite. Okay? That was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4541s">01:15:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">little pause right there, because I felt like I had to do it. Alright? So let me go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4545s">01:15:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on here. Point number two. The Didache was an early Christian manual of church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4549s">01:15:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">practice. Okay? So the Didache, right, is like a manual. It's like an instruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4555s">01:15:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">guide, right?

It had all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4560s">01:16:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scripture in it. Tons of scripture. From very early on, let me go back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4565s">01:16:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">something Jude said in verse 3.

No. It is once for all delivered to the saints. Right? The fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4582s">01:16:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that the Didache, going back to about a hundred AD, encapsulates this.

On a parchment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4719s">01:18:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can carry so many books, right?

With a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4739s">01:18:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">binding, you can actually do that. For some strange reason, Christianity comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4744s">01:19:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on the scene and immediately favors codices.

So now Christianity is being challenged, right? So because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4791s">01:19:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this man's heresy, they got to prove that this man's heresy is not truth, right?

By 200 AD, as a result of, probably as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4804s">01:20:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">result of that, the New Testament was already established and we know that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4808s">01:20:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the Muratorian Fragment.

So because of this guy's heresy, someone's like, "Prove to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=4832s">01:20:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">me that this isn't the Bible.

Without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5611s">01:33:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">getting into the weeds too much, they're generally identical, but the one that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5618s">01:33:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">King James and New King James uses, right, they have a couple more verses. One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5624s">01:33:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">example is in 1st John chapter 5, when it talks about the Trinity, and King James</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5629s">01:33:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and New King James, I think it's chapter 5, it directly says there are three that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5633s">01:33:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">testify, the Father, God, and the Holy Spirit, right? Now that's, that's like a direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5638s">01:33:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">statement of the Trinity, right?

So the two major codices have like a couple verses that are different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5650s">01:34:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So then the one we use, for various reasons, that, the one we use seem to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5656s">01:34:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more accurate. And then if I, to do the analysis of that, we'll take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5661s">01:34:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of time, but to answer your question, yes. Yes. That, that codicy is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5668s">01:34:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">based upon the compilation of the manuscripts that we have, also the copies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5674s">01:34:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of the manuscripts that we have. That makes sense. So there, there aren't any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5680s">01:34:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like original letter, they're all, they're all destroyed. Like, we don't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5685s">01:34:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">original Colossians. Like, we don't, we don't have that, right? But the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5691s">01:34:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have like an original copy doesn't mean that we don't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5695s">01:34:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">original content. And the reason that's not true is because we know that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5700s">01:35:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">letter was disseminated and we know that it was copied, and when, remember, when they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5704s">01:35:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">copied it, they knew it was the Word of God. So there were all these copies, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5708s">01:35:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So theoretically, just keep this in mind, if you have the Word of God and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5715s">01:35:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">understood it to be the Word of God, and there's a hundred copies of this, but we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5719s">01:35:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have the original. But everyone's saying there's a hundred copies and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5723s">01:35:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all identical, right? Do you think the hundred copies that are like word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5727s">01:35:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for word, letter for letter, identical? Is that a copy of the original? Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5733s">01:35:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It definitely, it's not gonna be like a hundred different copies and they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5737s">01:35:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong, but the original is now gone, so we're just, we're just toast, right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5743s">01:35:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not the case at all. So we don't have any originals, but we have copies, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5749s">01:35:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then copies upon copies, right? And then there's like, like the earliest ones, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5754s">01:35:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have them like, they give them like P, P designations, like P52 and the fragments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5758s">01:35:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of John, and that's kind of getting into the weeds. Just, just generally speaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5762s">01:36:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's, that's how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5765s">01:36:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The New England translation claims to use the same codices as in major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5771s">01:36:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">translations, but then they add in their own words.

Like, so like, the teaching of purgatory comes from Tobit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5910s">01:38:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a book of the Apocrypha, right?

I'm pretty sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5915s">01:38:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but it comes from the Apocrypha, right? And so when you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5921s">01:38:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Apocrypha and you see what they teach, it doesn't come from any other book. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5926s">01:38:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't, you don't see a purgatory in any other book except the Apocrypha. Yeah. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5931s">01:38:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so that, that's, that's one example. But that's a, that's a huge example, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5936s">01:38:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know, like, because the Scripture is talking about it's once and for all. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5941s">01:39:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">die, there is no second chance.

There's nothing like that, right? But the Apocrypha speaks to a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5950s">01:39:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">destination than the rest of the books, right? So with the Apocrypha, you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5956s">01:39:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">argument from doctrinal disunity, but you also have the argument from the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=5959s">01:39:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's not from apostolic origins, right?

The idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6868s">01:54:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">direct revelation is not new. It's not a new idea.

So when you get to the New Testament, it's not like, "Well, let's try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6884s">01:54:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this new idea of direct revelation." So that's not the case, right? It's already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6888s">01:54:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">been done, right? Direct revelation has already been done, right? So Paul says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6893s">01:54:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">"We're ministers of the new covenant."

Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6909s">01:55:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "We're ministers of the new covenant."

So this idea of direct revelation, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6922s">01:55:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">say, kind of like the underpinning of it, the underpinning is that it is not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/393210651#t=6927s">01:55:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">novel idea, right?
