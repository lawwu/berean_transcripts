this necessity of judgment, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/288796352#t=320s">00:05:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That is absolutely

href="https://www.vimeo.com/288796352#t=351s">00:05:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because he says that if the community does not, you know, have concern for this</span></div><div
