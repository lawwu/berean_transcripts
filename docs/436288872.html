there should be an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=219s">00:03:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">empowerment that now you're able to be subject

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=287s">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">scripture saying, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord for

the first, it says, "You need to obey your parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=796s">00:13:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because this is

original intent of God and how He has structured things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=835s">00:13:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that is

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=853s">00:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of radical independence, that kind of arrogant thinking is contrary to

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=863s">00:14:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot for you guys to think through there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=865s">00:14:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't answer necessarily everything, but at least we started looking through the command.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=870s">00:14:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we started looking through the parameters or at least in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=874s">00:14:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we looked at the rationale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=876s">00:14:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're going to see is that that pattern repeats itself multiple times throughout this section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=880s">00:14:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, going to the fathers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=883s">00:14:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=883s">00:14:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Going to the fathers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=886s">00:14:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It says here, to the fathers, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=894s">00:14:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=899s">00:14:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, it particularly speaks to fathers, but obviously, it's not saying like, "You know, moms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=905s">00:15:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just do whatever you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=911s">00:15:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things I just want to mention is I really like the author, Paul Tripp,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=917s">00:15:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to parenting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=919s">00:15:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And he has a lot of great books, like multiple books when it comes to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=923s">00:15:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here, in our observation of this text, what's really interesting to me is he kind of highlights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=929s">00:15:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul highlights, you know, the scriptures highlight here one perhaps tendency that has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=934s">00:15:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">happened a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=935s">00:15:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=936s">00:15:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a negative command that says, "Do not provoke your children to anger."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=941s">00:15:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=942s">00:15:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we look at that, we realize, "Hey, there is a pattern where parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=947s">00:15:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps in their use of the authority that God has vested into them above their children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=953s">00:15:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this can also go sour to the irritation, frustration,

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=959s">00:15:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'd have to start kind of thinking, "What are some of the things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=964s">00:16:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what are some of our habits that anger children?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=969s">00:16:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What are ways that parents really set people off?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=972s">00:16:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could even just kind of imagine your own upbringing, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=975s">00:16:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, not to like dig up old wounds, but you can just start thinking about your own past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=979s">00:16:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Huh, what were things that caused anger?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=982s">00:16:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why, even if you're single, even if you don't have kids yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=985s">00:16:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all that kind of stuff, you should be thinking about this is because you realize that when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=990s">00:16:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are placed in a scenario where you now have vested authority and you have a lot of authority,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=997s">00:16:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, think about how much authority is vested and entrusted to the parent by God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1003s">00:16:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1005s">00:16:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole realm of care, instruction, raising up and discipling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1011s">00:16:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's in the authority and responsibility of the parent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1015s">00:16:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as you think about that, we as sinners, when we are given that amount of authority,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1020s">00:17:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a tendency to go astray with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1024s">00:17:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I think about it, some of the top things that come to mind typically is that the mom is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/436288872#t=1031s">00:17:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely over-controlling and that the dad is
