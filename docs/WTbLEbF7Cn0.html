href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbLEbF7Cn0&t=642">00:10:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second class are fourfold disciplines of the Christian life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbLEbF7Cn0&t=646">00:10:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is for daily devotions, prayer, evangelism, fellowship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbLEbF7Cn0&t=651">00:10:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's going to be more of a practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbLEbF7Cn0&t=653">00:10:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's going to be brief teaching, and then
