At this time, we're going to go ahead and get started. So if you are over by the cafe or walking about, please go ahead and take your seat at this time. And per usual, we're going to take a moment to pray together and open up with a time of worship. So let's bow our heads and pray. Lord God, one of the things that we want to ask for, Lord, is deep conviction. Father, we recognize that some of the things that we learn are our repeat reminders. And then some of the things we learn, God, are heavy. It's surprising some of the language we see in the scriptures. But I hope that even then, it doesn't stop with, oh, we observe something fresh, but rather that we find conviction from your word into our hearts. I pray, Father God, that the things that we do learn as faithful children and also as your servants, that we are intentionally looking for opportunities to apply. We're looking for where in our lives we have to be extra careful and where, Lord, in our own personal walks we have to be corrected. I pray, Father God, that you grant to us this kind of conviction, Lord. We want to thank you for the opportunity again tonight that we have to join together with our brothers and sisters. And now, Lord, as we lift up our voices, we want to lift to you our praise. May you be honored. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. We'll go into a time of praise.   As we seek your face. As we seek your face, may we know your heart. Feel your presence, acceptance as we seek your face. At your feet. At your feet we fall. Suffering, Lord. We cry holy, holy. At your feet we fall. Jesus, draw me close. Jesus, draw me close. Closer, Lord, to you. Let the worlds around me fade away. Jesus, draw me close. Jesus, draw me close. Closer, Lord, to you. For I desire to worship and obey. Jesus, draw me close. Jesus, draw me close. Closer, Lord, to you. Let the worlds around me fade away. Jesus, draw me close. Closer, Lord, to you. For I desire to worship and-- For I desire to worship and-- For I desire to worship and obey. Speak, O Lord. Speak, O Lord, as we come to you to receive the food of your holy word. Take your truth, plant it deep in us. Shape and fashion us in your likeness that the light of Christ might be seen today in our acts of love and our deeds of faith. Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory. Teach us, Lord, full obedience, holy reverence, true humility. Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your purity. Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see your majestic love and authority. Words of power that can never fail, let their truth prevail over unbelief. Speak, O Lord. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds. Help us grasp the heights of your plans for us. Truths unchanged from the dawn of time that will anchor down through eternity. And by grace, we'll stand on your promises. And by faith, we'll walk as you walk with us. Speak, O Lord, till your church is built and the earth is filled with your glory. And by your grace. And by grace, we'll stand on your promises. And by faith, we'll walk as you walk with us. Speak, O Lord, till your church is built and the earth is filled with your glory. Speak, O Lord, till your church is built and the earth is filled with your glory.  All right. Just a few announcements before we go into our discussion groups. So just as a reminder, next week, we're having our praise and prayer on Friday, which starts at 7:30. And so no midweek Bible study for the next week. Also, one of the things I just want to ask you to do is this past Sunday, we had a survey posted by our media team asking questions about where you find your information, if you've had any difficulty. So if you look on the church app right on this week, you'll see it there at the bottom, Media Team Survey. Please take a moment to do that. It only takes two minutes, and that'll help our team a lot just get information and some metrics, OK? And then finally, for those of you guys who are on the overflow, because of the events and things happening, we're going to be packing everything down after the Bible study is done. So we'll be taking away the tables and chairs and putting the brown chairs in on the other side, OK? All right, thanks, everybody. Please go ahead and enter into a time of discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           All right, if we can begin to wrap up and give you about three minutes to get back into place.</p></div></body></html>
