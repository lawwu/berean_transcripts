He says no man can see God and live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the whole drama that we see in the book of Leviticus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=225s">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is to create a way to cover for mankind's sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in the presence of God as they are, without the covering of blood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they shall surely die.

book of Leviticus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in how this holy God can be in the presence of the nation of Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we get to the book of Numbers where he invites people to the tabernacle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=248s">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and now they're able to interact with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=251s">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the kind of theme of these three books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=253s">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so where we are in the book of Leviticus is God has been teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=257s">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">every single part of this is the nature of his holiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and man's sinfulness and how that can be reconciled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=267s">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Leviticus basically is the gospel message, every part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=271s">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not just a simplistic gospel message where God is holy, man is sinful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=275s">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody died, and then so therefore we're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that in and of itself obviously is the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=280s">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's detailed aspects where God wanted Israel to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=286s">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what does it mean for God to be holy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it mean for man to be sinful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=290s">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he describes sin in detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=293s">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Inadvertent sin, a rebellious sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's sin where you touch something and you defile something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's burnt offering, there's peace offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=301s">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of these things are descriptions of various kinds of sins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=305s">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and how that needs to be dealt with to be in the presence of a holy God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=310s">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the context of that, chapter 10 basically is a warning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=317s">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you do not follow what I tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=321s">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is what's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you imagine what happens to the nation of Israel after this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=327s">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can imagine maybe some level of excitement before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were setting this whole up, it's like our God who delivered us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=335s">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from the nation of Israel, a powerful God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who caused us to cross the Red Sea, and he's going to be in our midst.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/263662481#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can kind of imagine the excitement that may have been in the nation of
