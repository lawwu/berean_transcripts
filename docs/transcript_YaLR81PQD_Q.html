What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer. Oh, what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer. Have we trials? Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness. Take it to the Lord in prayer.  Are we weak and heavy laden, comforted with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer. In his arms he'll take and shield you. You will find a solace there. Blessed Savior, blessed Savior, thou hast promised. Thou wilt all our burdens bear. May we ever, Lord, be bringing all to thee in earth. May we ever be in earnest prayer. Soon in glory bright and clouded, there will be no need for prayer. Rapture, praise, and endless worship will be our sweet portion there. Rapture. Rapture, praise, and endless worship will be our sweet portion there.   O great God of Istanbul, occupy my lowly heart. Own it all and reign supreme. Conquer every rebel power. Let no vice or sin remain. There resists your holy war. You have loved and purchased me. Make me yours forevermore. I was blinded by my sin. Had no ears to hear your voice. Did not know your love within. Had no taste for heaven's joys. Then your spirit gave me life. Opened up your words to me. Through the gospel of your son, gave me endless hope and peace. Help me now to live a life that's dependent on your grace. Keep my heart and guard my soul from the evils that I face. You are worthy to be praised with my every thought and deed. O great God of Istanbul, glorify your name through me. You are worthy to be praised with my every thought and deed. O great God of Istanbul, glorify your name through me. Amen. Okay, a few announcements for everyone before we separate into our groups. One, for all the men, we are having our men's fellowship on Saturday, May 13th. That's going to start at 9 a.m. Pastor Peter Kim will be encouraging us with a sermon. We'll have discussion time and extended fellowship over lunch. So make sure you sign up on that and please go ahead and check the app so you can sign up. Additionally, for new families, recent marriages, etc., there are a couple events happening for the FAM 245 ministry. I know a good number of you guys are here. So check the app for the workshop that's happening on May 20th. And then also check the app for newcomers barbecue that will happen May 13th at 4 p.m. in the afternoon, late afternoon. Aside from that, you guys can check the app and such. But one real quick thing as the session, we have just about a month and a half or so left. Just want to give you an encouragement. Please do try your best to make it here on time so that we can get started together at 7 and go into our worship time. My guess is probably some of you guys are doing meetups and you guys are talking and then you realize, "Oh, shoot, it's 7," and then you run over, you know. Just remember this is open and the cafe is open so you could always just fellowship here as well. Okay? All right. We'll see you guys back here at 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Everybody, let's... for those of you guys in the rooms, please make your way out so that we can begin our study.   Okay.  And then, as they make their way out, I do hope that, you know, as we're doing smaller little paragraphs, and again, I know that maybe conceptually the line breaks or verse breaks may not be in the perfect place, but it helps us walk through three to four verses per week so that we can spend extra time making observation, questions, and application. When I teach up here, sometimes I have a hard time. I want to just unload, like, every word that I looked up or every, you know, connection that I saw. So, if I miss anything, please know that you could always message and we can talk about it after, etc. I hope that you are doing a good, just, even outlining of the segment, trying to define and then also just conclude on what I like to call the meditation part of it, right? What does this mean? How does it look like? What's the opposite of this? When do I see it? When do I not see it? All that kind of stuff is very important for us. Let's pray and then jump into the text. So, God, as we acknowledge that the study of your word, Lord, we know is a spiritual endeavor. We pray for your spirit to wash away any of the false preconceived notions in our minds, things that we're used to, so that, God, we would be open to the newness of mind that you want us to have, the wisdom, the understanding, and the truths that you want us to be convicted of, that we might walk in them. So, bless us, Lord, as we walk through this text. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. For the sake of getting a bit of the section, if you, I just want to make note of the fact that starting from verse 4 through 7, if I were to outline it, would be the section that I would entitle, like, you know, thankful for Philemon. And then starting from verse 8 is where I would lean, go into Apostle Paul's loving appeal. But let me read this section for us, for our purposes, it's good to see our segment encapsulated from verse 4 through 10. I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints. And I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake. For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper, that for love's sake I rather appeal to you, since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus, I appeal to you for my child, Nesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment. Okay. So, when we look at this portion that we're studying from verse 7 through 9, here's the way that I segmented it. Verse 7 I saw clearly as an element of Apostle Paul is affirming Philemon's character. So it's Phil's character, mainly highlighting the fact that Philemon is producing for Apostle Paul great joy, comfort, and your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. So this is affirming the effectiveness of Philemon's faith already. The next part from verse 8 is Paul's loving appeal beginning, where it says, "Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper, yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you." So, you have his character, and then his loving appeal versus a command. Starting with the first segment in verse 7 then. When we take a look at this idea that Apostle Paul is receiving joy and comfort, I do want to ask a couple questions here, and I think the beginning portion of it has a lot to do with just, "Wow, when we look at Philemon's character, we actually kind of saw a lot." What am I talking about? Starting from before, in the previous section as review, we recognize that Philemon had love for Christ and all the saints, yes? And that that love was very visible to the degree that his reputation was very consistent, right? That it wasn't as so much that, like, "Oh, he just had one instance where he did a mighty deed," but rather this individual was marked by a character trait of love, yes? And then, here in verse 7, then it talks about Apostle Paul, where it brings so much joy and comfort to his heart. And we should be asking the question, like, "Wow, I wonder if Philemon did something specifically for Apostle Paul?" You know, maybe Philemon, because he had the resources, was one who was sending Paul in prison, various resources, the books, you know, the cloak, or whatever it may have been. Or, it could very easily be that because of how much Philemon was ministering to the body of Christ at large, Apostle Paul was just feeling the love as Christ would. That in as much as we do things for the body, Christ says, "You do this for me." And so in that way, Apostle Paul is very much encouraged by all of Philemon's deeds. And then on top of that, he adds the idea that he refreshes people's hearts. And so, then when we think about this, okay, when we think about Philemon's character, I want us to kind of take a moment to just start meditating and think, like, "Wow." Clearly, I could see why Apostle Paul has a lot of great confidence that ultimately Philemon will do the right thing. Yeah? Like, here's an individual whose character is already pointing to the fact that it's generous, it's giving, it's sacrificial, it's humble, you know what I'm saying? And that's why Apostle Paul's confidence is going towards him, thinking, "I almost don't need to command you forcefully like that." Because you're already engaged in the ministry this way. And so, again, meditating for the sake of my own sanctification, I start wondering, like, "Hmm, this actually has quite a lot for me to meditate on. Am I, one, producing joy in the people that interact with me? Am I someone who is joyous in my own demeanor? Or do I just cause a lot of awkwardness?" You know? As I walk around church, what am I spreading here? Great comfort, right? A sense of I'm drawn near to you, and you feel the sentiment of, like, "Wow, this individual is willing to come to my aid." The idea of comfort has the idea of the paraclete. It's almost like the Holy Spirit coming alongside and walking beside you in great encouragement, right? Great confidence. And then also, there's this, just again, I guess you could say, compare and contrast, that there are individuals who are just naturally encouraging by what they just do. They don't have to directly do something towards me, right? Am I that, am I such an individual? We know those individuals who are kind of recluse, not willing to draw near, but rather standoffish, or are they willing, very open to the community? There are some people who are constantly giving, and then there are those people who are constantly needy. There are some individuals who have an incredible amount of love to give. They just got a lot of love to give. And then there are those people who just say, "Man, that person just needs a lot of love." Okay? But sometimes we can just meditate and ask the question, like, "What is my general reputation? How do people see me? What's the effect I have on this community?" And it's not so much that I have to do something for every single individual, but am I refreshing the saints? And in my group, an individual just said, "Man, like sometimes when I hear someone have an 'aha' moment, they're studying the Bible and they're just like, 'Doh! Dude! You know what we need to do?' And then they have conviction, and they're speaking boldly and frankly and precisely according to the Scriptures. They feel this weird prick conviction in their heart, and then they feel refreshed. Because by the word of God, their own heart's growing. Yeah? We can do that for each other. And that would create such a natural element and atmosphere of encouragement towards one another. Amen? Okay. So, as we meditate on that, from this, Apostle Paul says, "So therefore, though I have enough confidence," and we should ask the question of, like, is this confidence actually in Philemon, saying, like, "Though I, Paul, can't speak to you this way," you know, what is he saying there? "In Christ, to order you to do what is proper, yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you." Okay? And so we should definitely ask this question. Clearly he's setting up this, like, "I could go down this path where I need you to accept Anisimus, and I sent him to you so I can tell you, like, I sent him, and just like he obeyed me, you better obey me too." Right? But he says, "No, no. Instead, yet, I want to do it where it's for the love's sake, and I'm going to appeal to you in a way of almost requesting." So, I asked an interesting question of, like, that's strange because in the end it would have the same effect, wouldn't it? Well, I posed that question to you. Would it? Would it in the end have the same effect if Apostle Paul just said, "I'm in prison. I'm not going to waste my breath just trying to convince you. Just do what I say." Okay? Versus, "Let me tell you a long story of all that I've done, and now that I'm in prison," right? Like, trying to reason and convince him. Is it the same effect? And the other part of it too, I just said, "Man, Apostle Paul, he definitely has a lot of weight and authority. He's an apostle. But what's more, he would have every biblical command starting from the Gospels because Jesus himself said, like, "Whenever you stand praying, forgive. If you have anything against anyone so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions." But, and Jesus himself gave a stern warning, "If you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions." Yes? So, Apostle Paul can just say, reiterate that you have heard what Jesus said, and give a lot of weight. Here's another passage, as you know, if we're talking about some of the more powerful, authoritative commands for you to forgive one another. Jesus gave this parable. Peter asked this question. "Then Peter came and said to him, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?' Up to seven times. And Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you, "Up to seven times," but "Up to seventy times." Seven." And then Jesus starts telling this parable of the merciless slave who was shown much mercy. Remember that? He was forgiven so much incredible debt by the master, but as soon as he's free and goes away, he finds the fellow slave who owes him, and even though the fellow slave is begging, "Just give me more time! Give me a chance!" The merciless slave said, "No. I need to pay." And then so, this is what Jesus says to end the parable. "Then summoning him, his lord said to him, 'You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?' And his lord moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers, until he should repay all that was owed him. My heavenly father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brothers from your heart." Okay. So we're staring at this passage, and we're talking about the authority of Apostle Paul and his ability to just command that Philemon forgive, versus the love sake. My question that we have to ask is, clearly, clearly, Apostle Paul is saying, "It's so much better, it's so much wiser that I appeal to you in this way, but why?" Now, I'm going to leave that for you guys to discuss. Why is it wiser and better? But here are a couple things. I do want to make mention of the fact that in order for Philemon to give grace, he has to absorb the cost of the offense. Yes? And therefore, in order for it to be grace, he has to be able to give that grace freely. Right? He has to be willing to show that mercy. What's more, Apostle Paul clearly had in mind his close relationship with Philemon. And commanding Philemon to do something, that's a kind of like an authority card, a trump card you present in very unique circumstances. Right? And Apostle Paul would have to exercise his wisdom, like, "Do I need to do that now? Or better yet, Apostle Paul literally told us, "No, I have confidence that Philemon can do much better." Yes? And I just want to make mention of this. I think no matter what circumstance you're in, whether you're in a huge corporation or small, there are times when we talk, you know, amongst guys or whatever, and sometimes people talk about, "Oh my goodness, the management at company, jokers, you know, morons. They don't know what they're doing." I'm kind of like, "Shh." And then there are people who are managers, who are people up in like higher positions, like, "Oh my gosh, these subordinates, they don't know what they're doing, idiots." You know? Now, they don't say it like that, but sometimes you hear this kind of grumbling. I was kind of meditating on that and talking about it at home. It's like, it is easy to critique from afar. And the reason why it's like that is because sometimes there's no relationship. You realize that when people like very quickly, easily critique their aptitude, their effectiveness, and all this kind of stuff, it kind of shows like there probably isn't a relationship between manager and employee or whatever it may be. Right? And that's kind of a big gap in which even in Christian ministry, when there is no relationship, you can throw critiques around everywhere. You're not effective here, you're not doing this, it's just all over the place. And so I wanted to mention that. But lastly, I want to make mention of this. Clearly, submission to authority in the church and Christian ministry is in the Bible. Book of Hebrews and Timothy's. But, obedience to your church leader is not the same as obedience to Christ himself. And obviously, I don't need to state what supersedes the other. Right? Like what brings joy to our God? And so, on top of that, we have plenty of scriptures where God very explicitly said, "I desire mercy and not just sacrifice." Right? Philemon can be doing all sorts of things for the church. But if he in this moment, perhaps went the other way where he was resistant, grumbling, focused on his offense, and all he did was, "You know what? If you say so, Apostle Paul, I'll do it." And he wasn't doing it from the heart, then there's no way we can be like, "Yes, God was pleased through all of this." You know what I'm saying? And so that also then paints a little bit of a picture as why at our church too, we're trying to be very cognizant. Are we going to have a form of moving the congregation and discipling the congregation where it allows for people to know, yes, the high standards of God, yes, the expectations and the model he has for us, while bearing genuine fruit because we see the conviction from Christ. Versus, "Well, last Wednesday, Pastor Mark said..." Those are two very different stories. Okay, then we conclude with, Apostle Paul says, "You know, I am appealing to you. I'm not commanding you, but I'm appealing to you since I am such a person as Paul, the aged and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus." So if you remember, I said, even in this little sentence, you should try to list off because he has multiple points that he's actually making. He is saying, we don't normally talk like this, like, "I am such a person as Mark." Right? Like, what is he really saying there? And in some sense, I mean, if Apostle Paul wanted to do like a credentials list, right? He could point to 2 Corinthians 11 and start listing off everything from, you know, the beatings, and he lists multiple beatings. And he's like, you know, the hardships, and he lists multiple hardships and the shipwreck and the pain and the loneliness, the homelessness, the hunger, the sleeplessness, and more. Right? So we have a lot that Apostle Paul can say, and he adds the idea that he's aged, which literally just means he's old. Right? If you study this portion at this time, a lot of people assume he's in his early 60s. And at the time then, he's already then, you know, showing that age. And then he says, "And not only that, and now I'm a prisoner." So what is Apostle Paul talking about? Why does he use this as a means to talk about the reason why he's making the appeal? I do think that we have, I guess you can say, what I like to call a beautiful light of Christ. Okay? Now, summarize it with this. In one sense, Apostle Paul can be just saying like, "Man, I'm just asking you to forgive Philemon. It's not as though I'm asking you to do this." It's kind of a very, like, "Look at me and all that I suffered. Don't compare what I'm about to ask you to do with what I've been through." That's one way you could read it, potentially. But the other way you can see it is, Apostle Paul is just highlighting the fact that in his own love for Christ and all the saints, he's lived a life of sacrifice and shared in the fellowship of this faith, just like Philemon already has, too. It's led him down a lifelong journey, right? Or from the moment of his conversion up until this point, of sacrifice, dying to self, and an incredible volitional, volitional emptying of himself for the sake of the people. And in that way, he gets his eyes, yes, like, when there's an offense in our lives, we should be able to objectively define, "What is the offense? Is it sin?" And if it is, we should be able to, by conviction, say, "That's sin." Right? We should be very objective and precise in the way that we judge things. However, in forgiveness, you don't fix your eyes on the offense, do you? Why? Because if you're fixing your eyes on the offense, you're going to replay it, you're going to tell other people and then replay it, you're going to replay it in terms of the defense and the accusation you're going to play, and then that replaying of the offense, the only way to fix it is to condemn it, is to make the other person pay for the offense. What does Christ do for us? Christ gets our eyes off the offense and looks at all the suffering, the forbearance, the patience, and the willing absorbing of the cost of that offense on his body. He is the inspiration by which we know the offense is paid for. My offense is paid for. His offense is paid for when he repents in Christ. Yes? There is a solution to the offense outside of just him. And so in that way, Apostle Paul serves as a light of Christ. Right? And in many ways, I think that's why Apostle Paul talks about, I want to share in the sufferings of Christ. He says that. How does he do that? Because in the same way we would, each time we forgive, we will absorb. We will absorb the cost of love. We will bear. We'll have a long-suffering kind of love that we give to one another. And so in that way, I feel like Apostle Paul is just both exemplifying and bringing the attention of a lifelong, right? A lifelong kind of reflection of Christ in the self-giving, sacrificial love that he has. And so from there, he's going to move into the next week where he gives his actual appeal and says, "I present to you, Anisimus, like I'm presenting you my heart." Let's take a moment to pray. Lord, we thank you that Christ to us, Lord God, is a purity of love given. We thank you, God, that you are not just simply a harsh taskmaster that says, "I see sin in you," and he stomps it out. But God, he gives a path for reconciliation. Lord, thank you that you are not just simply on a mission to eradicate all things wrong and fix every problem, but rather you say that it was in your heart to reconcile and dwell with your children. That God, you wanted to have a deep, loving relationship, and therefore you made grace what it is, something you lavished on us freely, willingly, and free of charge. So Lord, we want to thank you and pray that as we get challenged with every little element of what it required for these two individuals in history to reconcile with one another, I pray, God, that we would be both inspired, that we too would desire, we would have a sense of longing to have reconciliation be a regular part of our lives. We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. So just for a way of discussion, I just wanted to, whoops, oh no. Okay. Highlight the fact that next week is verse 10 through 13, and then the following after that of 519 is our praise and prayer, so we will be on a one-week break there. I don't necessarily have any specific instructions for the next passage. We're just going to continue on doing close observations and questions. And then for discussion questions, I have a couple here. First, I know sometimes, I just got to be honest, making discussion questions is difficult. First, I do ask this strange question, or I guess you could say awkward, not strange, but how do people think of you in your near circles? Okay. So basically I am talking about your reputation. Now, you don't have to be overly critical of yourself, but remember how we did the, hey, you know, sometimes, some people are more joyous naturally, and et cetera, et cetera, but it presents an opportunity for us to ask, am I a refreshment? Or am I sometimes kind of a burden? Am I a source of this and comfort? Or do people feel like they're just walking on eggshells around me because of the way I react? It's sometimes just good to take self-assessment, okay? So think about that. Two, what does happen if things are not done out of love, but by law or policy? Things like love, grace, mercy, sympathy, charity. You know, if we just said, you know what, everybody in the room, you have to give to this charity because you just have to as a way of policy. What does that do to charity? And I want you guys to discuss that. Next, what does this passage teach us about the use of authority? I know that's really vague and broad, but just discuss a little bit about maybe case scenarios of when is it good to not use the authority and just allow for the individuals to make their own decisions, et cetera. And then lastly, have you ever rejected advice from someone because you felt they didn't have the right to say? Why is it that the same thing can be advised, but depending on who says it, it matters to us, okay? And that's just obviously focusing on the idea that also Paul is speaking with a lot of his own example and weight. And so why does that element contribute to our decision making or even just the receptiveness of our heart? Okay, thanks everyone.</p></div></body></html>
