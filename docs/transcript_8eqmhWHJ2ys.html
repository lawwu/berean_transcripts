Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name. Give me an undivided heart. No other gods, no other love, no other gods before you. No other gods, no other love, no other gods before you. Let's pray. Lord God, we just thank you for again just the privilege that you give us to come here and meet, to study your word freely.</p><p>We pray, Lord God, with just everything going on in our lives that we would truly just seek you with all our heart, that you would be our our number one desire, that our hearts would be just dedicated to you, that we would always remember what we have in Christ, and just the sacrifice that you made for us, and that in response we would just desire to pursue you with all our heart, that we would desire to know you more.</p><p>And I pray, Lord, that as we just discuss your word, that it would just be fruitful discussions and be with us, give us strength tonight. In your name we pray, amen. Amen. Okay, so I do have a couple important announcements for us. Again, as an encouragement, please do sign up to volunteer.</p><p>Here at church on the Wednesday night we have, you know... Please make sure to ask some of the questions, important questions that we asked in the previous study, which is, what's the purpose? What's the generic flow that allowed us to arrive at this paragraph? And then think about, even within the paragraph, what's the argument and what's the flow, etc.</p><p>And then start diving into what are your questions, what are your observations, etc. And then we'll come back here again at 7.50. Okay? Thank you. Make your way on out. I hope you guys had good discussion. It's a little bit ringy still. Sometimes the... I feel like there's a ghost in our system.</p><p>It's all like set to previous stuff but it gets a little bit messed up. As people are getting situated Hey, is it better if I use a handheld or I can? As people are getting situated a long time ago I had taught a harmonious class but that class I just went like here's the rule and like ten examples you know different passages.</p><p>Truthfully picking a passage for each week proved to be really difficult for this series. So if you're wondering like why did Pastor Mark choose this one? It's not because I wanted to make it all spicy and just stir the pot. It's because this passage as you know has a lot of different perspectives and people have a lot of different opinions and it helps us actually exercise some of the hermeneutical principles we need to learn.</p><p>Plus it's a passage that a lot of people have given up on and said so many books and so many pastors and theologians have studied this we're never going to know. So for us as Bible students then it's like okay we'll take the challenge. Challenge accepted. Let's take a moment to take a look at this portion of Psalms as a means to ready our hearts and pray.</p><p>It says, "My soul cleaves to the dust. Revive me according to your word. I have told of my ways and you have answered me. Teach me your statutes. Make me understand the way of your precepts so I will meditate on your wonders. My soul weeps because of grief. Strengthen me according to your word.</p><p>Remove the false way from me and graciously grant me your law. I have chosen the faithful way. I have placed your ordinances before me. I cling to your testimonies oh Lord. Do not put me to shame. I shall run the way of your commandments for you." For really ministering to us.</p><p>Father God I pray that although sometimes we will experience great difficulty applying your word. Although sometimes we will experience your word just shattering what we take to be normative or what we are used to. But help us to know just as the psalmist says, God that your word is so good.</p><p>We will be blessed in keeping it. And God it's to our blessedness if we devote ourselves to both the study and the application of your truth. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Common errors that we see that wasn't to just like poke fun at what people say.</p><p>I want to make a comment like please do not be what I like to call word police of each other. If someone says that reminds me of a story don't be like hey! Pastor Mike talked about you in that article. But that's just to say sometimes we have this inclination and so we just need to be aware.</p><p>One of the things I mentioned was in some sense Bible study should be pretty straightforward. Bible study should be like we're seeking clarity and so we're just observing the stuff that's obvious. But don't be afraid of sounding boring or obvious because the point is to get at what he plainly says.</p><p>The other article about historical grammatical we just wanted you to know that yes even well intended theological systems or approaches where people come to the Bible looking for stuff will have an error of trying to dig, dig, dig expecting to find what they wanted to find versus what the author is intending to give us.</p><p>So it has to go this direction. Find what the author intended and we arrive at that conclusion. With that said, let's take a look at 1 Timothy 2 9 through 15 and I'll take a moment to read it for us. I know you guys have been staring at it for the last 40 minutes but let's take a minute to read.</p><p>Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing modestly and discreetly not with braided hair.</p></div></body></html>
