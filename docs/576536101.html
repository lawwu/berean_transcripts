class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=105">00:01:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">At age 19, my former discipler, he encouraged me to go to this church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=110">00:01:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">His friend was planting a church and wanted to go help out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=112">00:01:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I became a youth pastor at 19, just out of, again, just to be obedient to my discipler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=122">00:02:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I've been in ministry since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=124">00:02:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of things that I did as a young youth pastor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=129">00:02:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was a youth pastor, I think, from 19 to about 24, 25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=132">00:02:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I went to the college ministry, and then after that, the young adults, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=135">00:02:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we ended up planting this church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=138">00:02:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of things that I did early on that I probably would not do now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=144">00:02:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that I remember very distinctly was I got a cassette tape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=152">00:02:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Those of you guys remember what cassette tapes are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=155">00:02:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the tape basically was a recording of a demonic encounter that this live radio program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=162">00:02:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">guy was having.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=163">00:02:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he wanted me to listen to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=165">00:02:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I listened to it, and I said, "Oh, it's very shocking."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=168">00:02:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought, "Oh, this would be a good idea to let the kids listen to it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=172">00:02:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I remember Elder Joe was also in the youth group at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=176">00:02:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think he's the only one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=177">00:02:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You were there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=178">00:02:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, he was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=179">00:02:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was one of the guys who got traumatized that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=182">00:03:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just happened the night that I was playing that audio, it was raining and thundering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=189">00:03:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was up in the darker part of the church, Irvine Baptist, that I was at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=195">00:03:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then basically the recording is, it was kind of like that live Bible program, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=199">00:03:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible Answer Man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=200">00:03:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people would just randomly call in and ask questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=204">00:03:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this young girl, I think she said she was maybe like 15 or 16 years old, she called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=210">00:03:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and she seemed so disoriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=213">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could tell that in the beginning, they didn't know how to deal with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=215">00:03:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, "I don't know why I called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=217">00:03:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I just pulled over and something led me to call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=219">00:03:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not exactly sure where I'm calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=221">00:03:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=223">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">In the beginning, it sounds like a prank call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=226">00:03:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But as they are having this conversation, she started to say things like how she was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=231">00:03:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">raised in a satanic home and that her whole upbringing was to prepare her for this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=238">00:03:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=239">00:03:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so initially it sounded like, "Is this a prank call?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=244">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is all recording live on the radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=247">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could tell back and forth that even the hosts are kind of caught off guard not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=250">00:04:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to know how to deal with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=252">00:04:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they started to share the gospel with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=255">00:04:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then she said, when he mentioned the name Jesus, her response was shocking because she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=261">00:04:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Who is this Jesus, this man?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=264">00:04:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Does he want to have sexual relations with me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=267">00:04:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously it's blasphemous what she was saying, but the radio host is just caught</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=271">00:04:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">off guard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=272">00:04:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said that's the only thing that she knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=274">00:04:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So ever since she was a child, that this happened to her repeatedly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=279">00:04:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this supposedly was to prepare her for some sacrifice that they were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=284">00:04:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=285">00:04:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you can tell that the radio host is also kind of like trying to figure this out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=290">00:04:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this real?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=291">00:04:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this a prank call?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=293">00:04:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the middle of sharing the gospel with her, this is on live radio, her voice changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=299">00:04:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">into a demonic voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=301">00:05:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's dead silence for about 10 seconds because you can tell the hosts were trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=305">00:05:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure out, is this real or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=308">00:05:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the demon begins to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=311">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the recording is that encounter that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=315">00:05:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This was recorded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=318">00:05:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't even listen to the whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=320">00:05:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I just thought this was pretty shocking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=321">00:05:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just that, in my wisdom, I thought this would be great for our youth group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=327">00:05:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that time, I think Officer Joe was probably 13, 14 at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=332">00:05:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, something about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=333">00:05:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had children as young as 12, maybe even younger, all the way up to 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=339">00:05:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end of the recording, it was maybe about 10, 15 minute recording.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101&t=345">00:05:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just happened to be exactly that same day, two years before.</span></div><div
