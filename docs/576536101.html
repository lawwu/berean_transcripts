class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=105s">00:01:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">At age 19, my former discipler, he encouraged me to go to this church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=110s">00:01:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">His friend was planting a church and wanted to go help out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=112s">00:01:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I became a youth pastor at 19, just out of, again, just to be obedient to my discipler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=122s">00:02:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I've been in ministry since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=124s">00:02:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of things that I did as a young youth pastor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=129s">00:02:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was a youth pastor, I think, from 19 to about 24, 25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=132s">00:02:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I went to the college ministry, and then after that, the young adults, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=135s">00:02:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we ended up planting this church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=138s">00:02:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of things that I did early on that I probably would not do now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=144s">00:02:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that I remember very distinctly was I got a cassette tape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=152s">00:02:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Those of you guys remember what cassette tapes are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=155s">00:02:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the tape basically was a recording of a demonic encounter that this live radio program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=162s">00:02:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">guy was having.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=163s">00:02:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he wanted me to listen to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=165s">00:02:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I listened to it, and I said, "Oh, it's very shocking."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=168s">00:02:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought, "Oh, this would be a good idea to let the kids listen to it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=172s">00:02:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I remember Elder Joe was also in the youth group at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=176s">00:02:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think he's the only one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=177s">00:02:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You were there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=178s">00:02:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, he was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=179s">00:02:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was one of the guys who got traumatized that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=182s">00:03:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just happened the night that I was playing that audio, it was raining and thundering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=189s">00:03:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was up in the darker part of the church, Irvine Baptist, that I was at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=195s">00:03:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then basically the recording is, it was kind of like that live Bible program, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=199s">00:03:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible Answer Man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=200s">00:03:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people would just randomly call in and ask questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=204s">00:03:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this young girl, I think she said she was maybe like 15 or 16 years old, she called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=210s">00:03:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and she seemed so disoriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=213s">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could tell that in the beginning, they didn't know how to deal with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=215s">00:03:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, "I don't know why I called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=217s">00:03:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I just pulled over and something led me to call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=219s">00:03:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not exactly sure where I'm calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=221s">00:03:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=223s">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">In the beginning, it sounds like a prank call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=226s">00:03:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But as they are having this conversation, she started to say things like how she was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=231s">00:03:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">raised in a satanic home and that her whole upbringing was to prepare her for this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=238s">00:03:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=239s">00:03:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so initially it sounded like, "Is this a prank call?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=244s">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is all recording live on the radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=247s">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could tell back and forth that even the hosts are kind of caught off guard not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=250s">00:04:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to know how to deal with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=252s">00:04:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they started to share the gospel with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=255s">00:04:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then she said, when he mentioned the name Jesus, her response was shocking because she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=261s">00:04:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Who is this Jesus, this man?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=264s">00:04:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Does he want to have sexual relations with me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=267s">00:04:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously it's blasphemous what she was saying, but the radio host is just caught</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=271s">00:04:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">off guard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=272s">00:04:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said that's the only thing that she knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=274s">00:04:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So ever since she was a child, that this happened to her repeatedly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=279s">00:04:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this supposedly was to prepare her for some sacrifice that they were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=284s">00:04:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=285s">00:04:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you can tell that the radio host is also kind of like trying to figure this out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=290s">00:04:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this real?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=293s">00:04:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the middle of sharing the gospel with her, this is on live radio, her voice changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=299s">00:04:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">into a demonic voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=301s">00:05:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's dead silence for about 10 seconds because you can tell the hosts were trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=305s">00:05:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure out, is this real or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=311s">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the recording is that encounter that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=315s">00:05:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This was recorded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/576536101#t=318s">00:05:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't even listen to the whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
