praise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=140s">00:02:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and prayer night, and so we just had one this last Friday, but we're also very aware that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=147s">00:02:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">meeting together once a month is not enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=151s">00:02:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The early church was devoted to prayer, and so we want to make sure that we're devoted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=154s">00:02:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to praying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=156s">00:02:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So another thing that we wanted to implement is try to implement more corporate prayer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=160s">00:02:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in Sunday service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=162s">00:02:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had various discussions, and the conclusion that we came to, without disrupting what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=167s">00:02:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">happening already, is that what we're going to do, starting from not next Sunday, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=171s">00:02:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the Sunday after that, when Elder Joe is back up here leading worship, we're going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=177s">00:02:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a shorter worship service in the front, and then the main worship time is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=182s">00:03:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">after the sermon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=183s">00:03:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not going to be a major change, it's going to be just priority in the worship after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=190s">00:03:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the sermon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=191s">00:03:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason we're doing that is, one, I think we worship better, you know, oftentimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=197s">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">after we hear the Word of God and are convicted, and also we want to give extra time for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=202s">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to respond in prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=204s">00:03:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So during that time, as we are worshiping, as the Lord leads, that our church would spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=209s">00:03:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">extended period, again, if you want to sit down, stand up, and just really come before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=214s">00:03:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord in praying together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=217s">00:03:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, we're not saying that that is enough, but we're trying to implement more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=222s">00:03:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">ways that our church can be more mindful of how we are desperately in need of prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=228s">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one of the things that we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=229s">00:03:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So Friday, praise and prayer, and also on Sunday, we're going to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=233s">00:03:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, we're going to implement that in a couple weeks, and we'll give you a heads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=236s">00:03:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">up before that happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=237s">00:03:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, Elder Joe is going to lead us in that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=243s">00:04:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Prayer, as we've mentioned on Friday, and as I've been talking about, is one of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/267327611#t=247s">00:04:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">disciplines that you just absolutely cannot do in the
