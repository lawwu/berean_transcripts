is to be set apart, to be different from the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=134s">00:02:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the

and why this is so significant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=139s">00:02:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=140s">00:02:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he spells out at the very end, in conclusion of chapter 11 through 15, that the first reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=146s">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">given why all of these is given is to keep you

part, is to prevent death by defiling God's holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=155s">00:02:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=156s">00:02:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember when we started the book of Leviticus, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=160s">00:02:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember in Exodus, God establishes a tabernacle, but he's up in the mountain?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=166s">00:02:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Book of Leviticus, God comes down and he's speaking from the tabernacle, but they can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=171s">00:02:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">come in because it's not established yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=173s">00:02:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we go to Numbers, God calls them into the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=176s">00:02:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole purpose of this tabernacle is so that God's holy presence can dwell with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=181s">00:03:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">his people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=182s">00:03:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the people are not clean, if they are not covered and they're not clean, what would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=187s">00:03:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">happen to them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=189s">00:03:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They would die, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=191s">00:03:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what he is saying here is that the purpose of these laws is so, one, so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=197s">00:03:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they would be kept clean, and secondly, so they would not die in their uncleanness when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=201s">00:03:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the presence of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=203s">00:03:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Understand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=204s">00:03:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that's pretty much the summary of the last four chapters that we were looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=213s">00:03:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So just as a quick review, chapter 11 through 15, it varies in seriousness and duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=220s">00:03:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">All of the laws were to describe or teachings about how to identify what is clean and unclean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=227s">00:03:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">but they are all varying in seriousness and duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=232s">00:03:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one, we start in chapter 11, the uncleanness that is talked about with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=238s">00:03:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the animals are permanent, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=241s">00:04:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The food and the animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=243s">00:04:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was a regular part of who they were, and it was a permanent part of their lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=248s">00:04:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so this never changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=249s">00:04:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">These animals who are declared unclean are unclean permanently, and these certain things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=255s">00:04:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that he says are clean are clean permanently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=258s">00:04:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The second one, that's with chapter 12, again, depending on what was going on through childbirth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=265s">00:04:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it could last up to 80 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=270s">00:04:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not permanent, but the duration was a bit longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=274s">00:04:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter 13, the skin disease, could be permanent because there was no cure for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=283s">00:04:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and the duration could have been permanent, ultimately leading to death, unless God showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=287s">00:04:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy and the skin disease gets cured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=290s">00:04:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the final one today in chapter 15, that it deals with uncleanness associated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=297s">00:04:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with discharge, associated with reproduction, which only lasts one day or up to seven days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=304s">00:05:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So considering all the different laws that were given to us starting from chapter 11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=309s">00:05:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 15 is probably the lightest of all the laws, and the consequences of it is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=316s">00:05:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the lightest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=319s">00:05:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you were defiled in any way, the duration in which you were to be isolated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=325s">00:05:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or to be unclean, most of the time would have been just one day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=329s">00:05:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You would have just washed your hands and washed your clothes, taken a bath, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=333s">00:05:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">would have been considered unclean until the rest of the night, and then tomorrow morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=336s">00:05:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you would be considered clean, unless you had some abnormal discharge, and that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=341s">00:05:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">take you about seven days, and the eighth day you would be restored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=345s">00:05:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And same thing with the women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=347s">00:05:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now again, all of this is going to mean something at the end, but for the time being, just as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=352s">00:05:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a summary of what is stated in chapter 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=354s">00:05:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So out of all the four different types of uncleanness, this is probably the lightest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=364s">00:06:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The seriousness of the leprosy that we looked at in verse 13 and 14 points to the need for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=371s">00:06:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=372s">00:06:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember we talked about how other than the mercy of God, there was no cure for leprosy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=379s">00:06:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And every part of the law of leprosy, the ugliness of what it brought and the damage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=383s">00:06:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that it created, the isolation, and ultimately they were cast out outside the camp, and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=392s">00:06:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">they had to do, were able to do, is either wait for the disease to take its course and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/270990362#t=399s">00:06:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">then
