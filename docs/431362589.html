class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/431362589#t=224s">00:03:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the modern day translation for that is when people say, "I am Christ," they're basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/431362589#t=228s">00:03:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "I am speaking the truth.</span></div><div
