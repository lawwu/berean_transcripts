href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=110s">00:01:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We could have probably just spent just a whole day just on one of these festivals because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=114s">00:01:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's so much involved, not only the details of the meaning behind it, but how it's fulfilled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=120s">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=121s">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in every one of these festivals, there's a clear fulfillment in Christ, and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=125s">00:02:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so many passages in the New Testament that we could have covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=128s">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Jesus mentions it in the book of Revelation and the Gospels, and Paul brings it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=132s">00:02:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I was preparing, the study was just getting longer and longer and longer, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=136s">00:02:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there's just no way that I would have been able to sit there and talk about each one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=140s">00:02:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things in that detail, and so nor did I want to just kind of skim over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=145s">00:02:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way I organized it today is the seven festivals, and kind of give you an overarching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=151s">00:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons behind what He did and how it points to certain specific things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=155s">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are going to go into some of the details, but again, if you study thoroughly through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=160s">00:02:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 23, there's a lot of little things that are mentioned there that I'm just not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=166s">00:02:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to mention in today's Bible study just because there's a lot of things to cover,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=170s">00:02:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm just going to give you a large overview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=172s">00:02:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to mention the significant things, but again, I'm not going to be able to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=175s">00:02:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">into too much detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=177s">00:02:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So to jump right in, the chapter begins with the command to observe the Sabbath on a weekly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=184s">00:03:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=185s">00:03:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in verses 1, 2, and 3, before He gets into the seventh feast, starting from chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=191s">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">4, He begins with the practice of Sabbath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=194s">00:03:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So Sabbath, obviously, is not one of the seventh feasts, but the reason why He gave the Sabbath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=199s">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the nation of Israel is the same reason why He gave the seventh feast, and this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=204s">00:03:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the only one that He does on a weekly basis, where every single week on Saturday, on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=209s">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sabbath, they were to take time off and not engage in work, all for the purpose of renewing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=214s">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">their covenant, renewing their relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=218s">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So restoring the Sabbath, if you, again, you probably may have heard a sermon at our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=225s">00:03:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at some point, is ultimately the purpose of redemption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=230s">00:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the creation account, God creates in six days, and seventh day, He enters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=235s">00:03:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Sabbath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=236s">00:03:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know that God didn't enter Sabbath because He needed a break and recuperate and start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=241s">00:04:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">over the next day, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=243s">00:04:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of times we think of Sabbath that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=244s">00:04:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The Sabbath, the way it's described in the scripture, is God enters the rest, and He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=250s">00:04:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is there permanently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=251s">00:04:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so He brings us into that rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=253s">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So when sin comes in, that Sabbath that we had in the presence of God is broken, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=260s">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So when somebody is in sin, another way to describe it is unrest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=266s">00:04:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why, again, when we study the book of Hebrews, He describes salvation as entering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=271s">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the Sabbath, and He says to make every effort to enter into that Sabbath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=276s">00:04:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the practice of Sabbath, ultimately, the restoration of Sabbath, the true Sabbath found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=281s">00:04:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ, is another way to describe salvation itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=285s">00:04:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can say the whole redemptive history is to bring us back to that seventh day Sabbath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=290s">00:04:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that God entered, that was broken when sin came into the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=296s">00:04:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The Sabbath served as a sign between God and His covenant people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=300s">00:05:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And details of this are not mentioned all of it in Exodus 23, or Leviticus 23.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=305s">00:05:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all over the book of Exodus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=307s">00:05:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in the book of Deuteronomy and other parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=310s">00:05:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to reference that, but a lot of these things may not be specifically mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=314s">00:05:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in chapter 23.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then He says, "It is the Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=321s">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is commanded by God, that this is something that they were...it was not a suggestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=328s">00:05:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the penalty for breaking the Sabbath was capital punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=334s">00:05:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">To break the Sabbath and to disrespect the Sabbath basically meant to basically shake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=339s">00:05:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your fist at God and saying, "I don't need you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=342s">00:05:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was a very serious thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=344s">00:05:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though He lays out these seven feasts and this

you put it all together, it might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=426s">00:07:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">total of maybe about three weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=429s">00:07:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Jewish calendar, if you put all of that together, and the seven feasts were only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=436s">00:07:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the major things, but there's a lot of other things that they celebrate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=439s">00:07:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the Jewish calendar, we're talking about a huge chunk of time in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=443s">00:07:23.480</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=449s">00:07:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that these feasts are literally called appointed times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=454s">00:07:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In the ESV and the NASV, it says it's holy convocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=460s">00:07:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In the NIV, it's called the sacred assembly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=465s">00:07:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically it means that this was an appointed, sacred convocation that was supposed to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=469s">00:07:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">set apart each year during this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=477s">00:07:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">These times were celebrations, these times of celebration are important not only to Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=482s">00:08:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but also to overall message of the biblical narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=486s">00:08:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason why these seven feasts are so important for us to study is because ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=490s">00:08:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it finds fulfillment in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=492s">00:08:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's something about these feasts that helps us better understand what Christ did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=499s">00:08:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on the cross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=502s">00:08:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not only relevant for Israel's history, but also for us in the new covenant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=506s">00:08:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's seven specific feasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=510s">00:08:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The Passover is the beginning in the Jewish calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=515s">00:08:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of First Fruit, Feast of Weeks, oftentimes called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=520s">00:08:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Feast of Pentecost, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Feast of Tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=525s">00:08:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to be looking at the three significances of these seven feasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=536s">00:08:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I mentioned to you, I can go into detail on each one of these feasts and spend the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=541s">00:09:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whole day just talking about what the Feast of Tabernacle did and why God commanded that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=545s">00:09:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and what they practiced and what did these practices point to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=549s">00:09:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we had more time, I think it would be beneficial to do that, but to do that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=554s">00:09:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">would have to take seven weeks because each one of them has that much material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=559s">00:09:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Not necessarily in Leviticus, but if you collect all the other passages, there's quite a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=565s">00:09:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=566s">00:09:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way that we're going to be approaching it tonight is to give you an overview of why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=570s">00:09:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=571s">00:09:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's three significances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=573s">00:09:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">One is it pointed to a current blessing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=577s">00:09:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So every one of these things, these feasts, are attached to some kind of agricultural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=583s">00:09:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">harvest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=585s">00:09:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wasn't random, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=588s">00:09:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had a Feast of Tabernacle, they celebrated because of something physical that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=594s">00:09:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">was happening at that time of the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=598s">00:09:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The second significance was to celebrate historical blessings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=603s">00:10:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So every one of these festivals reminded them of some activity of God, something that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=610s">00:10:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">did for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=612s">00:10:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they took time off to remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=617s">00:10:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the ultimate fulfillment, the third, they all had a prophetic message that pointed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=622s">00:10:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to the fulfillment in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=625s">00:10:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember those three, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=628s">00:10:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's connected to some kind of harvest that was going on, and during that harvest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=635s">00:10:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they remembered something in Israel's history, right, that triggered that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=642s">00:10:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the ultimate fulfillment ultimately pointed to what Christ was going to do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=648s">00:10:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So every one of these feasts had three specific elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=655s">00:10:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at the first one, the current blessing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=658s">00:10:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The feasts all had certain harvests attached to it to be celebrated when to give thanks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=665s">00:11:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for fruitfulness and to acknowledge the worship of God for a particular harvest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=669s">00:11:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the reason behind this is to make sure that whatever physical blessings that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=679s">00:11:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">had, that they were to constantly acknowledge their dependence on God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=684s">00:11:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So even in the Lord's Prayer, you know how we pray to give us this day our daily bread,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=688s">00:11:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and we talked about that last week, how that wasn't just triggered because of the manna,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=693s">00:11:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that was embedded into the Levitical system that people understood that their daily sustenance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=699s">00:11:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">was dependent upon God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=701s">00:11:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so part of the reason for these feasts was whenever they had the harvest of any kind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=708s">00:11:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it would remind them and point them to recognize that they had the rain because of God, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=714s">00:11:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the harvest was fruitful because of God, that they're able to eat and to live and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=720s">00:12:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">their being ultimately because of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=721s">00:12:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's to acknowledge God, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=725s">00:12:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So these harvests that triggered these feasts, first three of them are spring feasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=736s">00:12:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the beginning of their calendar usually started somewhere in March and April, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=741s">00:12:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the spring feasts, they were Passover, Feast of Unleavened Bread, and Feast of First</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=746s">00:12:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=747s">00:12:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They were all triggered because of the beginning of the harvest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=754s">00:12:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now so you had the harvest of the wheat, harvest of the barley, and so each one of them are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=758s">00:12:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">attached to a different festival, but overall, the spring feasts were celebrated at the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=766s">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of the harvest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=767s">00:12:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you know, again, if you study 23, you'll know that Passover is mentioned in verse 4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=773s">00:12:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just in passing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=774s">00:12:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing is mentioned about it other than you need to celebrate Passover, and then he goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=777s">00:12:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right into the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</span></div><div class="c"><span

was celebrated back to back, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=815s">00:13:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it happened simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=817s">00:13:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the reason why oftentimes when they say

the Feast of Trumpets, Day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=850s">00:14:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of Atonement, Feast of Booths, and all of that pointed to the end of the harvest, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=856s">00:14:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=877s">00:14:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So in James 117, it says, "Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above.</span></div><div

applies to all mankind, whether they acknowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/292756332#t=1061s">00:17:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">him or not,
