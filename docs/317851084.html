Starting from verse 4, again reading out of the NASB. "Having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=39s">00:00:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">become as much better than the angels as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.

And when he again brings the firstborn into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=54s">00:00:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">world, he says, 'And let all the angels of God worship him.'

They will perish but you remain. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=85s">00:01:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will be... and they all will become old like a garment.

Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that you would bless this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=113s">00:01:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">time. That you would open our ears, often our hearts. Help us to be obedient to all that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=119s">00:01:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have to teach. That we would not simply be mere hearers, but to be doers of your word. We pray</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=125s">00:02:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that you would be blessed as we are blessed to be in your presence. In Jesus name we pray, amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=130s">00:02:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question and I don't want anybody to answer. Just kind of think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=136s">00:02:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, which is a more important question? Who is Jesus or who is Jesus to you? Again, don't, don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=145s">00:02:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. I just want you to think about it. Which is a more important question? Who is Jesus or who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=151s">00:02:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is Jesus to you? The answer to that question is simple. It's yes. It's both. It's not one or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=162s">00:02:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">other. So if you're not careful, you can be a part of a camp where who Jesus is, in object of truth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=170s">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't, doesn't really matter because it only matters what he means to me. So whether he is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=175s">00:02:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Son of God or whether he's the Messiah, it doesn't matter because this is what he means to me. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=181s">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously that is completely false. You can't create a God that of your desire and then say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=187s">00:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well you know that's what he means to me so it doesn't matter. That's good for you, it's good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=190s">00:03:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for me. It has nothing to do with objective truth. Obviously if you're a member in this church, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=197s">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">don't emphasize that and it is absolutely essential that you know who he is objectively. What is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=203s">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">truth about who Jesus is? But for whatever the reason, if you belong to a church where the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=210s">00:03:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is being taught, there has, there's a tendency for us to gravitate toward truth and begin to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=217s">00:03:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ignore the subjective truth of what does that mean to you. So we know who Jesus is. He's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=224s">00:03:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">second person of the Trinity. We know that he's the Messiah. We know he's the Savior. We know he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=230s">00:03:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is God. But what does that mean to you? The purpose of the book of Hebrews is not to simply get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=238s">00:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Christology correct. It's not simply so that at the end of the study of the book of Hebrews and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=243s">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">say, you know what, you know I spent so much time in understanding who Jesus is and how he fulfilled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=248s">00:04:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all the things that God was doing in the Old Testament and I can answer these questions. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=252s">00:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">goal of the book of Hebrews is not simply get the Christology right. He says again in chapter 2 verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=259s">00:04:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">1, as he concludes this section, he says, for this reason, because Jesus is greater than the prophets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=266s">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and greater than the angels, for this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=272s">00:04:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">heard so that we do not drift away from it. When he says drifting away from it, he's not simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=277s">00:04:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about theology. That at one point you believe that he was God and then you kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=281s">00:04:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">drifted and you started saying that he's not God. He's saying because you believe that he is God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=288s">00:04:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what does that mean? What does that look like in your life? The goal of our study is not simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=296s">00:04:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Christology. It's by understanding his true identity. Again, this is, I would say, Hebrews chapter 1 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=304s">00:05:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">2 in particular, I've probably spent more time in these two texts in evangelism, talking to Jehovah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=309s">00:05:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Witnesses and about the Trinity than any other text. Because to me, and people may disagree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=316s">00:05:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with me, and some people may have different opinion, it is the clearest text that teaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=321s">00:05:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about the Trinity, about who Jesus is in his identity, in his relationship with the Father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=326s">00:05:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and to the rest of creation. And so oftentimes I find myself, if I'm talking to Jehovah Witnesses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=333s">00:05:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the text I end up going to. And you'll see that if you, especially with the Jehovah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=338s">00:05:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Witnesses, because we have a very different view of who Jesus is, even though the language sounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=342s">00:05:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the same, that this is the text I usually come to. And you'll find out that their translation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=348s">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">deliberately mistranslated because they can't interpret and understand what he is saying here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=354s">00:05:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've had many discussions with Jehovah Witnesses in this text. And so I hope that through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=361s">00:06:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this study that you'll get a firmer grasp of who Jesus is. But again, the ultimate goal of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=367s">00:06:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">study is not so that at the end of it say, "Oh, I can now have a discussion with the Jehovah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=371s">00:06:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Witnesses and I can refute false doctrines." Because that is not the goal of the writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=377s">00:06:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal of the writer is if you know that, if you believe that, and if you can confess that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=383s">00:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can argue that, then what does that mean to you? Who does Jesus mean to you? Last week we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=392s">00:06:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about how Jesus is greater than the prophets and all of that was a setup to pay attention. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=396s">00:06:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so now he begins this week in this text to talk about how Jesus is greater than the angels. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=403s">00:06:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've already stated that the angels were believed to be the greatest or the highest created beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=408s">00:06:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was God and then the angels. In fact, in Hebrews chapter 2, 9, talking about Jesus's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=416s">00:06:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">incarnation, he says, "For a little while Jesus was made a little lower than the angels." So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=423s">00:07:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly states that even though man was the center of creation in Genesis chapter 1, 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=428s">00:07:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it says that in God's total plan of creation that we were actually made a little bit lower. So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=436s">00:07:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">were higher than us. When we typically think of angels, you know, we have exaggerated versions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=444s">00:07:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of good angels and bad angels, right? And a lot of it, if not most of what I hear about angels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=450s">00:07:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">usually come from television or movies. And that's why, you know, again, this is my personal thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=455s">00:07:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that horror movies are horrible because it gives you bad theology. It gives you really horrible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=462s">00:07:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">theology. Because the horror movies, usually the superpower in horror movies is usually Satan. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=468s">00:07:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody can do anything. And that's why it's so scary because there's nothing that they can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=473s">00:07:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And like it or not, even though, no matter how strong you think you are mentally, if you sit in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=479s">00:07:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">front of that and you're entertained by that, it's gonna affect your theology in your head,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=483s">00:08:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at least emotionally. Again, so that's my opinion. That's not a fact, but you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=488s">00:08:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like I would encourage you to stay away from it if you can, okay? And I know you can. All right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=494s">00:08:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of what we think about angels are usually exaggerated. So you typically, you know, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=502s">00:08:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">angels, the good angels are the white angels with wings, right? And they can fly and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=508s">00:08:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">benevolent. They're always caring, looking out for you. And that's the angels. And then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=512s">00:08:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the bad angels who are demonic and they're usually in dark colors. They have horns, right? And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=517s">00:08:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bad and they're ugly, right? They're either in red, some cape, and so they're ugly. According</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=522s">00:08:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to scripture, in their nature, it's the same. So if you were to take a bunch of people who committed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=528s">00:08:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">crime and maybe straight-A students and you put them in the same line, you're not gonna simply say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=533s">00:08:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"Criminal, not criminal. Criminal, not criminal." Because the only distinction may be their moral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=539s">00:08:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">nature. And that's exactly how the Bible describes angels. They, on the surface, probably look exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=545s">00:09:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. And the reason why demonic angels have so much power to lure people into the world is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=555s">00:09:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're just as attractive. In fact, the greatest and the highest, most attractive angel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=559s">00:09:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is Lucifer. So he doesn't scare us into chasing after the world. He lures us, much like Babylon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=569s">00:09:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he's referring to here is not the demons. What he's referring here are the angels who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=577s">00:09:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">still in service. In fact, just to understand the context before we even get into what Paul says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=582s">00:09:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to know what they understood, what the Jewish community understood about the angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=587s">00:09:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They were considered holy, powerful, above human beings. The Bible describes the numbers of angels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=598s">00:09:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as myriads of myriads. Now, the term "myriads of myriads" literally just means tens of thousands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=604s">00:10:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, tens of thousands doesn't sound like a lot, right? I remember when we were younger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=609s">00:10:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when somebody said, "Oh, he's a millionaire." And that meant a lot. It's like, "Oh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=615s">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time I'm 30, I'm gonna be a millionaire." Now, if somebody says, "I'm a millionaire," it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=619s">00:10:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "What? That's your goal?" Now people say "billionaire" because the devaluing of money and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=626s">00:10:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have to make a lot more. So tens of thousands, the way they use it, literally means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=631s">00:10:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tens of thousands, but the way the Bible uses it as numbers that you can't count. Like today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=637s">00:10:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to have a high number, you don't just say "million," you say "billions" or "gazillion"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=641s">00:10:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or "google." Or if you want to go even beyond that, you say "infinity times infinity." Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=646s">00:10:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what that means is you can't count. And so when the Bible says that there are myriads upon myriads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=653s">00:10:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of angels, they're numberless. That's how many there are. So nobody knows exactly how many angels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=659s">00:10:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">were created, but they were created in large numbers to the point where we couldn't count.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=665s">00:11:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible says that the angels actually have their own language. In Corinthians, it says it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=671s">00:11:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking of tongues of men and of angels. So they're a community. They're not just random</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=678s">00:11:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">beings just roaming around. The Bible also says that they have emotion. And so scripture describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=687s">00:11:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that when a sinner repents, he says all the angels in heaven rejoices. They are highly organized. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=695s">00:11:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible says that there's Archangel Michael, Gabriel, and Lucifer was the highest of the angels before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=701s">00:11:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">he fell. So it sounds like the way that the angels are described, like a military. So you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=707s">00:11:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">commanding officers, you have the archangel, and you have various angels who are subordinate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=711s">00:11:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">following, and so the community of angels is highly organized. In fact, the Jewish community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=718s">00:11:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">had such high regard for the angels. Paul says in Colossians 2 18 to watch out for people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=725s">00:12:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lead you into worship of angels. Colossians 2 18, "Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=731s">00:12:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">delighting in self-abasement and the worship of angels." To say that Jesus is superior to angels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=738s">00:12:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically saying Jesus is God, because there was nothing between the angels and God. And so again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=747s">00:12:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the things that I'm gonna say this morning is gonna sound a bit technical, but this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=752s">00:12:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">technicality is very important in understanding Jesus's identity. So again, I say this every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=759s">00:12:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">once in a while because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose some of you. Okay, so I'm trying to gain some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=763s">00:12:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you to pay a little bit more attention than normal. Okay, he begins by saying, verse 4, "Having become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=772s">00:12:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as much better than the angels, he has inherited a more excellent name, for to which of the sons you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=779s">00:12:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are my son, today I have begotten you." So when he says he became and he has begotten, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=787s">00:13:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that someone would ask was, Jesus is clearly a created being. That's what he says. He was begotten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=794s">00:13:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">He became. The typical word for making something out of nothing is the word in Greek, "poieo." So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=805s">00:13:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what the author meant, it would have been much more clear for him to use the word "poieos,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=810s">00:13:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to make something out of nothing. But the word he uses here is not "poieo," but "ginomai." And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=817s">00:13:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">word "ginomai" basically means that to be transformed from one to another. It's not creation from nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=824s">00:13:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to something. The theologians call that "ex nihilo," something out of nothing, and only God has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=829s">00:13:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to do that. He's not saying that Jesus was nothing and then he became something, but he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=834s">00:13:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">being transformed from one form to another. In 1st Corinthians 4 15, that same word is used this way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=840s">00:14:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers. For in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=846s">00:14:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel." So here he's not saying that the Corinthians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=853s">00:14:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't exist and all of a sudden they came into existence because of Paul. He's saying that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=858s">00:14:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">weren't Christians, they became Christians. Again, Philemon verse 10, "I appeal to you for my child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=864s">00:14:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment." He's not saying that he didn't exist and then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=871s">00:14:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">gave birth and all of a sudden he came to being. Obviously he's saying that he's using the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=876s">00:14:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"begotten" in the same way, that he transformed from one to another. Now I think the best illustration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=883s">00:14:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of that is found in Philippians chapter 2 6 through 11, where Jesus humbles himself and then he is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=889s">00:14:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">exalted and then he he receives a name that is greater than any other. So Philippians 2 6 through 11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=894s">00:14:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">"Who although he existed in form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=901s">00:15:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but he emptied himself." So let me stop right there. So God, Jesus didn't all of a sudden appear out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=908s">00:15:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">nowhere in his humanity. He said he was God and he was pre-existent. But what he emptied himself was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=915s">00:15:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the glory. He said he emptied himself of his glory, he took on a form of a servant, being made in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=921s">00:15:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">likeness of men, being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself becoming obedient to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=926s">00:15:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">point of death and even death on a cross. And for this reason, because he emptied himself, became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=931s">00:15:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing, for this reason God highly exalted him, bestowed on him the name which is above every name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=937s">00:15:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=942s">00:15:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we clearly see here that Christ wasn't created. He was God. He veiled his glory in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=952s">00:15:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">humanity and he humbled himself. And this humility is permanent. His union, his 100% God, 100% man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=962s">00:16:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is a permanent union where he veils his glory and as a result of what he has done, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=968s">00:16:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">God the Father exalts him and causes him to be exalted in his name to be honored. Now all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=977s">00:16:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that may or may not be going over your head, but it is a clear teaching of Jesus's deity. It's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=984s">00:16:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">clear teaching that he is equal with God and yet he is also distinct. And I'm going to continue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=989s">00:16:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">go forward. So he begins by declaring that and then he goes even further than that and he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=995s">00:16:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus inherited a better name than the angels. Now I've already shared that the angels were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1002s">00:16:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">considered the highest of beings and they were considered so highly that many of them were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1009s">00:16:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tempted to worship the angels. In fact, oftentimes you'll see, and I'll mention this later, where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1015s">00:16:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have encounters with the saints of the Old Testament and New Testament and their immediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1019s">00:16:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">reaction is to bow down and worship. And then angels stop them. And I'll mention a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1024s">00:17:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more later. That's how they regarded the angels. But here the author says he inherited a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1032s">00:17:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">name. He was made a little bit lower in his humanity, but as a result he is exalted. He was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1038s">00:17:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">placed higher than the angels, better than the angels. Now again, in our culture when we say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1044s">00:17:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your name is better than his name, we just mean it sounds better, right? You meet a guy named Dorcas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1051s">00:17:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

Centurion, Roman, right? So today when we say, you know, Roman, you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1067s">00:17:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">better name than Dorcas.

In context, in culture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1073s">00:17:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to understand what they mean by better name.

We see that with Abram,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1100s">00:18:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which means exalted father.

Isaac, his name literally means laughter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1154s">00:19:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and they named him laughter for two reasons. One, because God said you're gonna have a child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1159s">00:19:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and they said at this age?

But also they named him laughter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1165s">00:19:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because from that unbelief God was gracious and they gave him Isaac and they rejoice. And so he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1172s">00:19:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was named laughter.

Jacob, his name literally means grasper of heel. Can you imagine that? He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1186s">00:19:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">came out and grasper of heels is like, oh Jacob, right?

Later on as he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1197s">00:19:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">matures and his faith begins to grow and God blesses his life, he wrestles with God.

That's how high he is exalted. Ephesians 1 21, far above all rule and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1322s">00:22:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">authority and power and dominion.

And he went out of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1750s">00:29:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">way to come track me down and he said, "I can't believe you guys are still doing this." And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1754s">00:29:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he just started going off. And so I was standing there and I had about four or five other students</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1759s">00:29:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with me. And he just kind of tore into me. The Bible never says that Jesus never claimed to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1765s">00:29:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">God. You guys, you know, first century started saying this and now you're repeating this lie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1770s">00:29:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at the Bible. And then he started quoting scripture. He started quoting the creek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1774s">00:29:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm getting rocked." Right? And one of the students that was with me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1781s">00:29:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's exactly what he said. After that professor was done, he walked away and he said, "Dude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1784s">00:29:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you got rocked." You know, so I said, "You know, I better find out." So I went back to my professor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1791s">00:29:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and I basically jotted down all these questions that came up and I asked him. They were very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1795s">00:29:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">simple answers to all of it.

And I think one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1813s">00:30:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">clearest passages what Jesus says of himself is found in this passage, in my opinion. John chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1818s">00:30:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">5, 22 to 23. Listen to what he says. This is a small portion of a larger context of Jesus declaring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1826s">00:30:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to be God himself. Verse 22, "For not even the Father judges anyone, but he has given all judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1835s">00:30:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Son." Let me stop right there. Did you just hear what he said? He didn't simply say, "Me and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1843s">00:30:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">God are equal." He didn't simply just say that. I mean, he says that in all these other places. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1846s">00:30:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Even the Father does not judge, but I do." Think about that. To even say that you're near God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1858s">00:30:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they would have stoned you for that. To enter into the Holy of Holies and you're not a high priest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1865s">00:31:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they would have stoned you for that. How dare you show that kind of irreverence for God? Jesus said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1871s">00:31:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">out of his own mouth, "Even the Father does not judge, but I do." I mean, you can't go beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1880s">00:31:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus did not simply say he was a God, or he's below God, he's a son of God. He says he does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1888s">00:31:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things that even the Father does not do. He is co-equal with God. He is the second person of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1896s">00:31:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Trinity. And then he explains, "So that all will honor the Son, even as they honor the Father."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1906s">00:31:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The angels were trembling because John bowed down to worship. They said, "Stop that. Don't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1913s">00:31:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't get me in trouble. I'm just like you." But Jesus says, "I do what even the Father does not do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1922s">00:32:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to be what?

It's another way of saying to be worshiped like the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1928s">00:32:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How can anybody read that and say Jesus did not say that he's God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=1933s">00:32:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus is clearly declaring his deity.

So we use that word in our churches to say, "Throwing out trash can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2197s">00:36:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">could be an act of worship to God." Babysitting, teaching, giving, all of that we do for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2203s">00:36:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of building up his kingdom is an act of worship. It's not investing. It's worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2210s">00:36:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the word "le truo." The second word is "sabomai." It means to have reverence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2216s">00:36:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know that you can sit here with no reverence. You can regurgitate words and go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2221s">00:37:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">through the action, but there's no sense of reverence toward God. But the second word for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2225s">00:37:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">worship is internal, something going on internally, reverence. But the most prominent word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2232s">00:37:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">majority of the words in the New Testament that is translated for worship is "proskuneo."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2238s">00:37:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the word "proskuneo" literally means to fall down and worship. Literally, it means to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2246s">00:37:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">toward to kiss somebody's feet. The word "feet" is not there, but that's just assumed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2251s">00:37:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to bow down, go toward to kiss. In other words, you are so enamored, you are so awed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2259s">00:37:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that it causes you to be prostrated. And so in our generation, when we think of worship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2268s">00:37:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we think of Sunday morning, we think of service, maybe even a reverence in our heart and spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2272s">00:37:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and in truth. But the idea of being prostrated before the Almighty God has been lost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317851084#t=2280s">00:38:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or we're beginning to lose it.
