Well today's passage that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=482s">00:08:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at, verse 26-27, he says, "The Holy Spirit now, He empowers us to pray effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=488s">00:08:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that God would hear us." I think you will agree with me, at least to the extent that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=495s">00:08:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's either the most important or one of the most important gifts that we've been given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=500s">00:08:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as a child of God is that we are able to pray to Him, that we have access to Him. That we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=505s">00:08:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">not just legally His children. It's like we went through the adoption papers and stamped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=510s">00:08:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the name, but we're still living in the orphanage and the one who adopted us is living somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=514s">00:08:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">else. You know, a lot of Christians live like we're just legally His children, but in all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=521s">00:08:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">practical purposes there's no relationship.

So it wasn't just simply legally that we became His children, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=531s">00:08:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">benefit that we have as children of God, that we have access to Him, that we are able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=536s">00:08:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">pray to Him, and He hears us as His children. Not just some creation, but as His children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=544s">00:09:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so over and over again He says, "If we pray, He hears us." And we are encouraged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=549s">00:09:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and challenged and commanded even to come to Him in prayer. So if prayer is a distinction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=556s">00:09:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">between a Christian and a non-Christian, because we have access to this Father, the next question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=563s">00:09:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to ask ourself, "Then how is your prayer life?" Now I don't have to survey the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=569s">00:09:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">church because I've surveyed many, many times. If you ask most people which spiritual discipline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=575s">00:09:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they struggle with most, you put it between 1, 2, 3, 4, usually people say, "I'm good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=582s">00:09:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">with fellowship." Because I went to Disneyland and we spent 24 hours together yesterday and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=588s">00:09:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we were all Christians, so we had fellowship. We're good. We went and grabbed boba every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=593s">00:09:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">other day, so we're good. Probably not real fellowship, that's not what fellowship means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=600s">00:10:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">partnership in doing something. But typically if you ask an average person what they feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=606s">00:10:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like they're good in, it's like, "Well I'm good with fellowship." And then the second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=609s">00:10:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you attend a Bible teaching church like ours, "I'm good with Word." Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=614s">00:10:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the Word of God is being taught on Sunday, and Bible study, especially in our generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=618s">00:10:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just turn on the radio and the Word of God is taught. And so typically it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=623s">00:10:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">go fellowship, the Word, and then 3 and 4 usually is different based upon what kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=630s">00:10:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of personality you have. So if you happen to be an outgoing person who likes to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=634s">00:10:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to strangers, you say, "Well evangelism is number 3 because I talk to people." That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=639s">00:10:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">evangelism. And then the fourth would be prayer. So if you happen to be an introvert, you may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=643s">00:10:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">be 3, you know, prayer would be 3, evangelism 4. But whatever it is, it's usually prayer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=649s">00:10:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is in the bottom half, either 3 or 4. Well if prayer is the most powerful, most significant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=656s">00:10:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that we have gained, to have access to the Father and pray, and yet we find ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=667s">00:11:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling in our prayer, in our disciplines, wouldn't that leave us in despair, frustration,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=674s">00:11:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe even desire to quit? And many people actually end up doing that because, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=683s">00:11:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I have such a hard time praying. In fact, even when I begin to pray, all I can think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=687s">00:11:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">about is fantasy football or basketball or all these different things that I've watched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=692s">00:11:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">are playing through my head and all the deadlines and everything that I'm responsible for and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=697s">00:11:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I have such a hard time praying." And then eventually after a while you just stop praying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=703s">00:11:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It almost seems like God knew that you and I were going to struggle. If God left us and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=710s">00:11:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Well, you know, all these other things don't matter, but if you just become a powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=715s">00:11:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">prayer warrior, then at least that will save you." But that's not what the scripture says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=723s">00:12:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, Hebrews 7.25 says, "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=728s">00:12:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for us."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=735s">00:12:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ intercedes on our behalf.

And some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=818s">00:13:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of you, again, may have been in a situation where your prayer was just sighing and groaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=825s">00:13:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The word that is translated says it was without words.

His passion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=953s">00:15:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for lost sinners like you and me was so passionate, was so jealous, that He would even offer up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=959s">00:15:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">His only begotten Son to pursue us.

But He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1593s">00:26:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that even because we do not know, He says, "For we do not know what to pray for as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1597s">00:26:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us."

The whole book of Job is a description of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1610s">00:26:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">righteous man who couldn't understand why is God doing this?

There's a lot of things that happen in our life that we don't fully get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1670s">00:27:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that we don't understand.

But the hope that we have is that the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1683s">00:28:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">who is sighing and groaning on our behalf, He knows.

Thirdly, the reason why the Holy Spirit intercedes is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1720s">00:28:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">He's the best person to intercede for us. He says, "The Father knows the mind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1725s">00:28:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit and the Spirit knows the will of God." John chapter 15 verse 7, it says, "If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1733s">00:28:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">abide in my word, my word abides in you.

In fact, one of the most common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1743s">00:29:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that I get as a pastor is, "What is His will?" So how can we pray according</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1749s">00:29:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to His will when at times we're just lost? If you want to know what I like to eat, ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1758s">00:29:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Esther. Esther knows me better than anybody else, at least now as an adult. I spend the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1764s">00:29:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">most time with her. So if you want to know where I am Wednesday at 3 o'clock, she's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1769s">00:29:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the best person to ask. She's my best ambassador. You know, it wasn't always like that. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1775s">00:29:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we first got married, a lot of the marriage problems comes because we don't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1779s">00:29:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">each other. I would come home and her sadness, annoyance, tired, angry, all looked the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1787s">00:29:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to me. And you can imagine what kind of trouble you're going to get into. You walk home, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1793s">00:29:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Why are you angry?" She might have just been tired. And she's like, "I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1799s">00:29:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">tired." "Why are you treating me like this?" And then it would turn into, "She's angry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1804s">00:30:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because I got angry and then I'm angry because now she's really angry." And then that starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1807s">00:30:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to fight, right? So it wasn't about anything other than I misread her. The good thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1813s">00:30:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">being married for a long time is that communication is a lot easier. And sometimes we laugh about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1820s">00:30:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it because I spend the most time with Esther. And so after almost 25 years, I can fidget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1828s">00:30:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain way and she knows, "Oh, you're thirsty." We'd be driving in the car and even before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1838s">00:30:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm about to fall asleep, she'll say, "You're tired. Pull over." Like, "Wow, I didn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1845s">00:30:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">swerve." I remember one time I was driving and I don't know, I was thinking about something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1852s">00:30:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that was making me mad. And I was just driving by myself and I'm just, I mean, with her in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1861s">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the car and then she looked over and she's like, "What's wrong with you?" I said, "I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1868s">00:31:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not mad." I said, "What do you mean?" She's like, "You look like you're going to kill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1870s">00:31:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody." I said, "She read my thoughts." And that's the benefit of being married for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1877s">00:31:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a long time. Like the communication becomes a lot easier. I walk in, I can tell the distinction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1884s">00:31:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no better person to represent us before God than the Holy Spirit. Not only does He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1891s">00:31:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sigh on our behalf, if He doesn't know who we are and if He doesn't know who the Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1896s">00:31:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is, His prayer would be like ours. It would just kind of miss. He's saying things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1901s">00:31:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">really doesn't matter. It's not according to His will. But nobody knows the mind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1905s">00:31:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Spirit better than the Father. And nobody knows the will of God than the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1912s">00:31:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that Holy Spirit that is indwelling in us is sighing passionately and groaning on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1919s">00:31:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our behalf constantly. That's where our eternal security comes from. Not you, not me. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1926s">00:32:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">even in our weakness, He knew our weakness. He gave us His Son. That's why our prayers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1937s">00:32:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in accordance to the Spirit is effective. In the Old Testament, you had Moses who represented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1947s">00:32:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the nation of Israel and God to the nation of Israel. But at the end of his life, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1952s">00:32:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he didn't represent God as holy, because he was a human being. And he was disqualified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1959s">00:32:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into entering the Promised Land. Every single prophet that spoke on behalf of God was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1965s">00:32:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">human being. Also under the bondage of sin. And even the high priest, he could only enter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1972s">00:32:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Holy of Holies once a year because he himself was sinful. Only the Holy Spirit can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1979s">00:32:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be in the presence of the Father and know His will perfectly and His will known perfectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1986s">00:33:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is why He doesn't need to speak. His prayers are groaning and sighing without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=1992s">00:33:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">words because God knows Him. And that Holy Spirit is indwelling in us. And God answers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2002s">00:33:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that prayer. God answers that prayer. So next question we have to ask is the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2009s">00:33:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is interceding for us. And that's where our confidence assurance comes from. What is He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2014s">00:33:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sighing for? What is He groaning about on our behalf? Well, it's stated in John chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2021s">00:33:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">17. So turn your Bibles with me to John chapter 17. I'm not going to read the whole text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2026s">00:33:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but John chapter 17 is called the priestly prayer, high priestly prayer. Jesus is praying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2032s">00:33:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and He's praying deliberately and publicly so that people can hear. So that we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2037s">00:33:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">understand that as Jesus intercedes on our behalf this is what He is praying. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2041s">00:34:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">not going to read all of it, but the first section of it He basically says, "Now is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2045s">00:34:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">time for Me to glorify you and for you to glorify the Son." And He's talking about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2048s">00:34:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">cross. So the first part of the prayer is between Him and the Father and how His whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2054s">00:34:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry was to glorify Him and how He's come to save mankind to honor and glorify the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2060s">00:34:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But the section that I want to read to you starting from verse 13 where His prayers turn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2064s">00:34:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">directly to us. And this gives us a glimpse of what the Holy Spirit is groaning and sighing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2070s">00:34:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for and this is what He says in verse 13. John chapter 17, 13. "But now I am coming to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2077s">00:34:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you and these things I speak in the world that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2082s">00:34:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me stop right there.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2100s">00:35:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">when He says to make My joy fulfilled in them, He's talking about to give them life and give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2104s">00:35:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this life abundantly. So first and foremost He's praying for our life, verse 14. "I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2110s">00:35:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">given them Your Word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2115s">00:35:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">as I am not of the world." So stop right there. He recognizes that because they become followers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2121s">00:35:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ that persecution and hardship is going to come into their life. That difficulty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2126s">00:35:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to come because they're living in this world, but they're not of this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2131s">00:35:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But look at verse 15. He doesn't pray for deliverance, verse 15. "I do not ask that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2135s">00:35:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one." So He prays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2141s">00:35:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for life and He prays and recognizes that suffering is going to come as a result of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2146s">00:35:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">being a Christian. Not despite, but because you're a Christian. You no longer belong to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2152s">00:35:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this world. The things that this world runs to for comfort, it is no longer yours. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2158s">00:35:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">as a result of that, there's going to be trials and difficulty and suffering. He recognizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2163s">00:36:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that, but He doesn't pray that they would be taken out of the world. In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2167s">00:36:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not praying that that suffering would stop. That's what He means that He's not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2172s">00:36:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not praying that they would be out of this world. He says, "I ask that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2177s">00:36:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">protect them from the evil one." In other words, that they would persevere. When the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2183s">00:36:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">attack comes, when the suffering comes, that you give them enough strength to persevere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2188s">00:36:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">through these trials. And then verse 16, "that they are not of the world just as I am not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2192s">00:36:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of the world. Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." So let's recap what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2200s">00:36:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He is saying. What is the Holy Spirit sighing and groaning intensely on our behalf? Who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2206s">00:36:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">knows the will of God perfectly and is praying perfectly according to His will. What is He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2213s">00:36:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">praying for? Our salvation, joy. He's praying that suffering that will come because we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2220s">00:37:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians, that He doesn't pray for us to be delivered from that, but to persevere in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2225s">00:37:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it so that our faith will not fail, to protect us from the evil one. And then third, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2231s">00:37:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we will be sanctified in the process. He's praying for our salvation and our own sanctification</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2239s">00:37:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">above your safety, above your comfort. That's what the Holy Spirit is groaning on our behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2247s">00:37:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If you pray and your prayer is contradicting the Holy Spirit's groaning in you, guess which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2254s">00:37:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">prayer is going to be answered? Beans and rice in Jesus Christ or the groaning of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2263s">00:37:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit? Groaning of the Holy Spirit is being answered by our Father. The sighing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2271s">00:37:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Holy Spirit, wanting us to be saved, wanting us to persevere through hardship because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2278s">00:37:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">we're Christians and to sanctify us. That pressure that you feel in your life, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2287s">00:38:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying so hard to escape from, may have been an answer to the prayers of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2293s">00:38:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit in you. Because God desires sanctification in your life more than anything else because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2301s">00:38:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it is in sanctification that you are connected to the author of this life. But his prayer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2308s">00:38:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't stop there. His prayer goes on, verse 18, "As you sent me into the world, so I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2313s">00:38:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">sent them into the world. And for their sake, I consecrate myself that they also may be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2318s">00:38:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctified in truth." And then he says in verse 20, "I do not ask for these only, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2323s">00:38:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2329s">00:38:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">finally, not only our salvation, not only our perseverance and sanctification, but that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2335s">00:38:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">God would use us to continue to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. That is what is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2342s">00:39:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">prayed on our behalf, morning, day, and night. And it is in answer to that prayer that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2351s">00:39:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is acting in your life. And he says, "If you pray, if you abide in me, my words abide in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2361s">00:39:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you." You know, when my oldest son, Jeremy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2370s">00:39:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">when he was younger, he was in high school, you know, Esther and I, there was a period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2374s">00:39:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">when we would go out on campus together to share the gospel. Well, Jeremy would have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2380s">00:39:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, certain periods of the day he was off, and he'd say, "Hey, what are you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2382s">00:39:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">doing?" I'd say, "Oh, we're going to go, you know, go on campus and share the gospel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2386s">00:39:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jeremy said, "Can I come?" So I said, "Why?" You know, he's never asked us this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2393s">00:39:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">before. He said, "Can I come?" I said, "Well, you know, we're going to share the gospel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2395s">00:39:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Yeah, I want to join you." So Esther and I were like, "Is this our son?" And obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2404s">00:40:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we were elated. You know, this is the reason why Esther and I got married. We're in ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2409s">00:40:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we're doing this together. And so our son, when he wanted to come and he joined Esther</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2414s">00:40:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to go on campus to share the gospel, I mean, to this day, and that's why I'm using it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2419s">00:40:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">an illustration because he was, I mean, it just made us so happy that he wanted to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2424s">00:40:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">this with us. Now, he didn't know it at that time, but he could have literally asked for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2429s">00:40:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">anything at that time, and I would have given it to him. If he said, "Dad, I need new shoes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2437s">00:40:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because I need to go on campus. My shoes are dirty, you know, and I want to represent Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2444s">00:40:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in clean shoes." I would have said, "Yes, my son, you need clean shoes." Right? "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2452s">00:40:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the car, I don't know if it's going to make it. You know, I need a car that's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2457s">00:40:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">take me there so I don't, the car doesn't, the engine doesn't shut down halfway there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2461s">00:41:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I need to make sure that I get there on time to share the gospel." I'd say, "Yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2465s">00:41:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which car do you need, son? Make sure that you get there." Right? He could have asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2471s">00:41:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">anything at that moment. He didn't know it, and that time has passed now. But he tapped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2484s">00:41:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">into the core of what makes Esther and myself happy. But once he tapped into that, he could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2492s">00:41:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">have asked anything. See, when the Scripture says, "If you abide in me, my words abide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2498s">00:41:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in you," our Father is eager to answer our prayers. But He wants to answer our prayers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2505s">00:41:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to what is best for you, and that's the Holy Spirit that He's entrusted and is groaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2510s">00:41:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">on our behalf. Now, you can hear all of this, "Oh, thank God we have the Holy Spirit. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2515s">00:41:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't need to pray, because since we have an advocate praying on our behalf, perfectly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2519s">00:41:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">know the mind of God." Right? You may think that, but I believe a genuine response to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2526s">00:42:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this is to live up to the calling that you have received. See, if God left it up to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2534s">00:42:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you would be defeated, anxious, maybe even wanting to quit. The reason why we can persevere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2543s">00:42:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in our prayers, the reason why we can persevere in our walk with God, that despite our weakness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2549s">00:42:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">God understands who we are.

I made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2563s">00:42:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you my children, now live up to it.

So imagine what our life would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2591s">00:43:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">be like if we actually joined the Holy Spirit in that prayer. How pleased our Father would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2598s">00:43:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">be. How honored and glorified our Father would be if we joined the Holy Spirit to pray for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2605s">00:43:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that He is already sighing and groaning for. As we remember and celebrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2612s">00:43:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the coming of Christ, and I know there's a lot of busyness and exchanging gifts and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2618s">00:43:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of that stuff is great, you know, but let's take some time to remember what it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2625s">00:43:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we have in Christ.

Let's take some time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/195376438#t=2636s">00:43:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to pray as our worship team comes up.
