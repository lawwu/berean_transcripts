Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. for sinners to be reconciled to God from the beginning. So God didn't say, hey, in order for you to come to me, these are the things that you need to go through. And that's why we think that when Cain and Abel was giving sacrifice, again, it doesn't say it there, but it seems like they already understood what was acceptable was not acceptable.</p><p>And so what Cain was doing wasn't simply by convenience. It was disobedience, right? And that's why later on Cain is called evil for what he did, okay? So we see that from the get-go, God, even though judgment came into mankind, immediately God provided a way to reconcile them to God.</p><p>Does that make sense? It wasn't like a long period of time went by where they had no way to get to God. It was from the very beginning, he provided a way where sacrifices were made so that the atonement could have happened, again, foreshadowing what was about to come, okay?</p><p>And then in seven, two to three, God required, if you remember, he said to the clean animals were to be given in seven. So in Hebrew, it literally says seven, seven, which means a pair of seven, right? So all the clean animals were seven pairs, and all the unclean animals were one pair.</p><p>Now, why was that? Okay? Now, clearly it tells us, some people will say it's for food. Obviously, it was for food. Later on, God tells us, tells them that they can eat these animals. But prior to that, in 820, it spells out that as soon as Noah comes out of the ark, the first thing that they do is they give burnt offering, right?</p><p>Again, burnt offering is mentioned in Leviticus chapter one. And yet, it says here that he gave burnt offering. So Noah somehow knew that already. And so in order to give burnt offering, only clean animals were able to be given as burnt offering, right? So God was providing for them, even as they're entering into the ark, a way for them to worship him, right?</p><p>And to be atoned, their sins to be atoned for through these animals, even as he is preserving these animals. Does that make sense? Okay? So this is not something that happened gradually from right off the bat, God provided a way for them to get to him, right? Even the animals that he preserved, you can see that in the details, okay?</p><p>So how many years went by from the time when God told Noah? Now, some will say 120, simply because in the previous chapters, it says that the number of years will be 120 years. But if you calculate, Noah, when he had children, and when the flood comes, he had children when he had, it says in Genesis 5, that he was 500 years old, okay?</p><p>And then the flood comes when he is 600 years old. So somewhere between those years, right? So it only tells us that when he was 500, he had these three children. So it could be anywhere from 80 to 100 years, right? Probably not 100. Maybe 97, right? Because he needs nine months in between, right?</p><p>And so somewhere around there. So let's say 80, between 80 and 100, so 90 years. Now, why is this significant? Because in 1 Peter 3.20, in those 90 years, it says, these souls at that time were disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is eight persons, were brought safely through the water, right?</p><p>And it tells us in 2 Peter that that Noah was a preacher of righteousness. So during those 80, 90 years, Noah was preaching to them. And in 1 Peter 3.20, it says, even as the plan of the flood was coming, God was giving them an opportunity to repent, right?</p><p>You see that? Right? So right off the mat, as the judgment is coming, as people are dying, as sin is increasing, God's grace is continuing to pursue the sinners, okay? And so we see that even in the details of how the ark is described, what is allowed, all of these things are God's provision for mankind to be reconciled to him, okay?</p><p>Okay. I don't know about you, but you probably noticed that detailed measurements or the timing, right? In the description of Noah's ark, there's detailed measurements, and then here, it gives detailed timing, right? Everything is so precise, right? These are some of the things that I've listed, number one through six.</p><p>You probably, there's more than this, but I just highlighted, right? It even tells us that the water lifted up how high? Do you remember? 22 cubits above the highest mountain. Even that was measured, right? So why is, was it so important to measure every single detail, right? A couple of things I noted, that God is precise with his instructions on how we will be saved and lived, and so we talked about how he built the ark.</p><p>Remember, where else are the measurements are so precise. The tabernacle and descriptions of the new heaven and new earth, right? And so we see here, when we're talking about the very specific timing, timing, right? Where else is the timing, right? Where else is the timing very precise? Look at the book of Revelation, right?</p><p>Seven days, right? Four, you know, half times half. When we describe, describe the book of Revelation, when it gets to the judgment, it's very precise with timing, right? So some may interpret that and say it's all allegorical, but if you were to take it literally, I mean, it's like there's so much, right?</p><p>So much timing and measurement that's placed in the book of Revelation. And so if you see what's happening here at the ark, the flood, you can kind of see the similarities between what he is doing, how he is describing things at the ark at the end times, right? And that's why I think a literal interpretation, as much as possible, of the book of Revelation makes more sense.</p><p>Because that's how it's fulfilled in the first time, okay? Same thing with the coming of Christ. Everything that Jesus said is first ought to be interpreted literally because that's how it was fulfilled, hanging on a cross, riding on a donkey, his servants scattering, all of these things that when it didn't happen may look like, oh, that could have been allegorical, but it actually happened literally, right?</p><p>So again, it kind of mimics what's happening with God's judgment, and then the details support the validity of the historical events of the flood, right? If you're making up something, you wouldn't go into that much detail, right? The details are there that may seem unnecessary. It's because it's true.</p><p>It's a fact, right? In fact, a good example of that is a man named Sir William Ramsey. He's an archaeologist, historian, who set out to disprove the New Testament, especially the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, because there's so many historical events and places that are mentioned only in Luke's writing.</p><p>So he set out that he's going to go and go to the details that are mentioned, that are mentioned nowhere else except for Luke's writings, and thinking that at the end of it, he's going to disprove. You see, if Luke's writings are fictional, then he can prove that what he's saying is also fictional, right?</p><p>So at the end of his pursuit, he ended up becoming a Christian. And what he says, and there's many quotes from him, he says, "I began with a mind unfavorable to it, but more and more I found myself brought into contact with the accuracy of the New Testament." And another thing, I don't have the quote here, what he says, he said that it's very difficult for him to believe that Luke went to that much trouble to describe every little intricate details of the surroundings, of the place, of the particular event, if everything else he was saying was untrue, right?</p><p>If he's making up the story of the resurrection, why would he describe everything around it to be true, right? And so at the end of that, after 30 years of digging, he ended up becoming a Christian because it doesn't make sense that so much of it would be so accurate to that detail.</p><p>It would only make sense if everything that he was saying was true, okay? There's so many evidence of the flood. Instead of me describing it to you, I thought it'd be good if we can hear this. I don't know if we can hear this. Okay, again, I don't know what I'm doing with this, but I thought it'd be better if you just heard it instead of...</p><p>There is no sound. Is there is it possible? Is it possible to have sound? The top five re... Okay, there you go. All right. Ready? The top five reasons the global flood may have actually happened. Number five, human documented history of the flood. If a global flood happened, you'd expect people around the world in ancient history to have told this story.</p><p>And they do. Basically, all the people. The Chinese, the Native Americans, the Hindi people, the Sumerians, the Greek, the Aztecs, the Norse people, the story of Atlantis, and of course, the biblical story, which is the account of the Jewish people. And their stories are largely similar. God or the gods were mad, and so they flooded the earth, while the hero of the story builds a boat and saved all the people and the animals.</p><p>Number four, geologic evidence of a catastrophic flood. There is evidence all over the world of unfathomably massive flooding. For centuries, science taught us that everything we see was the - Can you flip it to the other, and then show it to them? Because this is my whole study today.</p><p>You're going to ruin the whole Bible study if this doesn't work. There's a way to do it. Okay, give us one minute if we can't figure it out. Oh, so easy! I think you'll have to sync it up with them. Yeah. Wanna just start from the beginning? The top five reasons the global flood may have actually happened.</p><p>Number five, human documented history of the flood. If a global flood happened, you'd expect people around the world in ancient history to have told this story. And they do. Basically, all the people. The Chinese, the Native Americans, the Hindi people, the Sumerians, the Greek, the Aztecs, the Norse people, the story of Atlantis, and of course, the biblical story, which is the account of the Jewish people.</p><p>And their stories are largely similar. God or the gods were mad, and so they flooded the earth. While the hero of the story builds a boat and saved all the people and the animals. Number four, geologic evidence of a catastrophic flood. There is evidence all over the world of unfathomably massive flooding.</p><p>For centuries, science taught us that everything we see was the result of slow, steady processes over deep time. Until J. Harlan Bretz took on the scientific elites and proved the great ice dam flood of the Pacific Northwest. You can see the size of these small ripples that are the result of a local flood.</p><p>And these pictures from the Camas Prairie in Idaho, which is in the path of this Missoula flood, has the same kind of ripples, but the scale is hundreds if not thousands of times larger. Everybody knows the Niagara Falls. This is the Horseshoe Dam, compared to the Dry Falls formation in Washington, also part of this Missoula flood.</p><p>The water at the Niagara Falls rushes over the edge at 200,000 cubic feet per second. While the water at this Dry Falls formation ravaged through at 300 to 400 million cubic feet per second. Hundreds of times more water than the Niagara Falls. Imagine the scale. And now that we know that these formations were caused by catastrophic floods, science is finding evidence of these kinds of catastrophic floods all over the world, including two that are larger than the Missoula flood.</p><p>Number three, oceans underneath the Earth's crust. One of the first questions that comes to mind when thinking of a global flood is where did the water come from? Which is a good question at surface level. But if you read the biblical account of Noah's flood, it's very clear where the water came from.</p><p>Genesis 7:11, "In the 600th year of Noah's life, on the 17th day of the second month. On that day, all the springs of the great deep burst forth." Job 38:8, "Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb?" Where did the water come from?</p><p>The Bible clearly says that the floodwaters came from inside of the Earth, and scientists have potentially just recently found this water. They now estimate that there's more water underneath the Earth's crust than above. How did the author of the Bible get this right over 3,000 years ago? Good guess, Moses.</p><p>Number two, the ice age. The fact that there was even an ice age at all provides strong evidence for a global flood. Why? We all have this idea of what the ice age was. The entire Earth covered in snow. But that's not the truth. The Earth was only about four degrees colder.</p><p>However, up to 30% of the Earth was covered in ice. Glaciers, technically. Today, less than 5% of the Earth is covered in glaciers. So where did all the snow come from to cover 30% of the Earth? What do you need to form ice? Cold and water. If you only have cold, then you just have a cold age, not an ice age.</p><p>Where did the precipitation come from? At the beginning of this last winter, Buffalo, New York, experienced the most massive blizzard in its recorded history, when a lake effect storm caused 60 inches of snow to encase the city. And how did this happen? Freezing cold arctic air moved south over the warm waters of the Great Lakes.</p><p>The waters were still warm from the fall, and as the cold air passes over the warm water, it causes evaporation, precipitation. And in the Buffalo Blizzard, this created a conveyor belt of snow, as the warm waters meeting the cold air caused the formation of clouds and precipitation. And this can explain where the water for the ice age came from.</p><p>Models show that if there was a global flood, this event would have created a tremendous amount of energy or heat, largely due to friction. This heat would have dissipated into, and of course, heated up the oceans, creating this lake effect phenomenon, but on a global scale. Number one evidence that a global flood may have actually happened: the fossil record.</p><p>How is a fossil formed? When an animal dies, the scavengers almost immediately get to work on beginning the process of disassembling the formerly living thing. And this is just the beginning phase of its total decomposition, finished off by bugs, bacteria, and fungi. It's gross, but it's an amazing system for recycling organic material.</p><p>Because of the efficacy of this recycling process, dead animals stand basically no chance at being preserved in any complete or articulated way. And this is why, in order for something to become a fossil, it basically needs to be rapidly buried by mud or sand, which helps to make sense of the fossils of animals that died while eating, giving birth, and that are found in death poses, arched back before being rapidly covered by mud, sometimes sand.</p><p>So the very fact that fossils are found all over the earth is compelling evidence for a global, rapid animal-bearing event, like a flood. It also explains why marine fossils, like whales and sharks, have been found in the middle of deserts, and also on the top of Mount Everest, the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world.</p><p>So what do you think? Did a global flood actually happen? All right, I got a couple more slides before we end, okay? So this is a picture of, how many of you guys have been here in Kentucky? There's an actual replica that they made of, I think they call it the Creation Museum, right?</p><p>It's the Creation Museum, right? Anyway, this is in Kentucky, and they made the actual size of it. And I wanted to give you an idea of how big the ark is in feet, because we don't do centimeters, right? It's about 450 feet long, about 75 feet wide, and about 30 feet high, right?</p><p>So many guys who are not good with measurements, our sanctuary is about 100 feet sideways, and about 70 feet length, right? From the pulpit to the back where the AV room is, right? It's about 70 feet. And then the length, the width of it is 700 feet, about 100 feet, about 90 some feet.</p><p>And it's about 20 to 22 feet high, which means if you look at the total volume, it would be about five times the size of our sanctuary, okay? And it was built in three decks, right? And so the natural question that I had when I was younger, when I was looking through this, is that could they have actually fit all these animals?</p><p>According to, again, I'm not going to go into too much details, but according to a study, they said majority of the animals on earth, even today, are the size of a small dog or smaller, majority of them. So when we think of animals, we're thinking elephants and buffaloes and all these things, but when you actually calculate the size of the animals, majority of them are the size of a dog or smaller.</p><p>And then on top of that, if you calculate like the language of what it says, it says all of the birds of their kind, right? It doesn't necessarily mean every single species. It means of their kind, right? And so according to the volume of what the size of this boat would have carried, most people believe that it was probably even just volume-wise, it would have only taken about 25% or less, okay?</p><p>So is it possible? Yes, it's possible, right? And so I just wanted to throw that out there, because this is something that I asked when I was younger, looking at this, it's like, it's crazy to think that all the animals like fit into that boat, but considering the size of the boat, the volume of the boat, and the volume of all the animals put together, it could have easily done that, okay?</p><p>And in chapter 8, verse 1, before the flood actually comes, he said God remembered Noah. Now obviously, when he says he remembered, it doesn't mean like he told him to build the ark, and then just, oh, that's right, I forgot about Noah, right? Clearly, that's not what he means, right?</p><p>He means that the covenant that he made, that he was going to save mankind through Noah, that he keeps his promise, right? And that's the theme all throughout redemptive history, it's God remembers, God remembers, God remembers, right? Meaning that what he was doing in the creation, what he's doing with Noah, what he is doing with Israel, what he's doing, he does not forget.</p><p>He does not change his mind. God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent, right? Has he not said it, and will he not do it? If God said it, he will do it, even though it may seem as impossible, when you lose all hope, right?</p><p>Because you just cannot see, well, how can God do this, and why would God do this? He says God remembers, right? So what he is doing here with Noah, what he is doing with the nation of Israel, he says he will remember, and you see that all throughout redemptive history.</p><p>God never changes his mind or his purpose, okay? And he, and Book of Hebrews says, nor can he do so, he cannot change, right? Which means when he says, tells us to remember, obviously we have a tendency to forget, but he, when he tells us to remember, he's telling us more than just think about it.</p><p>He's, he's telling us to be faithful to the covenant, because God is faithful to us, that we are to remember, and to be faithful to him, okay? This physical, uh, I remember the very first movie that my dad took us to in Philadelphia in 1975, when we came to the United States.</p><p>He made such a big deal, and we went to the theater, so excited, and there was a documentary on how they found Noah's Ark on the mountain of Turkey, and we didn't even understand English at that time. So I remember to vow never to watch an American movie again, because if this is what an American movie looks like, right?</p><p>But there's so many, so many documentaries of people looking for it, and I don't actually have pictures, but they do think, okay, again, it's not proven that somewhere in Turkey that they have a place where it looks like, whether they found wood pieces, or the shape of it, and sitting on the top of one of the mountains over there.</p><p>Um, if you Google it, you'll easily find it. There's tons of pictures, okay? So the fact that God left evidence, right? And my guess is, by the time Moses was riding it, Moses knew exactly where this boat was. That's my thought, right? Because it's not that far removed. Okay.</p><p>Uh, next question. God was so clear about how to build the ark, and what to collect, and yet when it was time to exit the ark, right, Noah had to go through all this ritual of finding, is it dry, is it not? Uh, why do you think God didn't give specific instructions after the flood?</p><p>Now, again, this is just conjecture, uh, but if you look at the pattern in which God works, there's a tendency to people think that whenever you see God working a certain way that that's how God's going to work in every single instance, right? God spoke to, you know, to Paul.</p><p>God spoke to Moses. And so you're waiting, I'm waiting for God to speak to me. Is that the typical pattern in which God works is through the prophets through the written word, right? And so God was very engaged with, with them early on, even, even in Noah's life. It wasn't like every single day God gave specific instruction, do this, turn left, turn right.</p><p>And, uh, I remember, especially in the charismatic camp, they think that whatever you see is a pattern that, that needs to be repeated. But I remember two of my roommates who were very charismatic, who are older than me, uh, right before they got married, I remember them being so disappointed.</p><p>And the reason why they were disappointed is because they thought that God was going to give them some special revelation as to who they were supposed to marry. But that never happened. So they were thinking, huh, this is not what we thought. And at the end, the end conclusion of both of them, two separate times being married was, oh, this is just, I just need to make a wise, godly choice, right?</p><p>Um, the whole reason why I point this out is because even Noah, how God spoke to him in the beginning and at the end was very different. Okay. This is not a normal pattern that we are to wait for, like God for me to speak and say, do you want me to do this?</p><p>Or do you want me to do that? Right? God says to not to conform to the pattern of this world, but renew your mind that you may be able to test and approve the will of God, that which is perfect and good. Right? So we are by renewing our mind through the word of God, through repentance, that, that we are to be able to discern the will of God.</p><p>Right? So God's given that to us. And then you see right off the bat, Noah built an altar, offered a burnt offering, and once they exited, where in the Bible does it, does this come out? Obviously, Leviticus chapter one. So right off the bat, the sacrifices teach that sin requires death.</p><p>Right? Sin requires death, right? That's one of the first things that is taught in the sacrificial system. That it is a bloody scene at the altar, that they are being slaughtered, and the blood is being sprinkled everywhere. The fact that this was given not only at the tabernacle, but this was being practiced from the very beginning.</p><p>Sin requires death. God provided a way to live, right? Through the sacrifice of the animals that they were atoned for, right? By faith, knowing that the true atonement was going to come in Christ. And then again, the blood atonement was necessary, right? Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins, right?</p><p>And so this was embedded from the beginning, right? In Genesis chapter three, it says the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent. And so the specifics of that, even though it doesn't mention it there, the specifics of the coming of Christ was embedded into their daily practice, right?</p><p>And so we see that right off the bat, as soon as Noah comes up, the first thing that he does is he offers sacrifice, right? One, out of thanksgiving, but two, he knew that this was the only way that he can have a relationship with this holy God, okay?</p><p>So all of this is preparation for the coming of Christ, okay? All right, so this is the study question for chapter nine. I'm not going to go through it. I think it's pretty self-explanatory. And then here's the discussion questions, okay? Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you go to get to your discussion.</p><p>Father, we thank you for your mercies. We thank you, Father God, that you do remember that everything that you have chosen to do and will to do, that you do, that you are faithful to your promises, whether it is to Noah, to his family, to Israel, to the church, to us, that our confidence may not come, Lord God, because of who we are, but because of who you are.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to ground our faith firmly upon an unchanging love of who you are, and help us to even understand, Lord God, that we are living in a period of grace, knowing that one day, that even though it may not be through a flood, that the judgment will come.</p><p>So help us, Lord God, to live like people who are preparing and being ready, that we may not be caught off like a thief coming in the night. So we ask, Lord God, that you would bless this time of discussion. Sanctify us and renew us, Lord God, through this time.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
