I'm glad we can come together to remember the salvation that Christ has accomplished. And as we reflect upon that during the whole week, this evening, after our worship time, we're gonna have our brother Adam Wong come up and share his salvation testimony. And then we'll continue reflecting on today, Silent Wednesday, as we think about the events that took place leading up to Christ going to the cross. Let's take a moment to pray as we enter into time of worship. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God, for your grace. Lord, I pray that as we are coming each night to reflect and think, may all the various steps that you took continue, Lord, to help us appreciate the magnificent work that you have accomplished. Help us, Father God, to reflect on every angle of the gospel. Help us to see, Father Lord, the weight of sin that we, as human race, have exhibited, Lord, in our lives. And I pray, Father God, that all the more we would be seeking you, all the more we'd be thankful to you, Lord, for your great work. We pray, Father God, that as a lot of us are coming in just from our workplaces, perhaps a little bit fatigued, Lord, would you grant to us great spiritual energy to be able to just lift up to you our song, also to be able to hear the words and be refreshed. And God, that ultimately, Lord, all things would turn to you in great adoration and worship. We lift this time up to you, Lord, that's in Christ, and we pray. Amen. Let's all rise. Praise the Lord, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Lord, when thou could remember the wrongs we have done Unleash it on all we who pass not their sin Thrown into a sea where the bottom was shore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Praise the Lord, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more When patience would wait as we constantly wait What Father so tender is calling us home He welcomes the weak, He's the valest, the poor Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Praise the Lord, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more  What riches of kindness we've managed to miss His blood was a payment, His life was a cost We stand at the dead, we could never afford Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Praise the Lord, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Praise the Lord, His mercy is more Stronger than darkness, new and evermore Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more Amen  What is our hope in life and death? Christ alone, Christ alone What is our only confidence? That our souls to Him belong Who holds our days when in His hand Who comes apart from His command And what will keep us to the end? The love of Christ in which we stand Oh, sing hallelujah Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah Now and ever we confess Christ our hope in life and death  Truth can calm the troubled soul God is good, God is good There is His grace and goodness known In our grave, Redeemer's blood Who holds our faith when fears arise Who stands above the stormy trial Who sends a wave that brings us safe Unto the shore of the rock of trial Oh, sing hallelujah Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah Now and ever we confess Christ our hope in life and death  Into the grave what will we sing?

Alright. My name is Adam Wong and I'm thankful and excited to share my testimony because I believe it might resonate with a lot of you and it testifies to God's grace. It's kind of funny, I feel like the last two sharings with Pastor Peter Chung and Pastor Nate have basically been just a summary of my own testimony. In short, the Lord saved me through showing me my self-righteousness and by leading me to faith in Christ alone for salvation through the preaching of his word and the reading of his word. My whole life I lived in the Christian community. I was born into the same church that my parents grew up in where they met, where they served, where they were married in. All my life I've known about God. I've read the Bible. I sang the songs. I used to say that I first believed it when I was five. But when I look back on that confession, I don't believe it was true. There was more of a desire to please my parents than to truly repent and believe in Christ. But most of my life I thought I was a believer. I looked the part and I played the part. I jumped into serving the church and into leadership roles. Why? The same reason why I first professed Christ. Out of a fear of man and wanting to please those around me. The kingdom I was building was my own pleasure, my own reputation before others. Jesus was simply a means to that end. Most of my life at church was marked by being the good church boy. Of course I wasn't perfect. I would admit that I wasn't perfect so that I wouldn't sound prideful. But overall I didn't see my sins as the main issue. And it showed how I lived totally different at school. I was a bully, a punk, a classically rebellious kid. Whatever I could do to be seen as someone reputable or cool or approved by people, I pursued it. At school the context was different from church, but the problem was the same. The kingdom I was building was my own. I lived these two different lives seeking the approval of man wherever I could with a small view of my sin and a small view of God. But by the grace of God, he began to shake me from this place of self-centered double living. It was in my sophomore year of high school that I began to slowly understand that the gospel was more than just a Sunday thing. The gospel was more than just a church thing, a tradition from our family, more than just a good lesson. It wasn't through some kind of life-changing experience or one particular retreat or one particular pastor's sermon that I came to understand the truth. God graciously broke down my pride through the weekly preaching of his word and through my personal reading of his word. Slowly yet surely, I began to believe. I began to see my deep sinfulness, my hopelessness before God's holy judgment. I began to see the wickedness in trying to use God for my glory when it's all about him. I saw that left to myself, I turned to sin again and again and again. How quickly I could turn something like vacuuming the church into a way to glorify myself. How prideful in that. While I have maybe even went to church and read my Bible with a legalistic heart, by the grace of God, he used that so that I would see my sin. Not only that I would see it, but that I would see Jesus. That the good news of his blood covers all of that sinfulness that I was starting to feel and see and realize. Faith in his work and his resurrection brings life to my soul. He is the only way of life, not by my works, not by how much I served, not by how long I spent at church, how many dishes I cleaned, how much I knew or how much I was accepted by people. And the solution was not to dig in deeper once I saw my sin, to memorize more, to read more, etc., etc. I needed to look to Christ. And coming to this truth I realized, if I'm going to look to Christ, I can't live this double life at school. If I was one with Christ and if I was called to follow him, then I must be one person. Though I've had seasons of doubt looking back even on sophomore year, my confession of faith, I've come to believe it was genuine, that there was faith there, even as small as a mustard seed. And I'm thankful to God for his love to me. Just as we've heard the last two days, God hates self-exalting religion. He hated how the religious elite used worship of him as a way to profit themselves. In God's anger and in his mercy and in his love, he exposes that sin to them. And while they harden their hearts and remain deluded in self-glory, I can say that it's by the grace of God that he allowed me to see my sin and to see my need. Someone who didn't feel like he needed to see that, he showed me. Not the hours of sermons I listened to or the number of books that I've read that opened my eyes. Church family, it was simply his grace. So while I still struggle with the fear of man at times, I'm thankful for his inviting and loving grace. How often have I overtly or subtly tried to use him for my glory. And in his judgment, I deserve to be left alone to my sin. But Jesus was gracious and is still gracious to show me again and again the sickness of my sin, the perversion of my self-glorifying church boy ways. But all this that I might fall at his feet in desperate need and love. A verse that's constantly been coming to my mind is Luke 747. For this reason I say to you, her sins which are many have been forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. Before I didn't realize how much I needed to be forgiven. But now I see, I've been forgiven much. In the coldness and the hardness of my heart, the Lord opened my eyes to see sin. And has shown me forgiveness in Christ. By his grace I believe and I want to love him much. Thank you.  Okay. As we continue to reflect upon this week and just again, the various aspects of what Christ has accomplished, we're so thankful for everything that Christ has done. Thank you Adam for sharing how the Lord has been good to you with us. At this time let's take a moment to turn in our Bibles to Matthew 26, verses 14-19. Matthew 26, verses 14-19. Today is called Silent Wednesday. And here we see a narrative of what Judas did during this day. Let's take a moment to read this passage. Matthew 16, verses 14-19. And it says, "Then one of the twelve named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priest and said, 'What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?' And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus. Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' And he said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I am to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' The disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they prepared the Passover." Real briefly, I want to review the various events of the past few weeks using the graphic that our media team shared. That on Saturday of the week they came to Bethany and they stayed over at Mary, Martha, and Lazarus' house. And the thing about it is, by this time, anywhere Jesus went there was already a crowd. There was already a massive crowd and because Lazarus had been raised from the dead, there is just this massive amount of people that are trying to always see Jesus. That always upset the Pharisees and the religious leaders of the day. On Sunday, Jesus enters into Jerusalem and saying there are masses of people is an understatement. I mean, there were hordes of people praising him with palm branches, saying, "Hosanna, Hosanna," which essentially means, "Save us, save us, O son of David." And so, that also upset the religious leaders of the time to the degree they were commanding Jesus, "Make them stop." And then on Monday, Jesus went into the temple and cleared it, disrupting the corrupt economy of the temple, you know, essentially marketplace. That, sure, upset the religious leaders of the time. Just like we reviewed yesterday, Jesus went head-to-head in heated debates, saying parables and describing specific depictions, and the Pharisees and the religious leaders knew that Jesus was talking about them. And so, that upset the religious leaders even more. Essentially, what we see as things are developing is there is a ramping up of the hatred of Christ. And Pastor Nate eloquently said yesterday night that there was murderous intent by this time. Already, they wanted him to either be quiet, be disproved, or, you know, or completely thrown off, or seen as a fake, but by this time, they just wanted to eliminate him, right? And what you have, essentially, Judas, I think that Judas was one that was paying attention to all that was going on. You see, perhaps some of the other disciples, maybe Peter might have been thinking, "Ah, Jesus, you stick to him," right? Because there are a lot of Jews who wanted Jesus to be a revolutionary. And perhaps there was a lot of people who were already in the community who had angst towards the already established system. Clearly, they had angst towards the ruling power, right? Maybe the sons of thunder, right? They were like, "Yeah, bring it down!" Every time he went head-to-head in a debate, maybe they were just sitting there pumping their fists, and going, "Ooh, that's right, burn!" You know? And they were just egging him on. I think perhaps Judas was sitting there like, "This crazy guy. He told us he was going to die, but look at him, flipping tables, challenging the authorities. These high priests, these scribes, these Pharisees and Sadducees, they had temple officers. They had security guards. They had soldiers of their own. A lot of times, they enacted capital punishment when they felt that certain crimes fit the bill." Judas is sitting here like, "This guy is nuts. He's probably going to die." Why? Because sometimes, mistakenly, people say the disciples didn't really get it. They didn't really know that Jesus was going to go to the cross. No, actually, starting from Matthew 16, and even prior to then, Jesus was already both hinting and then explicitly told them, "I am going to suffer." For example, Matthew 16, 21 through 22 says, "From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things from the elders and chief priests, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. That's when Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'God forbid it. Lord, this shall never happen to you.'" The disciples knew, they just didn't like the idea. Another example, Matthew 17, 22, 23, "And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. He will be raised on the third day.' And they were deeply grieved." So, fact. Not only in these instances, but you can count about five instances where Jesus was explicitly clear. Prior to that, Jesus also hinted, "The Son of Man must be lifted. The Son of Man must suffer." There were enough pre-disclosures, so to speak, that the disciples should have known if they were paying attention. But the fact of the matter is, they were just wondering, "Huh? Is that a good idea?" They just didn't like it. Judas essentially then understood Jesus' statements. He understood, you know, point 1A. He just did not also understand point 1B. In his eyes, he was thinking, "Oh my goodness, this rabbi of ours, this lord and master of ours, is going to get us killed." It's probably what he was thinking. Jesus is going to get himself killed and us along with him. I believe Judas was a calculating man. He was the individual who was taking care of the money bag for the group. He was the man, do you remember, when the lady came, broke the alabaster, and was anointing Jesus? He was the first one who said, "What a waste! You know, that could have been sold? For the poor, of course." He was a quick calculating man who understood Jesus was going to get himself killed. And so, as an opportunist, he decides to get in on the game. "If Jesus is going to be killed by the Pharisees, then at least I'm going to benefit from it." What I found very interesting was that I just always assumed that the scribes and Pharisees were looking for an opportunity to kill Jesus, so they kind of egged on one of the disciples. Maybe one of the Pharisees came along and said, "Come here. Let me give you some money." Or something like that. Some deal went down. After reviewing the details of this passage, notice how in this passage in Matthew 26, verse 14, it says that Judas actually went and asked this question of them, "What are you willing to give me?" And Judas, at this point, didn't even have a plan yet. But what he was doing was he was working with both the Pharisees and the temple officers, those soldiers I was talking about, to devise a plan from that time. And I thought this was really interesting, because at that moment, then, Judas didn't even have everything planned out. As a matter of fact, he, in my eyes, didn't even add that much to the plan. Do you ever think about that? What did Judas add to the plan of betraying Christ? I mean, you could readily see where Jesus was. There was a crowd following him. And then I realized this is the only thing, essentially, Judas was adding to the betrayal and the scheme. The Pharisees, because of their fear of man, wanted to find Jesus in a secluded moment. They wanted to avoid the crowds. And so, here in this passage, if you take a look in Luke 22, verse 3 through 6, it says, "Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the Twelve, and he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. They were glad and agreed with him money. So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd." Do you see that? I'm highlighting these aspects of the story because we're taking a look at Judas and his perspective. And to me, what's really interesting about all this is there was such a greed in Judas' heart that I believe Satan seized that, entered into him, and played on him. Now, just as a quick side note, the story is quite crazy because we recognize that everything that is happening is absolutely according to the timetable of God. God is so sovereign that everything is falling into place and the Scripture is being fulfilled. Nevertheless, Satan is also entering into Judas, fulfilling his schemes and his devices. But also, Judas himself is a foolish, greedy man, seizing the opportunity. You see everything in play. And what Judas is doing is he is trying to, I think, make up perhaps for some lost time. If Jesus is going to go out, at least I'm going to recoup a little bit of money. What's really crazy about this is the passage in Matthew says that they offered, when he asked, "How much will you give me?" they offered 30 pieces of silver. When I reviewed that, I was like, "Wait a minute. It's not even gold." This guy is nuts. 30 pieces of silver in that time would be worth about five weeks' wage, they say. It's a month wage. A lord, a rabbi, a master, even to this individual, walking with him for three years, and yet for a single month's wage, he'd be willing to say, "Deal. I consent." This is a greedy individual. And what I like to say is this. When an individual gives into one's greed, it makes the individual absolutely foolish. The plan is so foolish, Jesus himself calls it foolish. The plan is so foolish, when you read it, you kind of wonder, truly, Judas didn't even add much to the entire scheme of things. As a matter of fact, in this passage I want to highlight for you, in Matthew 26, verse 55 through 56, it says, "At that time, Jesus said to the crowds who had gathered," so this, right now, what I'm reading, is when the people actually try to come and seize Jesus, he asked this question, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place to fulfill the scriptures of the prophets. Then all the disciples left him and fled." Jesus is essentially saying, "This is dumb. I was with you every single day. You had to scheme, trying to catch me." And then the funny thing about it is they're trying to avoid a crowd, but there was already a crowd. Jesus was speaking to the crowd there. But essentially, when I think about this, I think about, as a reflection and meditation, there is such a greed in Judas' heart that we can reflect on. We ask the question, "If we are tempted with this, I guess, expectation of what is Jesus going to avail to me, what kind of benefit, or perhaps if Satan would tempt us with this kind of complaint, this is a waste of time. Or perhaps the angst and frustration that perhaps we live in this day, where Satan puts these foolish words into our head, where we start to complain and say, "I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I'm tired of going town to town. I'm tired of asking. I'm tired of going through the village and having to pick up the leftover grain." Those kinds of sentiments, what does that reveal? I think those kind of sentiments are the sentiments essentially pervasive in this generation. And so I want to give you this question. When Judas is tempted with this betrayal, this disloyalty, I wonder if his reason and rationale for him following Jesus in the first place is actually the exact same reason why he is betraying him now. If Judas thought like the rest of the disciples, "Hey, Jesus, look at you. Look at the crowds on our side. Look at all the people. You've got number on your side. So now tell us who's going to be on your right and left." I'm pretty sure Judas was also listening. "Yes, Jesus, tell us who is going to be on your right and left." And so what's really interesting about this is with Judas' greed and his looking to Christ for some kind of benefit, even if at least you're going to gain me this 30 shekels, 30 silver. That is a horrible, horrible sentiment. But what I liken it to is somebody who has Jesus in their garage. What do I mean? I believe one of the grave sins of this generation is a lot of time people like holding on to Christ as something of value, valuable enough that I can't throw him away. They'll like to have him in his garage just in case we need him. But when the opportune time comes, we might have a garage sale. Because at least if I sell it, then I'll have some money. What's really crazy about all this, again, is we can reflect on lots of different things. Oh my gosh, incredible amounts of vanity that Judas would walk with Jesus for so long and be able to betray him in that moment. But in the end, when greed takes control of the heart, we would do all kinds of heinous things. And so as a reflection and challenge to us, I want to ask you, do you have any of these discontent, disappointed sentiments, perhaps even a grumbling complaint against Christ? Lord, what have you done for me though? Why aren't you helping me though? If that is the case, we have to be very careful, amen? Now what I would like to highlight by way of closing thought is not so much Judas, because there is still nevertheless Jesus who is exhibiting incredible amounts of composure. What I'm trying to say is, today, although it is Silent Wednesday, let us not just simply think about Judas the sinner, the betrayer, one who is, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, it must have been better for you not to have been born," because woe is the one who would betray the Son of God. But let's actually focus on the Son of God, who is to be appreciated for His incredible composure. When I think about the events leading up to this week, I mean, I think about like Jesus knowing what He knows in terms of what is filled in the heart of man. Jesus knew all along that there would be a betrayer. Jesus knows when people are asking Him questions, "Tell us, Jesus. Show us a sign, Jesus." He knows what is contained in the heart of all those who would ask Him and accuse Him. When He is walking into the city in Jerusalem, all these individuals praising Him and giving Him branches, He knows what's in their heart. When He is debating, when He is engaged in all the teaching and the debates and the fierce combats with the scribes of the day, He knows what's in their hearts. And while Judas thinks He's secretly going and making a deal, is Jesus not aware? Jesus is absolutely aware. Tomorrow, during the Passover, Jesus calls it out, "He whose hand is on the table with Me will betray Me." And all the disciples are like, "Not me. Not me." And He could have easily said, "And you will deny Me, and you will run, and you will..." But the composure. When I reflect on the passages when Jesus says, "I did not come to judge," every single step of the way, I'm sitting there thinking, "Thank You, Lord, because if I were You, I would sit there and call out every single person. You liar! You two-faced!" Right? And then even here, to be aware that Judas is doing this, and then has the audacity come with the rest of the disciples to share in the meal where Jesus is instituting the new covenant, and He's explaining to them, "This is My body broken, My blood shed for you." Can you imagine? I can't imagine that. I can't imagine, like, sometimes you put yourself in the shoes, thinking that this is the bread broken for you, and you would just look and be like, "Not you." And then you just move on. We thank the Lord. Lord, thank You that You did not come first to judge, but You came first to show mercy. And so, Scripture talks about the greatness of Christ. 1 Peter 2, verse 21-24, says, "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth. And while being reviled, He did not revile in return. While suffering, He uttered no threats." And then I would add, "While being betrayed." Right? "While being betrayed, He did not react, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously. And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. For by His wounds, you were healed." Amen. Let us continue to reflect and recognize, when Christ entered into that scene and was going to the cross, the scene is horrific because there's just so much corruption, waywardness, and sin around Him. And what would feel natural if you put yourself in His shoes would be, "You should just judge all of them right now." And so we praise Christ, and we pray in appreciation. What great composure, what great dedication to fulfill Your merciful, saving grace. Let's take time now to pray. Would you take a moment to examine your heart? Is there any greedy expectation? Is there any grumbling complaint upon Christ, disappointment in your heart? But also, let's quickly turn that around to say to the Lord, "God, we appreciate every aspect of what You've done, even making sure that You walk through all of these necessary steps, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, but that Your mercy would be fulfilled upon the cross." Let's take some time to pray.      Let us rise for the closing song.   Turn your eyes upon Jesus But fall in His wonderful face And the things of earth will grow strangely dim In the light of His glory and grace Turn your eyes upon Jesus But fall in His wonderful face And the things of earth will grow strangely dim In the light of His glory and grace Turn your eyes upon Jesus But fall in His wonderful face And the things of earth will grow strangely dim In the light of His glory and grace  Amen. Let's pray together. Our God, as we reflect upon truly Your work, and all the things that You have accomplished, we also reflect upon the fact that in Your great humility, You have chosen to take such a path that would cause you to experience the humiliation to allow yourself to be betrayed by a simple human being. It's beyond our comprehension, Lord. And so, God, we praise You and thank You. And, Lord, I pray, God, that these moments of review would be to us nourishment, that God, from remembering, we would adore You. And I pray, Father God, that not only in this moment, but regularly throughout our day, You would cause us to walk with You in such a way, God, that we're lifting up to You our praise and thankfulness every moment of the day, Lord. We thank You. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Thank you, everyone. Have a great evening.</p></div></body></html>
