I guess I'll say I'm thankful for this church, for Berean. I'm thankful for Berean Community Church. I think just Berean. I'm thankful for the community of believers that are at Berean. How it's just really God-centered. Taught me to love and grow in my faith more. Really pushed me and challenged me to grow in my faith. I'm thankful for all the pastors and all their service. I'm very thankful for Pastor Peter. Our faithful teacher, Pastor Peter. Being the father figure for all of us at this church family. I'm thankful that I have examples like him and examples like Pastor Mark and his dedication to the word and not being afraid to say what needs to be said. I'm thankful for all the brothers and sisters. You guys are all great, great people. I'm just thankful for the community that God's just provided for me over the past few years. For all of the brothers and sisters who are so dedicated not only to growing in their own faith but also dedicated to encouraging one another and to really spur each other on towards faith and good works. Yeah. I'm really thankful for everything. And I'm just thankful for everything. I'm thankful for Berean Lunches. This guy, God has blessed us with a son this year. Thankful for my wonderful wife. My fiancee Leah. My roommates. Family, friends, the people here at Berean. People that have prayed for me and sharing. Just the privilege that we have to be able to be in the Lord's army and to be able to be herald of the gospel because it is truly a miracle, an amazing thing to see someone come from death to life.</p></div></body></html>
