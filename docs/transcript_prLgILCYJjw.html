Good evening, everybody. Let's take our seats and get ready for worship as we start our time of Bible study. Okay. Please join with me in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we gather our hearts and our thoughts to you. Lord, as you day by day teach us from your word and your spirit guiding us to live in a manner that is holy unto you, growing in sanctification, growing in depth of knowledge, would you bless us spiritually to appreciate our salvation more and more in Christ.</p><p>God, we pray that you would continue to guide our thoughts to know what it means to live every day according to faith, according to your spirit and your love. And God, we pray that, Lord, as we come each week, you would edify us, helping us, Lord, lay aside all the things that are encumbrances, things that are baggage, and continue to lay those things down at the foot of the cross.</p><p>And so now as we sing to you and lift up our voices and our words, we ask, God, that this be a time that is honoring to you but also sweet to our souls. It's in Christ's name. Amen. >> Father, you are worthy of praise and glory and honor, and we thank you for sending your son to rescue us from the bondage of sin and giving us new life so that we might find freedom and righteousness in Christ.</p><p>I pray, Lord, as your word goes forth today, may it penetrate our heart, and may we return to you worship that you deserve through all our conduct, our acts, our singing, our prayer, and everything that worship be given to you. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen. We'll be back at 8.</p></div></body></html>
