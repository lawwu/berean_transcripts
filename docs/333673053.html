so I hope you took some time to study before you came and look through the names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=130s">00:02:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, typically when you're reading through the Bible, when you get to a passage like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=133s">00:02:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this, it's just kind of flip over, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=136s">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you probably don't recognize the majority of them and out of maybe about six or seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=141s">00:02:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">different names, you might have remembered some of them if you've read the New Testament</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=146s">00:02:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">before, maybe Paphroditus and maybe Onesimus, but because you're not familiar with the names,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=151s">00:02:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you think, well, it's kind of hard, I don't know anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=154s">00:02:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could easily just kind of bypass this chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=157s">00:02:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you were there with our study with the book of Romans, when we got to chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=161s">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">16, there was so much of the church history stated in the names that are mentioned in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=167s">00:02:47.160</a></span> | <span

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=169s">00:02:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is no different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=171s">00:02:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">When you actually study the names and who these people were and how they were involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=175s">00:02:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and how God was using them, it basically gives you a glimpse of the New Testament in a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=181s">00:03:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">light,

surrounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=189s">00:03:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostle Paul, you get a completely different view of what's going on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=194s">00:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so we're going to jump right in and then I'm going to give you, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=198s">00:03:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to give you a

down the list of these names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=210s">00:03:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div

comes to Rome, remember he's sitting in Palestine for two years because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=335s">00:05:35.640</a></span> | <span

the trial begins, and then he begins his journey to Rome as a prisoner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=360s">00:06:00.560</a></span> | <span

the reason why he's a fellow prisoner of Paul, that he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=845s">00:14:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with him and then he was caught with him and why he was being dragged along all this time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=849s">00:14:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because he was probably a very close companion of Apostle Paul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/333673053#t=852s">00:14:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it had to be more than just a companion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
