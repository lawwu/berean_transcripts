I trust everyone slept well? Maybe? Sort of? It is a hotel, it's not home? Well last night we looked at who we pray to or to whom do we pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=29s">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And looking at God and His power and the position He holds as our Father. And why we can come boldly, as we just sang, come boldly to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=47s">00:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've seen who it is that we are praying to. Today we're going to look at why we pray. How we pray. We know that we come boldly because we have been reconciled to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=67s">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our entrance into that throne room is ensured through the perfect work of Jesus' life, His death, and His resurrection. It's through those things, through Him coming as a man, through Him dying upon the cross, that we have become His children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=88s">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That we have been adopted as His children. And so as His children we know that He is going to respond to us as our loving Father. He's going to hear our requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=102s">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says even in Psalms that as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear Him. So knowing who God is, His power, His ability to work His purposes, knowing that He is our loving Father, that He is our friend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=125s">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that is what enables us to pray. That's how we come boldly into the throne of grace. And it also propels us to prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=135s">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about human relationships, when you have a good friend, do you call them up because you have to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you spend time with them and take time out of your schedule and the other things that you're doing to spend time with your friend because it's a duty?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=155s">00:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you have to? No! We spend time with our friends and our loved ones because we want to. We enjoy sharing our lives with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We enjoy telling them what happened in our day. We enjoy talking to them about our problems. And so far more than just a human friend or loved one, God actually has the ability to speak into our lives with power, with the ability to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=186s">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also approach Him as our Father, and sometimes it is just about telling Him about our day, isn't it? It's not necessarily that something needs to change, but just this is what's going on, relating that to the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So knowing that God is our Father propels us to the throne room where we want to spend time with Him. It isn't a duty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=213s">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In order for us to have that relationship, something had to happen, didn't it? We talked about the life and death and resurrection of Christ, that it is through that that we can come boldly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, why was that necessary? Well, it was necessary because our sin caused conflict and a broken relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=239s">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of our sin, our relationship with God that we saw in the garden when God created Adam and Eve, and it says they walked with Him in the cool of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=250s">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What were they doing? They were sharing life with God. But when Adam and Eve sinned, that fellowship was broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=261s">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that chasm was so great between us and God because of our sin that there was only one thing that could bridge that gap, and that was the death of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=274s">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about reconciliation as far as, again, our human relationships go, when is reconciliation needed? It's when that relationship has broken down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=285s">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know that our relationship was broken with God because of our sin, but our relationships can break between us and other people for all kinds of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=294s">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we fix that? Through reconciliation. And that can look a lot of different ways, can't it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=302s">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we've offended that person and we need to do something to show our remorse and make it up to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We could never make up to God the offense that our sin is against Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we lived our entire lives with the sole purpose of somehow trying to make it up to God for our sin against Him, we would not be able to accomplish it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=329s">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing that we could ever do would make it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=335s">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It amazes me that God didn't choose to just write us off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=341s">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He wasn't under any obligation to fix the relationship that we broke with Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=349s">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But God's Word tells us that God so loved us that He sent His precious, beloved Son to die for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=360s">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how important a relationship with us is in God's eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=366s">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That He was willing to pay such a high price to bring reconciliation with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=373s">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that God needs us. He does not need us in any way, shape, or form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=377s">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But He is love. God is love. God isn't a loving God. God is love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=384s">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is who He is. And so He chose, out of the good pleasure of His will, to send His Son to bring us back into fellowship with Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=395s">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what our reconciliation means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=400s">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Last year, I had the opportunity to go to the Together for the Gospel conference for women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=405s">00:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Timothy Keller was talking about this exact issue of our relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=411s">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "Prayer is friendship with God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=416s">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is a God of relationship. We see that even within the Trinity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=421s">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God has a relationship within the Godhead between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=426s">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when it says that God made us in His image, He made us to be relational beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=431s">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And He made us, He created us, to have a relationship with Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=435s">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">That was the relationship that He designed us to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=445s">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span

Jesus accomplished our reconciliation through His death,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=455s">00:07:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it was so much more than delivering us from the punishment our sin deserved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=463s">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think sometimes when we think about our salvation, we think, "Okay, I was condemned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=468s">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My sin, the punishment of it was for me to die eternally, to be in hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=473s">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And God, through His Son and the death on the cross, delivered me from that punishment."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=478s">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is absolutely and completely biblical and true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=482s">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is not the full extent of our reconciliation with God, of the salvation He's given us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=491s">00:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the beginning of the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=495s">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So through that reconciliation, what do we have now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=499s">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=503s">00:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We no longer have this chasm, this conflict that has been caused by our sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=508s">00:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When Jesus' blood covered our sin, it made peace with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=515s">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That peace was that first step in bringing us back into relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=521s">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're able to communicate with God that we are at peace with God, we can share our lives with Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/215356854#t=527s">00:08:47.000</a></span> | <span
