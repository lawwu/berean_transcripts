Japan! Woo!   Your glorious cause, O God, engages our hearts. May Jesus Christ be known wherever we are. We ask not for ourselves, but for Your renown. The cross has saved us, so we pray, Your kingdom come. Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done, so that everyone might know Your name. Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth until Your sovereign work on earth is done. Let Your kingdom come.  Give us Your strength, O God, and courage to speak. Perform Your wondrous deeds through those who are weak. Lord, use us as You want, whatever the test. By grace we'll preach Your gospel 'til our dying breath. Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done, so that everyone might know Your name. Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth until Your sovereign work on earth is done. Let Your kingdom come. Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done, so that everyone might know Your name. Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth until Your sovereign work is done. Let Your kingdom come. Let Your will be done, so that everyone might know Your name. Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth until Your sovereign work on earth is done. Let Your kingdom come. Let Your kingdom come.</p></div></body></html>
