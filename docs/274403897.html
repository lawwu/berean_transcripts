you look at the bottom of the question, review questions for Leviticus, I made it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=61s">00:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody pointed out on number one, it says, "Try to put to memory chiastic outlining of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=71s">00:01:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, I didn't mean Revelation, I meant Leviticus.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=97s">00:01:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Help us to glean from your word what you desire for us, that we may learn and grow and continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=103s">00:01:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep you at the center of all that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=105s">00:01:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We pray for your blessing over this time in Jesus' name we pray, amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=110s">00:01:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so in the chiastic form of the book of Revelation, chapter 17 is the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=116s">00:01:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the next section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=117s">00:01:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I kind of debated not to do 17 and wait for us to start it next time, but I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=123s">00:02:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">think it matters too much because we're going to end up reviewing anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=126s">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=127s">00:02:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so the chapter 17 is the beginning of the structure of the second part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=136s">00:02:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you remember the chiastic form, and again, please try to put that to memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=145s">00:02:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not talking about, you don't have to know like what's in every single chapter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=148s">00:02:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but at least that broad outline, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=150s">00:02:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 1, like A, I, 1A, and then going backwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=155s">00:02:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last two chapters is sort of a blessing discipline response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=159s">00:02:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sort of a summary chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=161s">00:02:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=162s">00:02:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But at least know the chiastic structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=164s">00:02:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I asked you what's in chapter 17, 18, 19, that you kind of have some idea that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=170s">00:02:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about the laws of cleanliness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=173s">00:02:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If I talked, asked you what was in chapter 11 through 15, that you also know that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=178s">00:02:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">also about laws of cleanliness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=180s">00:03:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=181s">00:03:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So at least have that structure in mind so that you know exactly where we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=187s">00:03:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say in the future you're studying and you're learning about the gospel and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=190s">00:03:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">say, well, you know, what does the Bible say about blood?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=194s">00:03:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you kind of have a general outline of where you would want to go in the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=199s">00:03:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of Revelation, not Revelation, Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=202s">00:03:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=203s">00:03:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=204s">00:03:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to ask you guys to do your best to put this to memory, this outline to memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=208s">00:03:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In chapter 17, fits into the number two, after the day of atonement, laws of clean and unclean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=215s">00:03:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=216s">00:03:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously you can see from 17 to 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=218s">00:03:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the difference from the first part of the kiastic outline versus the second part?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=228s">00:03:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the distinction between the first part and second part?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=231s">00:03:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is he just going to repeat what he said in the first part?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=233s">00:03:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you guys remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=235s">00:03:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about this briefly when we went over the outline the first time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=240s">00:04:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=245s">00:04:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=247s">00:04:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first part, chapter one, all the way to chapter 15, highlighted in chapter 16,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=252s">00:04:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at the outline, it says almost the exact same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=256s">00:04:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the first part of it up to chapter 15, the emphasis is at the tabernacle and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=261s">00:04:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the priest, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=262s">00:04:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">For the purpose of staying clean and pure and their sins atoned for, for the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=269s">00:04:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=271s">00:04:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The second part of it, the emphasis is in the life of the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=274s">00:04:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=276s">00:04:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to follow the same outline backward, but the emphasis, it doesn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=280s">00:04:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not going to talk about the tabernacle, it's going to talk about the priesthood, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=283s">00:04:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's working backwards, talking about with the emphasis on the community of Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=288s">00:04:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=290s">00:04:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=291s">00:04:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 17 is going to kick us off into that section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=296s">00:04:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So after the introduction in verse one and two, we go straight into the regulations concerning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=301s">00:05:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=304s">00:05:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So the two broad outline of this chapter is regulations on the location of the sacrifice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=312s">00:05:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and regulation of eating blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=316s">00:05:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And it falls into verses three to nine, the first section, and then eating the blood in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=320s">00:05:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">verses 10 through 16.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=322s">00:05:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a broad outline that if you've read it, you probably already noticed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=328s">00:05:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we're talking about is going to be falling under those two categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=332s">00:05:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the regulation concerning the location is concerning the sacrificial slaughter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=337s">00:05:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrificial animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=339s">00:05:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me make sure that you understand that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=341s">00:05:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not talking about just any animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=343s">00:05:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">These are animals that you've probably noticed in the earlier chapters where these animals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=349s">00:05:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">whether they were goats or whether they were different lambs or ox, all of them were animals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=355s">00:05:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that were prescribed to be offered as sacrifices at the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=359s">00:05:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So these weren't just any animals, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/274403897#t=363s">00:06:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's verse three to six.</span></div><div
