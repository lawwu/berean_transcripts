(audience chattering) Good evening, everyone. We're gonna go ahead and get started with Bible study. So if you haven't already, please go ahead and find your seats and we'll get started in a moment. I'll go ahead and pray for us. Let's all pray together. Father, thank you for gathering us here this evening to study your word. We thank you, Lord, for your word that guides us as we wander on this earth, Lord. We just pray that we're reminded of our value, our purpose, and our calling. It's not to fulfill our own glory, but to be obedient, to walk in your commandments, to walk in truth. To be ones who are set apart from the world, Lord. So we just pray and ask as we come before you if there are sins that we've been wrestling through, that we repent and surrender these things to you, that we would come to you, not be ashamed, Lord, but we know that you're a God who is loving and forgiving, but also a just God, Lord. So would you be with us tonight? Would the songs that we sing be from our hearts and would our study be fruitful and that we learn more about you? So we thank you, Lord, and pray all this in your name. Amen.

I have heard that some of the ladies, it's a little scary to walk to your car after the Bible study, especially if you've parked far away. So brothers, if you guys can, the request would be, if you guys get here, can you guys park far away? (audience laughing) In consideration of our sisters, I mean, realistically, there are a lot of shenanigans happening in this area when it goes dark. And so just for the sake of peace of mind for our ladies, if you guys do happen to come early or on time, try not to park here. Let's leave these for the ladies. And then guys, if you guys can park at the farther away lots. Sound okay? (audience cheering) Because I have heard that the ladies, sometimes it's kind of scary when you're having to walk far away by yourself. So either we assign every lady walking out a dude to walk with her, (audience laughing) or you just park farther away. All right? Now let me pray for us. (audience laughing) Let me pray for us, and then we'll just go into our teaching section. Father, this section of scripture is not the easiest to understand, and at the same time, we can understand lots of it just intuitively. We pray that as we spend a little time making observations together, that your living and active word really would sharpen our thinking, it would convict us, and it would cause us to make the appropriate application. So I pray for your help, that you would help us just to learn your truth, your interpretation, and your way, so that we would submit to it appropriately without confusion. So we thank you, Lord, for your holy word. We pray for a blessed and protected time, and we ask these things in Jesus' name. So when I break this up just visually, this is how I would do it, okay? And there's a few things that I'm sure you guys have already noticed, okay? There are two very important words, now and for. You guys pick that up already? Okay, now, John is saying, "Okay, I have an exhortation to give you." And then the for is introducing a context. This is what I want you to do, and here's why. Because the for actually can be translated because. All right? And if I just scan my eye through this thing, the word walking and walk is used often. The word commandment is used often. It's interesting that one of them is commandments, plural. You guys notice that? Okay, so then naturally an inductive question that you would have in your head is like, "What commandment or ss are, is he referring to?" And a lot of times in scripture, if there is something that's not really clear in our heads, we're actually very reluctant to obey it, right? So that's why it helps to try to discern what does he mean by commandment, okay? And then the main exhortation here is not an imperative, but it's love one another. But as I'm looking at this, it's very logically strange that there's all these false prophets and antichrists and deceivers, but my job is to love one another? So that is a logical jump, right? So I would actually ask that, like, "What does that mean?" Okay? So I just do this so that I know with my eyeballs, like, where to go, okay? And I know that there's a relationship between love and obedience to God's commandment here. You guys notice that? And now I just have to piece those two together, love and an obedience to God's commands, okay? So here are the two, the little clumps, and I included verse seven in today's section so that you already have kind of a heads up for next week's passage. It's kind of the bridge verse, but verses four through six, it's referring to just the life and the health of a Christian fellowship and the kinds of things that hurt the fellowship, okay? It's internal, all right? What are we supposed to do as a church, focus on as a church? What are the wheat supposed to be applying here? And then the next week's passage, the middle part, the second half of the middle part, are the threat of doctrinal dangers. So that's a unique juxtaposition of, you need to love one another and be a healthy community, but the opposition is false teaching. So that's a weird juxtaposition logically, okay? And then next week we're actually looking at the tares. So I'm looking at the life of the Christian fellowship, the internal, the wheat, and then the threat of doctrinal dangers, the external and the tares, okay? And I looked at this, and I'm gonna take a moment to, okay, there's a lot of walk, all right? It sounds really nice. It's worthy to put on a frame, walk in love. But in my mind, I actually don't know what that is. Walk in truth. So what exactly is that? And if I don't know what exactly it looks like, it's difficult to apply. So I'm gonna take a little bit of time to just walk through what walk means, okay? So in the New Testament, walk is a new, it's a metaphor for the Christian life. I mean, I'm not sure if it necessarily comes from Micah 6.8. He is showing you, oh man, what is good? What does the Lord require of you? To love just, or to do justice, to love mercy, and what? Walk humbly. Genesis 5.24, Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him. So what does walk mean in the New Testament? It just means live a Christian life. And these are just quotes. Walk in newness of life, Romans 6.4. We walk by faith, not by sight. I say walk by the Spirit, and you will not desire, or gratify the desires of the flesh. Galatians 5. Walking in good works, walking in wisdom, walking in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Walk in the same manner as Jesus walked. So this is a metaphor for abide, or live the Christian life. Okay? So my mind is gonna come up with some very key inductive questions when I look through this passage. What's the relationship between the presence of deceivers and the Antichrist and the believer's need to walking in truth and love? So, I mean, that's a mouthful, but that's an important question. What does that have to do with each other? The second question is what is meant by the commandment, or commandments? Okay? Because the word commandment is a very important word. It's like, okay, it means there's an expectation that God wants me to obey something. So what is that? What is love? Okay, what is the biblical definition of love? And you might have like four or five verses like rolling around in your head, but what is this--and what is John talking about? The apostle of love, that's what he's called. What is he referring to? And then who or what is the Antichrist? Okay? Now, I just want to take a moment to do a little review. Exegesis is the process of drawing out the meaning from Scripture in accordance with the context and the discoverable meaning of its author. So if the Bible is the word of God, my opinion of it doesn't matter. If the Bible is indeed the word of God, there's only one interpretation. True or false? Yeah, there's only one. Our job is to try to discern God's interpretation because that's the correct one. Not Tim Keller, not John Piper, not John MacArthur, not Pastor Peter, not Pastor Mark, not Pastor Nate. One interpretation, what is that? Okay? So we try to exegete the meaning from the Scriptures and discern God's will for our lives. And exegesis is the process by which we put meaning into the text. Okay? So the questions that I had previously, I want to answer these biblically. Okay? And 2 John in and of itself may not give me all my answers, and that's okay. Okay? But I want to answer these exegetically and biblically rather than put my meaning into the text. So what I want to do with this passage to those questions is, okay, what does the whole of 2 John have to say? We're looking at four verses today, but in total there's 13. And then perhaps if I don't get enough of my answers, what does the apostle John have to say in all of his writings, either directly or indirectly? In John's writings, they're not complicated. He's a fisherman. Okay? I'm not going to knock on blue-collar fishermen, but his writing is simple. So what does he have to say in the totality of his writings? And then if I need additional information, what do the other epistles have to say? And then what does the whole Bible have to say about things like truth and love, commandments, deceivers, antichrists? If we eisegit, we're going to put our understanding and definition of love into the passage. For example, have you heard the statement, "Love is love"? What is that? Right? But if someone is coming from a paradigm where, oh, everything is all about love, love is love, then you're going to put that into the text, and you're going to come up with a definition that might not be exact or accurate to the Scriptures. Also, if I'm eisegiting, I might think of commandments as a legalistic thing. Oh, isn't it all about grace? Like, why is he talking about commandments four times? Oh, this is bad. This is not like the heart of God because the heart of God wants us to be free. Why is he putting extra commandments on us? That's eisegiting. Also, if you guys have done like end times stuff, you're looking into like movies of like "The Rapture," and there's a movie called "The Omen." I watched it in the early '80s. Freaked me out. It was a movie in 1976 about like the Antichrist. But if I'm reading this, I might already infuse my understanding of the Antichrist as depicted by Hollywood into this text. I don't want to do that. So what I want to do is try to understand biblically, because there is only one interpretation that's correct, and that's God's. I'm going to look at 2 John. I'm going to look at all of what Apostle John has to say, what do the other epistles have to say, and then what does the whole Bible have to say. And that's the process that I'm going to make observations by. And you guys should be, for the most part, familiar with this. So there are satanic deceivers, and I'm going to just refer to John. And John is very black and white with everything, right? But he goes, "If we say that we have fellowship in him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another. And the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us." I might take some time to look at this passage parallel to what I'm looking at today, to just come to some conclusions. But John 8, 44, Jesus is saying this to the Pharisees, people who are all about the commandments, okay? "You are of the Father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever Satan, the devil, speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies." So this is who we are up against. And he has a lot of followers, a lot of minions, knowing and unknowing, conscious and subconscious, that have been sent out into the world. Okay? Hopefully you're tracking. So I'm going to be looking at this, trying to understand John's theology of deceivers and liars and what he has to say about Satan. Okay? And then I'll look at other passages in the Scriptures. "The Lord God commanded the man, saying, 'From any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.'" But just one chapter later, the serpent says to the woman, "Oh, you surely will not die." Okay? Liar. "For such men," 2 Corinthians 11, 13-14, "are false prophets, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light." Now, what I'm looking at, for many deceivers have gone out into the world, and there, there's a heresy, right? They deny that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. And the way I look at this is like, okay, I have a formidable foe. Okay? Who is the father of lies. He is a deceiver. What am I supposed to do? Okay? And I'm going to show you how easily you guys can be deceived. All right? So, in your minds, I'm going to give you a riddle, and just picture it with me. If you know the answer, you don't need to blurt it out. Okay? Think of a man at home. Okay? And he starts at home, and he jogs a little bit. And then at the corner, he decides to make a left. He's running. And then at the next corner, he decides to make a left. And then he turns the next corner, and he's jogging, and he makes another left, and then he's looking at home. Okay? So he's jogging a little bit more. But when he gets home, there are two men there waiting for him. They've got masks on. Do you have a picture in your head? A man leaves home running. He jogs a little bit, makes a left. He jogs a little bit, makes a left. He jogs a little bit, makes a left, and upon his return home, there are two men waiting for him, and they both have masks on. Why is the man running? Who are the two men? I told you the exact same story, minus some details. I did not lie. But I tricked you. How many of you were tricked legitimately? Okay, some of you guys are like, "Oh, I knew this one. Cheaters." You don't think Satan does that? He also deceives by not explaining the whole truth. That's the foe that we're against. You guys tracking? Most deceptions are based on mostly truths. Rat poison is 2% poison, 98% food. And that's why it's so important for the Christian to be discerning, because Satan does not rest. But then when you're looking at this passage, you're like, "Okay, deceiver and the Antichrist, and if I'm looking through the Scriptures, man, this is scary stuff." But we're actually also called in the Scriptures not to be fearful. So here's another John series of texts. "But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own initiative, but whatever he hears, he will speak, and he will disclose to you what is to come." John 17, 15 to 17. "I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." So John, one of his favorite subjects to talk about is truth. And the Spirit of God will lead us, if you're a child of God and you have the Spirit of God dwelling within you, into all truth. So when I'm looking at these questions, I'm looking through, like, "Okay, what does this passage have to say about this?" I might have to dig a little bit more in other passages. And that's what I just did when it comes to deceiver, etc., etc. Now here's the question. What is the commandment? How many of you guys have thought that? Like, what is this commandment? Is it like "the" commandment, or is it commandments, plural? Is it like just the Bible? Is it like, what is this commandment? Is it to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself? Like, what is that exactly? So there is no way to actually discern what specific commandment John is talking about. But generally speaking, he's referring to basically adherence to the Word of God and all of the Word of God. And you know in Matthew 28, the Great Commission, "Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to do what? All that I commanded you." So, it could be 1 John 3, 23-24-ish things. This is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us. The one who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. We know by this that he abides in us by the Spirit whom he has given us. That's a verse worthy of meditation. Okay? Romans 13, 9-10, this is what Paul's indirect definition is. "For this, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet. And if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor, therefore love is the fulfillment of the law." But then, if I'm a progressive liberal, I'm looking at Romans 13, 10, and I might have a different definition. So, for us, love is the fulfillment of the law. Great. Then what is love? Then I would have to go there. Right? John, this is Jesus saying, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments." "Why do you call me Lord, Lord? Do not do what I say. Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you what he is like." And he's like a wise man who built his house on the rock. That's Matthew 7, found in Luke. Matthew 7, 15-16, "Beware the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them. Grapes are not gathered from the thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?" So this is a related passage to today's study. Titus 1-16, we looked at this a few terms ago. "They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed." So when I'm looking through this passage, and I'm trying to find clear definitions to vaguer terms, this is the process I'll take. Because in 2 John, it's hard to piece it all together just from 2 John. Would you guys agree? There's deceivers, there's antichrists, and I need to love, and there's commandments, but how are they all connected? That's the process that I would take. But here is the relationship between fighting off bad doctrine to discernment. "But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil." So here's a take-home point. Holy living will produce godly discernment. Amen? Holy living will produce godly discernment. But the problem is, when we are dabbling in sins, and if we're entangled in stuff, our judgment gets all crazy, wrong. And then we're quicker to justify things, defend things, excuse things, and our thinking is compromised. But holy living is something that we train ourselves for. It produces godly discernment. So I'm going to go back to our passage. "I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father. Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another." Because that's the will of God. Right? John 13, 34, 35, "By this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another." Verse 6, "And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments." This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. Why? "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-Christ." So basically, big picture, there is satanic opposition in your midst. He's been a liar from the beginning. He's been a murderer from the beginning. He distorts everything. So, the Christian needs to walk in obedience to all of God's commands, have his senses trained to discern both good and evil, and ultimately, love. For that is the will of God. So that's the big picture. These other questions, we can just go through different passages in John's letters and writings and come to conclusions like that. If you're thinking, like, what is the anti-Christ? In 1 John 2, 18, he uses the word anti-Christ in the plural as well. So it's not necessarily like the man of lawlessness that we see in 2 Thessalonians. So just know that that word just means opposition to Christ. All right? I mean, that was just a wrap-up, but for next week, we're looking at the latter part of 2 John. And then, I mean, you want to mostly focus on 8 through 11, verses 12 and 13 is just, I don't want to write on paper and pen. Just, I'll talk to you face-to-face, right? Bless you. But 8 through 11 is kind of the meat. Okay? So prepare that. And for today, my encouragement is to really discuss these things. Number one, in what ways does your areas -- do your areas -- that's so annoying -- do your areas of entanglements and/or disobedience obstruct you love for other people? Okay? I hate this. There's a little OCD in me. But you understand, right? There's a correlation between my willingness to obey God and the love that I have for people. My disobedience to the will of God makes me naturally selfish. So in what ways? Secondly, in what practical ways can you grow in your knowledge of the commandments, plural, of God? Third, what do you perceive to be the deceptions and the antichrists around you? How do you combat those things? And then fourthly, how can your group members pray specifically for your spiritual growth? In what ways can they keep you accountable? And in these discussions, the more specific your answer is, the more beneficial for the whole. Vulnerability breeds vulnerability. Humility breeds humility. So share and keep each other truly accountable rather than just sharing in vague terms. Okay? So let me pray for us and then we'll go into our discussion. Father, we trust you and we know that your word is powerful. So help us to feed off it. And as we feed off it, train us to help others to feed off it as well. Would you bless our discussions? Allow them to be fruitful. I pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
