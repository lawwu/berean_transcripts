take to bring them back into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=95s">00:01:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the community.</span></div><div

passages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=104s">00:01:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, one of the things that really stood out to me is in 2 Timothy, 1 and 2 Timothy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=108s">00:01:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">he starts a letter by saying, "Grace, mercy, and peace."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=112s">00:01:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">John used that same introduction, "Grace, mercy, and peace."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=116s">00:01:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In other parts, Paul introduces the letters by saying, "Grace and peace to you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=120s">00:02:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But in those three particular letters, it says, "Grace, mercy, and peace."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=124s">00:02:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And even this morning I was meditating on that, you know, like grace and peace is typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=129s">00:02:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what we understand the gospel to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=132s">00:02:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jews spent, you know, hundreds of years like introducing themselves and seeking the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=136s">00:02:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">peace of God, shalom of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=139s">00:02:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Christ comes and He brings this peace, not by the law, but by grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=144s">00:02:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But the addition of the word mercy, you know, I think it's crucial that if we're never at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=151s">00:02:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a point where we require God's mercy, we won't really understand His grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=158s">00:02:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning, if we've never been desperate to overcome our sin, if we've never been desperate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=164s">00:02:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">because you see the depth of our sin and it's completely beyond our help, if we've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=171s">00:02:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">come to that point, grace is just going to feel like a Christmas gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=177s">00:02:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You didn't deserve it, you didn't earn it, but somebody gave it to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=181s">00:03:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get that every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=184s">00:03:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody is gracious to us and they give us something we didn't deserve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=187s">00:03:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But the grace that Christ points to is much deeper than just a Christmas gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=194s">00:03:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Just He gave you a gift that you didn't deserve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=196s">00:03:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the whole point of the Mosaic Law was to bring us to a point where we were desperate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=202s">00:03:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=203s">00:03:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=204s">00:03:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the whole point of chapter 13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=206s">00:03:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine if you or somebody you knew was diagnosed with this skin disease, how devastating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=213s">00:03:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">news would have been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=214s">00:03:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that person was sent out of the gate and he couldn't even be around you, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=220s">00:03:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were around him, you would become unclean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=222s">00:03:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So as soon as he was diagnosed, it was no different than being diagnosed for death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=226s">00:03:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if you consider what chapter 13 says, it would have been easier to just die than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=232s">00:03:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to go outside of the camp and live the way a leopard would have had to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=236s">00:03:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 14 brings us, once the devastating news has been given, chapter 14 brings us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=243s">00:04:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to the restoration of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=245s">00:04:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it's a clear presentation of where the Mosaic Law brings us to recognize the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=251s">00:04:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">depth of our sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=253s">00:04:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when the gospel comes, when we say that Christ saved us by His grace, that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=258s">00:04:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy, again, not just simply a Christmas gift, something that we didn't deserve, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=264s">00:04:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">how does somebody live when you are a recipient of mercy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=270s">00:04:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to be talking about that later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=272s">00:04:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, again, the challenge that we have in living our Christian lives, and especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=278s">00:04:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">if you've been a Christian for a while, that we know it's grace mentally, but maybe we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=285s">00:04:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">have a tendency to drift from what it is that we've really been saved from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=290s">00:04:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so therefore, the response that we give to God becomes just a routine thing that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=296s">00:04:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=298s">00:04:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is not a celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=299s">00:04:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Our worship is not a celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=301s">00:05:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not a thanking and running to Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=305s">00:05:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, chapter 13 and 14, again, is a clear message of what God had embedded into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=311s">00:05:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel message about the condemnation of sin and what it looks like to be delivered from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=316s">00:05:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=317s">00:05:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's chapter 13 and chapter 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=319s">00:05:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">God prescribed no treatment for the cure of leprosy here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=323s">00:05:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So He's not describing in chapter 14, this is how to cure this man or a woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=329s">00:05:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we see in chapter 14 is how to recognize when God healed this person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=336s">00:05:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So He's not doing anything to cure him.</span></div><div class="c"><span

medicine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=342s">00:05:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/269807551#t=348s">00:05:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the affected individual was at the mercy of God to heal him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
