href="https://www.vimeo.com/737364128#t=125s">00:02:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the problem that that cliche addresses is, because we are living in a post-Christian</span></div><div

think the number is a bit less than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/737364128#t=159s">00:02:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that now, but back in the

is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/737364128#t=220s">00:03:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/737364128#t=221s">00:03:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the definition of religion is a set of doctrine or rules that distinguishes that</span></div><div
