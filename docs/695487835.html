Matthew 16, 13 to 16, and then I'll read verse 21.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835&t=65">00:01:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now when Jesus

eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835&t=548">00:09:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to Bethany and then to Jerusalem and then to the
