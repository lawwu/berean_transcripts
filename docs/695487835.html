<span class="t">When Jesus asks this question, it happens right after Jesus feeds the 5,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

5,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=439s">00:07:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is the number of men that were there, if you count the women

miracle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=449s">00:07:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that Jesus performed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=451s">00:07:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as a result of that, many of them said they wanted to forcefully make Him king.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=456s">00:07:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He must be the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=462s">00:07:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you would know who I am."</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=490s">00:08:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesus says, "I am the bread of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=505s">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">disciples stopped following Him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=507s">00:08:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so typically when we think of Jesus' rejection, we think of Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=511s">00:08:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He's riding on the donkey, He's headed toward the cross and say, "Crucify Him, crucify Him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=516s">00:08:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But the public rejection of Jesus actually happened right after the feeding of the 5,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=522s">00:08:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So as soon as that happened, Jesus begins to pay, turn His attention toward His disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=527s">00:08:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So He takes Him up to the upper part of Galilee in Capernaum and He begins to prepare His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=534s">00:08:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=536s">00:08:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And after Peter makes this confession, He begins to slowly, if you look at the timeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=541s">00:09:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the geography, Jesus begins to slowly move down Galilee to Samaria and then eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=548s">00:09:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to Bethany and then to Jerusalem and then to the cross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=552s">00:09:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So when He's asking this question, He already has His mind set to begin to move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=558s">00:09:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why after the confession in verse 21, it says, "From that time, Jesus began to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=563s">00:09:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">His disciples that

when the disciples finally truly understood who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/695487835#t=572s">00:09:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">He
