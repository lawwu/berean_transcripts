At the age of six, a cyst on my liver determined my life or death. My mom shared about her father in heaven and his son Jesus Christ who died for my sins. The day I was discharged from the hospital was Easter Sunday and was celebrated that day as starting new life that God conquered my death. But the surgery scar on my abdomen meant strict dietary guidelines, meaning there were certain food or snacks like candy that I was not allowed to consume. Lack of certain snacks and food led to stealing which then escalated to other things throughout the years. From elementary to high school, I was aware of my wrongful actions but I was far from repentance. Over the years, I became so consumed with stealing from friends, families, Old Navy, a place that used to exist called Mervin's, Albertsons, and Target, calling this hobby my job. Not only was I deliberately committing sin, there was so much more rooted underneath. My stealing even continued within the church which caused strife among the elders and when being confronted rather than being honest about my wrongdoings, I chose to lie instead. Shortly after, my parents who owned a small business went bankrupt which led me to feel guilty of my wrongdoings. Only out of fear of man, I questioned if my parents' bankruptcy was because of my actions. But I still refused to confess and repent. With a new start and a new state, I was asked a common question for a new person, "So why did you and your family move?" To avoid telling the truth, I lied and kept distance from people. Ultimately, this led to loneliness which then led to dark thoughts. But by the grace of God who has shown mercy in my time of trouble, the Holy Spirit revealed to me that loneliness is God's way to intervene and say, "Hey, I am here. Talk to me." During that time of devotion, I confessed of my sin of stealing and asked for repentance. It was sophomore year in college where there was a change in my mind and in my heart of completely cutting ties with stealing. The Holy Spirit also revealed to me through many Sunday sermons of my other deeply rooted sins of pride, gluttony, envy, and greed which outcomes my anger and fear. God also revealed my idolization in the opinions of others and how much I feared man than fearing God the creator. In all my wrongdoings, God continues to keep his promise of loving me by sacrificing his son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty of my sins. Understanding this and clinging onto it became a healing process in my sanctification journey. There is joy and freedom from the torment of sin and that I am reminded that I have been given grace when I do not deserve it. It was freely given to me. In Hebrews 11, one says this, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." I will trust and cling onto his word to practice obedience while at the same time having faith in the work of Jesus Christ in order to seek God's kingdom. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
