href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=80s">00:01:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously there's some questions there, but it's pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=83s">00:01:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are literal churches that existed historically or some backgrounds, or he's talking to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=89s">00:01:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something that we know tangibly existed.</span></div><div

thinking about chapter four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=100s">00:01:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=102s">00:01:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All the different visions that are come up, like where does it apply?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=104s">00:01:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=106s">00:01:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so before we get into it, just as an encouragement, I found that, you know, studying through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=114s">00:01:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible, obviously there are certain books that are much harder to understand than other books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=119s">00:01:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Leviticus is one of those books, Numbers, Ezekiel, Lamentations, some parts of Daniel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=125s">00:02:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and Book of Revelation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=126s">00:02:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I found that some of the most rewarding studies are always in these books and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=132s">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">simply because you find some new things that you didn't know before, but it'll force you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=138s">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to try to connect the dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=141s">00:02:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll force you to look at other passages that are difficult places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=144s">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it will help you to understand how these things are connected to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=150s">00:02:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So oftentimes you can study the Book of Ephesians and never study any other book but Ephesians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=156s">00:02:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So of course you can gain a lot from that, but these prophetic books, it really wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=161s">00:02:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ever meant to be studied in isolation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=164s">00:02:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to study parts of Ezekiel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=166s">00:02:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to study parts of Daniel, parts of Isaiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=169s">00:02:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it helps us to connect the dots so that we can get a broader understanding of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=175s">00:02:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what God is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=177s">00:02:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know that God's salvation history, that it's preparation for Christ and then the rest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=185s">00:03:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of human history from New Testament, the Gospels and on, it kind of points us back to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=191s">00:03:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But the specifics of how it's going to be revealed, the specifics of how all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=195s">00:03:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things are going to unravel, in particular in history, this is where these prophetic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=203s">00:03:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">books, apocalyptic books come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=205s">00:03:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of makes things that were kind of, again, it's not crystal clear, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=212s">00:03:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of gives you a much clearer picture of the application of how this is going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=218s">00:03:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it forces us to see the Bible in a completely different light that we may not normally look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=223s">00:03:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the benefit of studying something like a book like this, where even if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=227s">00:03:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">come out saying like, "Oh, I'm still confused," the benefit of it is you'll understand the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=231s">00:03:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible a lot better than if you haven't done the homework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=235s">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=236s">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so we're looking at chapter four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=238s">00:03:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And chapter four actually is a new section that's going to open up and prepare us for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=244s">00:04:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what's coming in chapter six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=246s">00:04:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter six and on, there are a series of seven different judgments that are coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=252s">00:04:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the trumpet, the seal judgment, and there's the bowl judgment, and then what did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=259s">00:04:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I miss?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=260s">00:04:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'll get to that in a minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=263s">00:04:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a series of seven different, three sets of seven judgments that are coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=268s">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we're going to be looking at in chapter four and five is preparation for those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=274s">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">judgments that's going to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=275s">00:04:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where all the stuff of the white horse and black horse and authority of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=279s">00:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">heavens being wiped away, that's that section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=283s">00:04:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That section between chapter six and 16 is where the heavy prophecies are going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=290s">00:04:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and say, "Oh, I don't understand this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=291s">00:04:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're going to hopefully get into that and dig into that a little bit further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=295s">00:04:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But chapter four is the beginning of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=301s">00:05:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so chapter four and five, they record seven different scenes just in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=317s">00:05:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">two chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=318s">00:05:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say seven different scenes, just kind of imagine if you were trying to do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=321s">00:05:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">skit of these two chapters, you have to have seven different things that you have to present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=329s">00:05:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so chapter four will present two of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=332s">00:05:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And in chapter five, we will see five separate scenes, separate things that he sees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=336s">00:05:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to break it up into these seven scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=338s">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Today we're going to be dealing with two of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=341s">00:05:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The seven of them, we don't have to go through all of them, but today we're going to be going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=344s">00:05:44.880</a></span> | <span

class="t">And these are all things that it says that it must happen before the other judgments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=354s">00:05:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=355s">00:05:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to see the vision of the throne of God and the description of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=360s">00:06:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the seal scrolls, and then the worthy lamb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=364s">00:06:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll get to that when we get to chapter five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=366s">00:06:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But today we're going to be dealing with one and two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=370s">00:06:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The previous section that we looked at, chapter one, two, and three, it mainly dealt with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=375s">00:06:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what was happening on earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=378s">00:06:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Today's section and then the section on, it's the door to heaven is opened up and John is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=384s">00:06:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">given a glimpse to reveal what's happening in heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=388s">00:06:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So completely flipped where we've been studying what God was seeing on earth, and

href="https://www.vimeo.com/220393110#t=619s">00:10:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is used for the purpose of gaining attention typically in times of war or to gather the</span></div><div
