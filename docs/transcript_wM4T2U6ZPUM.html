Let me get to a few announcements before we get started. Our Thanksgiving outreach dinner is happening on November 16th. Is that this Saturday? Is that this Saturday? Yeah, so it's happening this Saturday. So if you have a co-worker or somebody that you want to bring to hear a clear presentation of the gospel and meet some of our outreach team members, the sign-up is still taking place.</p><p>It's going to be happening at the cafe at 6 p.m. this coming Saturday. Cleaning and Maintenance Day is scheduled for November 23rd, and so the logistics team is asking me to give it a little push. So if some of you guys who are able to come to that, we are in need of more people.</p><p>So please sign up for that, and the sign-up will be outside. Regional Thanksgiving dinner, if you are planning to participate or if you already signed up and you didn't get an email, you should have gotten an email. So please email Justin and let him know that you didn't get an email so he can make sure that your name is added to that.</p><p>And if you haven't signed up but you're planning to, please do so as soon as possible like today because the assignments have already gone out and there's only a few places where there's room, and so if you end up signing any later than today, you're going to end up getting assigned somewhere kind of different than where you're living.</p><p>So please sign up as soon as possible if you are able to come. Finally, actually two more, Living Well Pregnancy Center baby bottle drive. This is for the Living Well Pregnancy Center. They're collecting the -- I think those of you who were here last year, they were able to do that.</p><p>You fill it up with coins and then they turn it in and they said there's about three weeks left to do that, so if you want to participate, go outside, visit the table, and they'll give you a bottle to be able to do that. And then finally, Family Ministry Christmas Party happening on December 7th at 5 p.m.</p><p>The cost of it is $15 for adults and I think five for children, and there is babysitting provided that day, so please go outside and then when you go to the table, sign-up table, you can sign up as soon as you go out. I think the table that you run into is where the sign-up is happening.</p><p>All right, I think that's it for the announcements. Let me pray for us and if you have a physical offering, please visit the offering in the back as you're going out. All right, let's pray. Father, we thank you for your mercies. We thank you for the love that you pour upon us that we do not deserve.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes to you, that our love, our adoration, our worship, Lord God, will be an overflow of your mercies in our lives. I pray that this time will be an opportunity for us to fix our eyes upon Christ, help us to learn from him, to know him, celebrate him, and to worship him.</p><p>And may our offering be a reflection of that worship and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
