whether it's from your family,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299633634#t=3106s">00:51:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or something happened to you, or somebody did something to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299633634#t=3109s">00:51:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe something you did, that you have a hard time forgiving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299633634#t=3114s">00:51:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a hard time letting go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299633634#t=3117s">00:51:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of that because we live under the umbrella of living under the fallen world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299633634#t=3122s">00:52:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of that will be restored by the
