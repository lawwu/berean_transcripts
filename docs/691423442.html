was by my father, but I was in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=243s">00:04:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">my 20s.</span></div><div

exactly the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=252s">00:04:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">same age as I am now when he wrote this

didn't see when I was in my 20s</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=259s">00:04:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because now I can kind of understand the perspective that he's coming from because we're at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=264s">00:04:24.280</a></span> | <span

one of the chapters was really interesting to me and I actually already mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=271s">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to some of the pastors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=273s">00:04:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that he mentioned was that how much he didn't like uniforms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=277s">00:04:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and back in Korea in 1950s, you don't question leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=282s">00:04:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you

kind of go with the flow type of guy, but he said how he protested wearing uniforms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=290s">00:04:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reasoning why he gave was how the uniforms don't give freedom for people to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=295s">00:04:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of express themselves and really grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=297s">00:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The uniformity is beneficial to the people who are in authority, but for the regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=304s">00:05:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people to be able to really, you know, to grow the way that God had created them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=309s">00:05:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I was interested in that is because that's always kind of been my own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=312s">00:05:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophy.</span></div><div

them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=317s">00:05:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to be, but I want them to kind of express, you know, even if they struggle, even if they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=321s">00:05:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stray, that it's their own faith that they're expressing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=325s">00:05:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so I've always kind of been hands off in specifically what they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=329s">00:05:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of how even the ministry philosophy, I don't like seeing just uniformity, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=334s">00:05:34.880</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=341s">00:05:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it was interesting to me because, you know, if I didn't read it, I would have</span></div><div

presentation of Christ and what he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=472s">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was going to

this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=477s">00:07:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the text that we're looking at in chapter 40 is a transition from God's indictment into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=482s">00:08:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the promise that he's making

indictment against Israel, the historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=497s">00:08:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">background behind that

the Assyrians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=505s">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the Southern Kingdom has been kind of moving along, but they were also in danger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=510s">00:08:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because the Assyrians have

King Hezekiah, who was a good king, had an idea that if he aligned himself with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=521s">00:08:41.400</a></span> |

started to become chummy with the Babylonians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=527s">00:08:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And when, as he started building this relationship, he basically opened up the temple and showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=533s">00:08:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of his inner courts and everything that they had, hoping that somehow if they aligned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=544s">00:09:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now obviously this very much displeased God because God wanted them, the whole point of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=550s">00:09:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel's history is so that God

king, even Hezekiah, started to drift thinking that if they had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691423442#t=559s">00:09:19.120</a></span> | <span
