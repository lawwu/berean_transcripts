these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=413s">00:06:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things are going to lead us to the day of atonement,

and then from that it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=420s">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to go beyond and talk about how to

the laws of purity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=431s">00:07:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the previous chapter 10, 10 and 11, so if you have your Bibles open just turn there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=436s">00:07:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">real quick, 10 and 11 God says to the priests, you are to distinguish between holy and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=445s">00:07:25.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=449s">00:07:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The priest through God's law were to identify what is acceptable, what is not acceptable</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=455s">00:07:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 11 through 15 is identifying for us what they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=462s">00:07:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 11 is talking about what is clean and unclean in animals and then chapter 12</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=467s">00:07:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through 15 is unclean and clean pertaining to human beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=475s">00:07:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were to split up chapter 11 through 15 that's how it would be split up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=478s">00:07:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So starting from next week's chapter 12 we're going to get into specifics of how God views</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=482s">00:08:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">clean and unclean as it pertains

animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=494s">00:08:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the previous chapters deal with the ritual dealings with worship at the tabernacle but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=501s">00:08:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this passage in particular, chapter 11 through 15 is how these laws should be practiced at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=507s">00:08:27.920</a></span> | <span

tabernacle and the priesthood and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=513s">00:08:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">purification and their washing and their ordination but starting from this point on it's specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=519s">00:08:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=521s">00:08:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So these aren't necessarily things that are practiced only in the tabernacle but in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=524s">00:08:44.720</a></span> | <span

distinction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=528s">00:08:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So in chapter 11, 32 separate times the word unclean is used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=537s">00:08:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The word unclean is used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=538s">00:08:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can already tell just by the repetition of this word that that's the theme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=543s">00:09:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What is unclean before God's eyes and then it uses the word detestable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=549s">00:09:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of your translations abomination, 11 separate times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=554s">00:09:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So some things are unclean, some things are abominable, they're detestable before God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=559s">00:09:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're not to touch it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=562s">00:09:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now these distinctions between clean and unclean animals are not new in Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=568s">00:09:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember we talked about that, a lot of the sacrifices, these burnt offerings, remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=572s">00:09:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we saw it even in the book of Genesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=575s">00:09:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's most likely the offering that maybe that Cain and Abel or Abel offered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=581s">00:09:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It seemed like it was a burnt

sacrificial systems and what is considered clean and unclean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/264917839#t=593s">00:09:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it existed but in chapter in the book of Leviticus it's clarifying it and make it into a law,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
