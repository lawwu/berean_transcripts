class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=83s">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there would be a group of guys probably about my age,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=87s">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're all businessmen, so they didn't have a 95 job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=90s">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so they were able to hang out for about an hour or two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=92s">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we started playing basketball.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=94s">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Initially, it was awkward when they found out that I was a pastor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=97s">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and so we always go through that awkward stage like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">am I going to get judged if I say something wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=102s">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we passed that period, and we spent enough time together where we literally started to become friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=109s">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we started joking around with one another,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=111s">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they started feeling comfortable enough with me where they just started being themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=117s">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that I noticed was, one, these guys are all athletic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=120s">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so it was clear that they were jocks when they were younger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=123s">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you could tell on the basketball court they were pretty athletic even at that age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=128s">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But another thing that I saw was they were living their glory days on the basketball court,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=134s">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and so we couldn't play basketball for more than 15 minutes straight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=137s">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because every time a young pretty girl would walk upstairs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they would sit there and gawk at that girl and talking about, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=144s">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like when they were younger, they used to do this and they used to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I felt comfortable enough to just mock them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, none of those girls are interested in you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=154s">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you're wasting your time.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=158s">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would have to kind of bring them back, and we would play basketball for a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=162s">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and every 15 minutes, they would go back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=164s">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized that these guys were all big men on campus when they were younger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=169s">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were the athletic jocks, maybe the quarterback of their team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=174s">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were living their glory days, you know, and they were on the court,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=178s">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and every chance that they got, they would talk about, you know, how they played basketball</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or how they played football when they were younger and how they used to date so many girls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=187s">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, again, it's annoying, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=191s">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I mean by childishness, that they should have matured beyond that by now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=195s">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're always looking back and saying, "Man, when I was younger, when I was in high school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was in college."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=203s">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The sad thing is many Christians know exactly what I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=208s">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we talk about our spiritual maturity, it always goes back to, "Man, when I was in college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=214s">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when I used to be a part of this campus meeting, when I used to lead this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=217s">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when I used to do that," and always looking back because those were the glory days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then ever since we left college, there was no growth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=227s">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're exactly where you were when you graduated, whether it was five years ago, ten years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or twenty years ago, so whenever we talk about spiritual maturity, you always think about, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the glory days back then, when I used to do this, when I used to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=240s">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine, imagine if the rest of your life, not just your spiritual part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360151042#t=247s">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but your understanding of finances, how
