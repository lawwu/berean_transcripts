and connection that when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=174s">00:02:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think about submission, you are placing yourself under, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=179s">00:02:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you realize is there is a regular pattern in our lives as Christians to diminish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=184s">00:03:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">our own significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=186s">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the scriptures literally tell us in other passages to regard others as much more important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=191s">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">than yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=192s">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the needs of others in greater priority than yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=196s">00:03:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But within that also, in the home, God has designed it that there be levels of leadership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=202s">00:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and submission within the home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=205s">00:03:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we realize from the previous passage is that the role that God has for the husband</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=211s">00:03:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is that he should reflect Christ's headship over the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=215s">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we're trying to think of conceptually, how do I envision the role of the husband,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=222s">00:03:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you should be meditating about what does it mean for Christ to be head, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=227s">00:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it mean for the husband to be head of the house?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=231s">00:03:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And all those different things, because obviously one paragraph isn't going to give you every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=236s">00:03:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">element of what that role entails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=239s">00:03:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we realize is when we get a big vision and a picture of what we are supposed to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=245s">00:04:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">then all the little steps then we can think about and apply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=248s">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea here is that the husbands have an incredibly great role to play when it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=254s">00:04:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to leadership as a husband and as father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=259s">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now what's kind of funny is when I think about the role of husband and the role of wife,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=263s">00:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think about some of the weddings that I've been to and the interesting and fun, cliche-ish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=267s">00:04:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things that people say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=269s">00:04:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard it said, you know, a husband say, "Happy wife, happy life," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=274s">00:04:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now all of that is just a little bit of just, I guess you could say idioms that we say for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=280s">00:04:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=282s">00:04:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And another thing that I've heard at weddings is there are three rings in marriage, engagement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=288s">00:04:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ring, wedding ring, and suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=291s">00:04:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, "Ha ha," and everybody laughs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=292s">00:04:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's been a little bit overplayed, so people don't say it anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=296s">00:04:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to even the husband's role and the wife's role, I heard somebody say within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=301s">00:05:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a wedding context that the husband is the head, but I am the neck that turns the head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=306s">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone, "Ha ha," you know,

funny because there's an element of the human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=313s">00:05:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">observation of life and says, "Yeah, these are kind of funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=316s">00:05:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I know they're not like life rules to live by, but they're just funny observations about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=321s">00:05:21.160</a></span> | <span

to this because today I just want to summarize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/434199669#t=327s">00:05:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this
