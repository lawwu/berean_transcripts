Lord.</p><p>and as we go about our days will we be reminded of of this love would we honor you and all that we do and tonight as we sing these songs would it not just be lip service to you but would we mean it would we worship you and praise you so we thank you lord we love you pray all this in your name you spread out the skies you spread out the skies over empty space said let there be light to

outreach volleyball day That's coming up on Saturday, October 11th Again, if you have somebody that you want to bring Again, be prayerful Please sign up for that as well And then just a reminder Lot K is not this building Our sanctuary building to the right of it Or if you're looking at it this way To the left of it Okay, so that side of the building They contacted us And they said that our church people are just parking In places where they shouldn't be parking We're going to lose that parking if we do that So actually we're still in the context of talking with them So there's designated spots where they have places Where they ask us not to park And then we found out that people are ignoring that And just parking it there So they contacted us And they're basically saying that We're not going to be able to use the parking anymore If we do that So we may have already lost it We're still kind of in the process of talking to them So please do not park there You can park there only if there's space But if you're parking where they're designated not to park But again, there's a possibility we may lose that Because they didn't tell us that we can use it So we're trying to tell them we're going to try not to But until you get further notice Make sure that you do not do that But we may have an announcement that we're not going to use that Just to give you a heads up, okay?</p><p>So that's for that lot, okay?

then this would pop up So this is all free I think this is, in my opinion This is probably one of the most useful Bible programs online So if you don't have a Bible program So if you don't have a Bible program I highly recommend you to start using it And so when you're studying it It'll make it much easier for you just to click a button And then you'll be able to compare what the notes are And various things Okay?</p><p>IntoBible.com IntoBible You can play with it And then you can actually He added Our brother Daniel Poon He added ability to be able to take notes on here So if you put notes on here So if you put notes on here And you can save it So the next time you come on Those notes will appear And you can Wherever you left off It'll start right where you left off In other programs Because it's not yours It's not personalized Every time you go You have to restart it But the And it has no advertisement It's like everything that you would want in a Bible program If you don't have one If you don't have one This is very useful Okay?</p><p>So he's always tweaking it So he sent me an email Just this week Telling me that he A bunch of things have been updated And so he's still working on some things And so I highly recommend it If you are studying If you don't have a study program To get in the habit of using this If you open this And then again Whatever notes you're taking Will pop up Okay?</p><p>Alright I'm gonna have him give you a more thorough presentation Of that Maybe at another time But I just want you guys to start using it Because the more we use it The more leverage he has To be able to contact companies And to get more stuff on there So if he's Let's say we're gonna have a different Bible program Or a different version They're gonna wanna see how much engagement he has So if he only has like three or four people using it They're not gonna be motivated to give him license But if he have like hundreds of people who are using it Then it'll help him to get more stuff on here Okay?</p><p>So Alright let me pray for us and we'll start Father help us as we study through Genesis That we would glean from it what you have planned And we pray Father for insight Help us not to turn from it to the left or to the right So we pray for focus and your attention In Jesus name we pray Amen Okay Can Elder Joe can you check on the AC Everything's on Everything's on Okay Okay How are you guys?</p><p>Good Is it warm? It's warm? Okay We're just gonna have to suck it up Okay I have no solution Maybe, maybe just Can we turn the fan on? Can we turn the fan on? Fan Fan Okay Alright Uh-uh Can we turn Sorry I didn't mean to That just came out Okay can you Can you turn the fan on?</p><p>Turn the fan on? Sorry Grace Alright Alright the first question that I want to do Is the difference between creation account of chapter 1 and chapter 2 You probably already noticed that chapter 1 was a very macro view That it gave us the universe It gave us light So basically the big picture of when it happened How it happened The order of how it happened Chapter 2 is kind of like landing the plane You get on the ground And it kind of gives us specifics of Of man's creation What the garden was like The work that they were doing So chapter 1 focuses on God Right Mainly this is what God did God said this God did that And I think we said that Just in chapter 1 God's name is mentioned over 35 times And then in chapter 2 And then in chapter 2 The main focus is on creation of man Right So man is created in chapter 1 But then we head back to chapter 2 And again he gives another account of man's creation But a bit more specific Chapter 1 emphasized the chronology of events And then chapter two, the specific focus, again, you probably noticed about man, creation of woman, and garden.</p><p>Okay, I forgot to end here. Okay. And then chapter one, 27 says God created man, bara. And if you remember, the word bara means out of nothing, right? So just like he created all the universe, everything out of nothing, he said he created man out of nothing. But then chapter two, verse seven, it comes and says he was formed, yatsar, from dirt, right?</p><p>So the importance of that is man was created just like all the other creation, and then he was distinguished how? His physical body, so we are no different than an animal physically, right? So if you don't believe in God, and that's why, you know, you have PETA saying like, oh, what's the difference between us and animals?</p><p>Because we have similar systems. So if you look at the physical making, the Bible tells us that we were made like other creatures. But what distinguishes us is he separates us, right? And then he frees his breath in us. And so the, so what makes man, man is not his flesh, is not, is not his intellect.</p><p>It's God's spirit, right? So that's, again, emphasized in chapter one, he's, man is created like any other creation. In chapter two, he comes and he forms us, and then he puts his breath in us, and then he begins to describe in what way is man different, right? Okay. In what way creation of man is different?</p><p>Man is the only creation that was created in God's image, right? And obviously, that's nothing new to us. Man was given dominion over all creation, meaning that he was in the top of the pecking order of all creation. After he created everything, he creates man to cultivate. Man was formed from dust while all the creation was created by his spoken word.</p><p>So remember in chapter one, he says, God said, and it was so. God said, and it was so, right? And then, but it will come to chapter two, he creates man, he forms, use the word form out of dust, right? And so even in the way that he created man, it's unique.</p><p>It wasn't just up here, and then he appeared. He said he formed him out of dust. And the Bible tells us what God is the potter, and we are the clay, right? So the Old Testament describes, the Bible describes us as the clay that God forms, and that's exactly how creation is described of mankind.</p><p>We were like clay, like dirt, and God formed us, right? Man and woman are created in stages. That's unique, right? All of the creation was created instantly, and everything was good, except for man, he's created, and then woman is created afterwards. And so no other part of creation are they created that way, where you have male and female.</p><p>They're created simultaneously, but only man and woman is created in stages, okay? Man is the only creation after he created said it was not good for him to be alone. Again, this is tied to the man and woman's creation, right? It was made in stage for the purpose of emphasis.</p><p>So you have to think, right? Who is this written for and why? In order to understand Genesis, you have to understand that this is not just an account of creation so that you'd have better knowledge of where you came from. Remember what we talked about last week? When this was given to the nation of Israel, it was for the purpose of describing what?</p><p>Everything in the Bible is written for what purpose? Not simply to inform. Information is necessary. But for what? Part of redemptive history, right? Why redemption was necessary. So by understanding how God created us and what the specifics are, by chapter 3, the main purpose is what? What went wrong, right?</p><p>This is how God started. This was the purpose and what it was like before sin came in. Chapter 3 is what went wrong. And then beginning chapter 4 is how are we going to fix this, right? So you have to keep that in mind, everything that you're studying. What went wrong?</p><p>And then so when he fixes it, what is he trying to fix us back to, right? So everything that went wrong, if you want to go back and see what we're supposed to get fixed back to, you have to go back to Genesis. Yes? Yeah. That's why Genesis is so important because if you see redemption as just a better life, right?</p><p>My life is hard. You know, I don't have enough money. I want to be healthy. And so you create in your own mind what you think redemption is, right? What you want. It's like a fulfillment of your desire. So even the way that we think of heaven, it's all of our coveting here that's going to come true in heaven, right?</p><p>That's not redemption. That's just like the things that we covet here, we covet because of our fallen nature. So God does not fulfill the desires of our fallen nature when we get to heaven. So if we're going to understand redemption, you have to understand what he is redeeming us from and what he is redeeming us for, right?</p><p>So all of this is a picture of what he is redeeming us for, right? So even the relationship between husband and wife, if you think about it, all human relationships that go wrong, right? Where does it stem from? The first relationship between husband and wife, right? So if mankind is going to be redeemed, he has to be reconciled to the creator, right?</p><p>But then the home has to get back into order. You can't redeem children. You can't redeem uncle. You can't redeem grandparents and any other relationship until the husband and wife relationship is redeemed. Because every other relationship stems from that relationship, right? And so when he talks about the details of the creation order and how man is created and what his purpose was and how woman was created and what her purpose was.</p><p>And then sin comes in and messes all that up and it tells us what the result of this. Now the rest of redemptive history is how we're going to get back there, right? So his companion was created from his own flesh and we're going to get to the meaning of that a little bit later.</p><p>And then he gave one restriction, not to eat of the tree, right? And only man is given any restriction, right? There's no, at least there's no record of any restriction. They didn't tell the lions that you can't go over this cliff or they didn't tell the lions that you can't eat this herb.</p><p>The only restriction was given to the man, right? So in Genesis 127, it says God created Barah, right? But in 2.7, it says God formed Yetzar. So Barah means create out of nothing and we already went to this. Physical man is no different than an animal. What distinguishes it is the spirit of God in us, right?</p><p>So our physical form was formed like any other animal. But what distinguishes us is the spirit. All right, so here's a description of the garden, right? And this is what the Bible tells us existed in the garden. There was, tree was very pleasing to the sight, right? So can you imagine?</p><p>Have you ever been to somewhere where you feel like there's no touch of human, you know, human being or never, like no human being's been there? Or have you ever been somewhere where you felt like it was so clean and pristine? Throw out some places, what do you remember?</p><p>Yes. That's the first thing I think of, Banff. Yellowstone. I haven't been there, so. Yellowstone. If you think about it, some of the most beautiful places on Earth are places where human beings haven't touched. And I felt like that when I was at Banff. And then you go to, you know, the seven wonders of the world and you go there and it's like, you know, like I've always wanted to see the Great Wall.</p><p>And then you go there and it's like, oh, it's a wall. You go to Eiffel Tower, it's like, oh, it's just a bunch of metal. It's not that impressive, right? Anyway, it says that in the Garden of Eden, God said it was pleasing in the sight. The tree had good food, right?</p><p>And then here's the two things. The tree of life was in the midst and tree of knowledge of good and evil. Now, the Bible tells us it's there. It doesn't describe to us why it's there, right? So if you do an inductive Bible study, what question would you be asking?</p><p>What is the tree of life? This is before sin came in, right? So if sin didn't enter yet and they didn't die, why is there a tree of life? When you figure it out, let me know, okay? Why is there, was there evil at the Garden of Eden before the fall?</p><p>Because everything God created, he said it was good. But then there's a tree of knowledge of good and evil in their midst. So what is that? I'll let you think about it. Okay? Why is that there? Okay. I'm going to move on. I have my theory. You want to hear my theory?</p><p>Okay. This is not, okay, remember I told you there's exegesis, systematic theology, historical theology, and philosophical theology? This is philosophical theology. Meaning that we take the text and then we ask questions. We're trying to make sense of it. It doesn't mean it's right. It doesn't mean it's wrong. It's just a thought, right?</p><p>And so my thoughts aren't clear. And I'm just going to throw it out there and you can refute me later. Tree of life. Tree of life. If you look at Romans 8, 19-22, it talks about how the creation is waiting, like longing for the sons of man to be revealed.</p><p>Meaning that creation itself has suffered decay because of man's sin. Now, it doesn't describe why it did that, how it did that, but God created the earth to, and then, in order to sustain man, right? Everything was created, and then man was created and put in there. And then, so God is sustaining it.</p><p>Man is put there to cultivate it. So man's presence in creation was necessary for creation. Creation was necessary for man, right? So I think there is some sort of a connection between us and God's creation that in our decay, right, maybe that tree, and I don't know what that tree, actually how it functioned, but maybe that tree had some sort of a function for man's sustenance.</p><p>Not that he was going to die, but God created us for that. And so because sin comes in, right, he can't continue to live because of that sin. Then it would be a sinful man who is perpetually existing. And so for that reason, he needed to be, again, it's not fully thought out, but that's, I've gone maybe like one-third of the way, okay?</p><p>Now this is where heresy comes in, when you go off tangent and you start making theology. I'm just, I'm like you, I'm just asking questions. So there seems to be some connection with man and creation that we don't fully understand, and somehow this tree of life plays a role in this, okay?</p><p>So the next question is, tree of knowledge of good and evil. Why is it tree of knowledge of good and evil? Is it simply there to test him, just to see if he's going to fail, right? Again, this is philosophical theology, I have a thought. The thought is, evil is not here yet.</p><p>I mean, it's in the form of Satan because he's fallen, but evil in and of itself is not in man yet, right? Because he hasn't fallen. Now, we all say when we're born, we sin because we're sinners, right? Because of original sin, we are born with corruption already inside of us.</p><p>So we don't simply become sinners because we sin, although that is the case, but we also sin. The first sin is because we're already sinners, right? But that's not the case at the Garden of Eden. So what does it mean to have the tree of knowledge of good and evil?</p><p>Again, don't quote me outside of this church, okay? These are just my thoughts. I think the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a lot like sex, right? If I told you that I'm going to be talking about the subject of sex, would you be bringing your small children to church?</p><p>Well, maybe to church, but not to my teaching, right? You say, oh, yeah, I mean, he's going to be talking about sex that we're not going to. Why? Why would you do that? Because sex in and of itself is not evil, right? God created sex as a necessity in order for man to be fruitful and multiply.</p><p>So within the context of obedience, within what God has created, sex was actually a necessary part of why he created Eve. But why do we cringe when we say sex? Because we know the perversion, right? That's attached to sex. Because human experience, in fact, if you look at all of creation, how much of man's sin and rebellion against God is directly related to sexual perversion, right?</p><p>But sex in and of itself is not perversion. So I think this tree of knowledge of good and evil is good and evil based upon how and what you did with it. Okay? So if they approached it with obedience, what God intended, it may have been good. It wasn't inherently evil.</p><p>But because they touched it with coveting, right? And then their eyes became open, right? And so it's kind of like a young child who, you know, you're raising them and then you want to keep them as innocent as possible, right? And because you don't want them to know. So there's things that adults do without thinking twice, but then you want to keep them as innocent as long as possible, right?</p><p>We don't want them to know good and evil. We don't want them to stay where they are, right? But obviously we know that that's not possible. And so I think this, again, this doesn't answer all your questions, but I just, out of my own curiosity of what does this tree mean?</p><p>That there's a part of my thought is that it wasn't inherently evil. It was man's touch. And so when he touched it, he became intimately, he had intimate knowledge of what was evil, right? And that's what corrupted him, right? But then that tree in and of itself, I don't think was necessarily evil.</p><p>It couldn't, you could have had, okay, let me just stop there before I start going, saying strange things, okay? If you have questions about that, you can leave them out. These are just some of the thoughts that I have. Just like you guys are studying, I have the same questions, and that's kind of where my mind went, okay?</p><p>What was the creation mandate for man? It says to be fruitful and multiply, right? Now, I want you to think about if man's, God's creation mandate is to be fruitful and multiply, what's a way of rebelling against this? Think about it. Get rid of gender, right? I mean, if you think about it, the first mandate for mankind is to be fruitful and multiply.</p><p>God creates women for the purpose of procreating, right? And the ultimate rebellion of mankind is to rebel against the very first commandment of men. There is no man. There is no female. I can switch as I want. Transgender, homosexuality. So sexual perversion is at the core of rebellion against God.</p><p>It says to have stewardship, subdue the earth, and rule as God's representative. That we are to be the image bearers of God. We are to work to cultivate creation. And again, you know, if you go to the book of Proverbs, how much wisdom is talked about laziness, a man who doesn't want to work, right?</p><p>Obedience, live under God's authority, respecting his boundaries, community, fulfill the mandate together in relationship. So if you look at the core of why he created mankind, human beings are in rebellion against every single one of these. Sin comes in, breaks up the community, what God has desired, they live in disobedience, and a dream of mankind is to get enough money so they don't have to work, right?</p><p>Rewardship is not acknowledging that this belongs to God, self-possession, and then fruitfulness, like we can't, we won't, we, you know, get rid of fruitfulness. If you look at these societies, right, that have money, what happens to a culture that values material possession more than anything else? What's happening right now in the Asian countries, people don't want to get married, they don't want to have kids, because they want to have what they covet.</p><p>And so in doing so, right, get rid of gender, male and women role, covet the things of this world, and all of a sudden, human being is self-destructing, because he is not applying God's mandate, right? If you think about man's rebellion, in Romans chapter 1, it says, we have been created in the image of God.</p><p>In Romans chapter 1, what does it say? We, right, traded in the image of the glorious God for what? For idols that look like us, right? So we've been created in the image of God to reflect God's glory, but man's rebellion is, he begins to make idols that look like him and worship it.</p><p>He's worshiping himself, right? So why is all this here? All of this is telling us where man went wrong, right? This is a description of man's rebellion. This is what God intended. This is what mankind is rebelling against. The garden had four rivers flow out of it. Pishon, Gihon, Tigris, Euphrates.</p><p>Pishon and Gihon, we're not exactly sure where it is, right? But theologians believe that it goes in the opposite direction of Tigris and Euphrates. Here's the picture of Tigris and Euphrates. Okay, anyway, Euphrates and Tigris, okay? And then we don't know exactly where the other two are, but they believe that if you follow the line, that the Garden of Eden would be somewhere around that circle.</p><p>Okay, so here's the actual picture of the Garden of Eden that they found. Some of you are like, oh, really? Okay, this is just to make sure you're paying attention. And here's a tree of life that they found. So we don't know exactly where it is, okay? But it's somewhere in Iraq.</p><p>At least that's what most theologians believe, based upon that. So what is the significance of the river, right? In the ancient, like today, again, the water doesn't have the kind of same significance that we had. But in ancient times, when they're talking to the Israelites, they would have understood immediately that all four rivers, major rivers, are coming from the Garden of Eden, which to them would mean that's where life is, right?</p><p>The origin of life is here, in the Garden of Eden, because that's how they would have understood it, because all civilization has to be around water. So just like Psalm 1-3 says, a man who meditates in the law of the Lord, he is like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season, and his eve does not wither, and whatever he does, he prospers.</p><p>So he equates someone who is living constantly as somebody by the river, right? By the water. So that's how they would have understood it. The four rivers flowed in all four directions. Again, we don't know the other two, but they assume that that's probably the case. And so if you were to tell this to an Israelite, they would have understood that these four major rivers all had the origin in the same place, that that's where life was coming from.</p><p>Okay? And then if you look at Revelation chapter 22, verse 1 and 2, it describes heaven in this way, right? He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of the street. On the other side of the river was a tree of life, bearing 12 kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nation.</p><p>So remember what I said, right? Genesis is written to tell us what went wrong. And so the rest of the Bible is redeeming back to what was lost. And so Revelation chapter 22 is a description of the garden, right? So is it exactly going to be the garden? No, but it is a picture of what God intended that he's going to restore.</p><p>Okay? Now this is going to take us to next week that we're just going to drop and then we'll talk about next week. It says, if the man eats of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he shall surely die. If life is a breath in him, right?</p><p>If life came to us through the breath, right? That means, he said, if you eat of it, you shall surely die, meaning that breath must have left. Because physically we're still existing. Right? And that's what it says in Revelation chapter, you know, with all the churches. And he said, if you do not repent, I will take away my lampstand.</p><p>In other words, his presence is going to be withdrawn. So how does God withdraw his presence in mankind? It's his breath. Right? And that's why if you look at the new covenant, what is the symbol? What makes us alive in the new covenant? The Holy Spirit. Right? The Holy Spirit.</p><p>His presence comes back in, in the spirit. What was lost because of our sin? And then, what is the primary agent in which the Holy Spirit comes? Second Timothy 3.16. All scripture is what? God breathed. So it is the preaching of the word of God. When people hear it and they have faith, and then they believe, and the presence of God is restored in that man.</p><p>In other words, God's breathing his breath back into that man. Right? And so he is born again. And that's how it's described in John chapter 3. Right? You must be born again of the spirit. Right? So in the Old Testament, in the creation, God puts his breath in him and he comes to life.</p><p>He breaks God's commandment. He gets kicked out of the Sabbath. The breath of God is no longer with him. Right? And then God redeems us by covering us with the blood of Christ. And then the Holy Spirit is able to reenter because now we've been covered. Otherwise, the Holy Spirit would destroy us.</p><p>Right? The presence of God would destroy us without the covering of his blood. And so the distinction between the old and the new is the Holy Spirit. Right? That's why when in Ephesians it says to be filled with the Holy Spirit, it's another way of saying of be filled with God's life.</p><p>That's what it means. Okay? I mentioned this already, so I'll just slip that. Okay. Let me look at the creation of woman. Right? He says it's not good for man to be alone. Now, we know that the good here is not talking about moral good because he uses this word to talk about creation.</p><p>Meaning that he was not complete. Right? Everything is not complete. So, in other words, when he says creation was good, this was good, this was good, is that everything God intended was exactly the way he wanted except for man. He's not complete. And then he says he forms man, asat, to form from something.</p><p>Right? Or the woman. And he said he's looking for someone who is suitable helper. She was made to be a complement and not a supplement. Okay? You understand the difference? Supplement, he's doing something, and then she comes along, basically adds to what he's doing. Complement is there. She, God created her to do something that he cannot do on his own.</p><p>Right? So, God created woman to be a complement. She is a helper, like the Holy Spirit is a helper in a Trinitarian union. So, if you look in the Bible, the Holy Spirit is empowering, Holy Spirit is convicting, Holy Spirit is in the background doing all this work. God is the one who initiates, Jesus mediates, and then the Holy Spirit is the one who carries it out.</p><p>Right? And so, that's the role of the wife, and that's how God created her, to be a suitable helper. So, this is really interesting, but for the sake of time, I'm not going to get too deep into it, but like I said, everything that we're doing, we're just kind of flying by so quick, but, you know, if you, if any of this triggers, like, your thought or questions, and obviously, I'm not going to be able to answer all your questions, I hope your appetite gets wet enough to be able to come back and dig on your own.</p><p>There's no way that we're going to be able to cover all of this, okay? God puts him into deep sleep, almost like he's in an operation, right? Obviously, but also, when God ratifies, remember in Genesis chapter 15, when God brings a covenant to Abraham, he falls asleep, he separates the animal into two, and God ratifies the covenant on his own.</p><p>So, in instances where God is ratifying a covenant, he basically, he basically protects the man. God put them together, right? In, typically, in a wedding ceremony, it says, what God has put together, let no man separate. There's a two becoming one. But in God's creation, what happens? One becomes two, right?</p><p>So, God's intent was, one became two, and because of a sin, what happens? Shame comes in. And then, so, they separate from each other. So, the wedding ceremony is two coming back to one, right? It's the restoration of what was lost in creation to bring us back to that, right?</p><p>That's what the whole wedding ceremony is. And that's why, you know, when the, if you look at the whole drama of the wedding ceremony of the bride coming in, the groom is standing, receiving her. She's waiting a white dress. Ephesians chapter 5 makes her holy. And then, they become union, two candles lighting into one.</p><p>It's not, you know, that they made it into, you know, two families are joining together as one, which is also true. But really, it's about two people that's been separated because of sin is coming to one, becoming one, because that's what God intended. He literally took one man and made two, right?</p><p>So, this signifies the three things here. Closeness, right? That the relationship between husband and wife is literally flesh among flesh, bone of my bones. That's what God intended, right? Not only to signify closeness, but similarity, right? That two becoming one, you work so well together that you become very similar and then equal in dignity because you're made of the same substance, right?</p><p>Just the, even the word man, ish, in Hebrew, in, for woman is isha, which is just basically adding an ah, right? In some, I think, is it Spanish? You add an a, it becomes effeminate, right? I think it's like that. Is that true in Latin? I didn't take Latin.</p><p>Yes, in Latin. Spanish, Latin, I think in a bunch of other languages. Yeah, Russian, I think, is like that, right? Female names have a at the end to feminize. So, basically, the word for man is ish and female is isha, right? They were both naked and were not ashamed, no problem understanding each other.</p><p>In other words, they were united as one. Then as soon as sin comes in, they separate the two. All right. Okay. Like I said, you know, I have to go over it real quick because we don't have time to cover all of this. But every part of what we talked about today, you can dive into and have a whole separate study.</p><p>Even if you can't get, like, complete satisfying answers, but you'll begin to see how this is connected to rest of Scripture. You know how some of you may have been here when we're studying the book of Leviticus, right? How many of you are here when we're studying Leviticus? Okay, a few of you.</p><p>Remember how every part of Leviticus, that didn't make sense. Once you begin to understand the background behind it, how much it is directly connected to the gospel, it helps us to understand the gospel. Like, what is sin? What is redemption? What is restoration? What does repentance look like? Degrees of sin, right?</p><p>So, just like Leviticus kind of opens the door to have a clearer, more HD version of the gospel, Genesis functions the same way, right? When you really understand Genesis, at least the first three, four, five chapters of it, it really begins to open up, like, what he's doing. The redemptive history is going to make a lot more sense, okay?</p><p>All right, I'm not going to go over the study question. You'll get this through the email, but here's a discussion question for you. So, if you can discuss these four things. If a man's life was given to us by the breath of God and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a new life in Christ, how well do you think you understand the role of the Holy Spirit in your life, right?</p><p>Is it just the background information so that Scripture emphasizes over and over again, right? Walk in the Spirit, pray in the Spirit, be filled in the Spirit, right? Love in the Spirit. If God gave the role of cultivating the garden and to rule over creation, how did sin affect this calling?</p><p>What does it look like? In what practical ways was Eve to be suitable helper to Adam? How did sin affect this relationship? And again, all this stuff, we'll get into a little bit more detail next week. And then finally, what areas of your life do you think is not under submission of God's original intent in creation?</p><p>So, things that you've seen, right? What do you notice, not just in society, but even in your own life that is not in accord with what God intended in creation, okay? Let me pray first, and then I'll let you go to your discussion time. Father, we pray for deeper understanding.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to use this time of discussion to honor you, to search our heart, to know you. And we pray, Father, that our understanding will go beyond just knowledge, but that it would reform us, strengthen us, and correct us, that we may truly live lives worthy of the gospel you've given.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
