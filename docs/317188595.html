Heavenly Father, we thank you for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=11s">00:00:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">blessing that we have.

One of the things that, again, I want to emphasize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=39s">00:00:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">each week. And then the rest of it is for you to fill out as we go through the passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=45s">00:00:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if you want to make notes, the Bible verses are written down for you on the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=50s">00:00:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">page. And I'm hoping that you'll take notes here. And then the more organized notes on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=56s">00:00:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this one. Okay, so on this one it'll kind of give you an outline and I just left it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=61s">00:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">blank. So what I write down on this, you may want to write down on this because this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=66s">00:01:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">something that you'll probably hold on to. But I also gave you this because I want you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=70s">00:01:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to see where we're getting at. I don't want you to just say, you know, look at verse two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=74s">00:01:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and three and then I just write it down. So I want you to see where we're getting at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=77s">00:01:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the goal of this study is not for me to just tell you what it means. It's for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=81s">00:01:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to go and get in the habit of studying the Bible for yourself. Okay. All right, so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=87s">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you look at the first page, the first principle that we want to look at, Scripture must interpret</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=94s">00:01:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture. God does not contradict himself. Though the Bible was written in the span of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=99s">00:01:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">1500 years through 45 different human authors, the true author was God through the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=106s">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore we must interpret each letter in light of the context of the whole of Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=109s">00:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what it means is God is not going to say something that he said otherwise in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=116s">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">another text. So if you're interpreting a passage and it contradicts something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=120s">00:02:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was already stated in Scripture, most likely your interpretation is not correct. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=126s">00:02:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like, again, this is not unique to the Bible. This is, if you're having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=130s">00:02:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation and you know, in the same conversation, if he said, I love apples, I hate apples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=137s">00:02:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, then you say, okay, I must've heard something wrong or he meant, he must've meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=141s">00:02:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hated apples in some other context. Right? So in Scripture, we have to understand that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=148s">00:02:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the author is the Holy Spirit. He used the agents of human beings, but ultimate author</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=153s">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">author is one person, the Holy Spirit. Right? And so therefore what he says in another text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=160s">00:02:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is not going to contradict what he says in, let's say, you know, in Hebrews, he's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=165s">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to contradict what he says in James or in Galatians. So that's what it means by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=169s">00:02:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing Scripture to interpret Scripture. One of the reasons why I always quote cross</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=177s">00:02:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">references, whether it's my preaching or in Bible study, is because, is for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=182s">00:03:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that the interpretation of that passage is consistent with rest of Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=188s">00:03:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're not just seeing, it's like, well, this is what it says. And we're just pulling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=191s">00:03:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning out of that, that you need to be in the habit of, if this is what it means, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=196s">00:03:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">must've said it somewhere else. In fact, oftentimes looking at other passages will help you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=201s">00:03:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what he's saying here, because it's in the larger context of what he means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=206s">00:03:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So how this is applied in this particular text is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=210s">00:03:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in verse 24. So if you look at verse 24, it says, now I rejoice in the suffering for my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=217s">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sake and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body, which is the church, in filling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=223s">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">up what is lacking in Christ's affliction. So if you looked at that outside of any other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=228s">00:03:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">context and just looked at that verse alone, what could you say of this? Which would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=237s">00:03:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">outright heresy. Apostle Paul is contributing to our atonement. Yes? Okay, you guys are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=246s">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all looking at me like you have no idea what I'm talking about. Verse 24, right? If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=251s">00:04:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">were to interpret that, if you're not paying attention, you look at that verse and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=256s">00:04:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">say, well, clearly scripture said, you're quoting the passage, right? There's a verse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=261s">00:04:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a line where Paul says, I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=267s">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a part of what Jesus did on the cross wasn't complete. So therefore Paul is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=272s">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fulfilling a necessary part of the atonement. Is that what Paul means? Clearly that's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=278s">00:04:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what Paul means. Because Paul says clearly in other passages that that is not the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=283s">00:04:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what it means by allowing scripture to interpret scripture. If you have detailed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=290s">00:04:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation with cults, this is where they go wrong. So as a young Christian, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=296s">00:04:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to a Jehovah Witness, they'll quote verses and they'll tell you, well, clearly Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=301s">00:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">said this and they said this and Jesus is a God, not the God. And they'll have plenty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=306s">00:05:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of verses to back it up. Right? But they're taking it out of context. And that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=312s">00:05:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">bad doctrine comes from. So if this is cannot mean what it could because it clearly contradicts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=318s">00:05:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">rest of scripture. There's a few verses I want you to look up. John chapter 14 verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=324s">00:05:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">4 and John chapter 536. So if I can have somebody read out loud John chapter 17 verse 4, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=335s">00:05:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the guys tables can read that. And then John 536, one of the ladies tables can read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=341s">00:05:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Okay. And I'm just going to point to somebody. Isaac usually my go to guy here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=347s">00:05:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's pretty quick looking at passages. John 17, 4, if you can look at it real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=354s">00:05:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">17, 4. Does it look wrong? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that is the verse. Okay. And then denies John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=374s">00:06:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">536 over there. Okay. Okay. I could have obviously picked, you know, tons of and dozens of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=393s">00:06:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">passages to refer to his atonement being uniquely Jesus's fulfilled work. When Jesus was crucified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=400s">00:06:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on the cross, he says it is finished. And again, you know, I'm not going to go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=404s">00:06:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that doctrine here, but clearly the New Testament teaches that Christ's work on the cross is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=410s">00:06:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">final and complete. There's nothing lacking. So what does Paul mean here when he says what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=415s">00:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is lacking in his affliction? So if you can look with me to Philippians chapter 230, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=420s">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">get an example, at least language wise, because it's the same author writing Colossians writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=425s">00:07:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Philippians chapter 230. If I can have a one of the guys read that. Johnny Wang, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=434s">00:07:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can read Philippians 230 for me. And then Samantha, if you can read Romans 10, 14. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=450s">00:07:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul uses, again, he's not talking about Christ's atonement, but he uses a very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=455s">00:07:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">language talking about how he was completing what was lacking in his service. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=462s">00:07:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the language is the same. He's saying that something that Paul was doing that he needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=466s">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">help in, and he talks about that in the context of, again, lacking. Romans chapter 10, 14,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=473s">00:07:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think you guys know that passage well. Okay. So that passage is talking about how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=487s">00:08:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ fulfilled his work on the cross, but he says how will this become effective if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=493s">00:08:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they do not hear? And how will they hear if they are not sent? So he's talking about there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=498s">00:08:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a gap between what Christ has done and the evangelization, right? And making of disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=503s">00:08:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul says we need to send people to bridge that gap. Like we need to go. So what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=510s">00:08:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">best interpretation of this? In light of everything else that we see. Paul is bridging the gap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=520s">00:08:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">between his finished work on the cross and evangelizing and getting the word out. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=525s">00:08:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if you read the context of the text that we're looking at, that's exactly what he's talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=529s">00:08:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about. His own ministry of the gospel. Right? So he's not talking about atonement. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=536s">00:08:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he's bridging the gap, what is lacking in atonement. He's saying in evangelizing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=541s">00:09:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">get the word out. You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So if we get this wrong, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=546s">00:09:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is where bad doctrine comes from. And this is why so many Christians are intimidated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=551s">00:09:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk to cult members because they quote passages. And most Christians are not aware</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=558s">00:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the passage that they're quoting is out of context. Right? And so it's very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=564s">00:09:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important that when you are studying the scripture that you know not only what that verse says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=570s">00:09:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but the context in which it is said. That's why even memorizing scripture, you know, I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=575s">00:09:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">had so many scripture verses that I memorized out of context. And years later as I was studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=581s">00:09:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible, what I thought it said was completely different when I began to study it. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=586s">00:09:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's still value in studying, I mean, memorizing scripture topically. But it's equally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=593s">00:09:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">important, maybe even more important that you understand the context in which that verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=597s">00:09:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">came out of. Or else that's where bad doctrine typically comes from. Okay? So that's one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=603s">00:10:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of the principles that I hope you remember. That's why cross references is always important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=609s">00:10:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially early on in studying the Bible. If you're studying the scriptures and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=614s">00:10:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">say, wow, this is a great revelation. Make sure you double check with other cross references</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=619s">00:10:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that is consistent with what he said in other passages. Okay? All right. Let's jump in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=626s">00:10:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">As I did last week and the previous weeks, I divided the text into an outline. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=633s">00:10:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">why I kind of divided the way I did. I saw, again, number two in the outline that I gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=639s">00:10:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you, outline of this passage in three parts. Verse 21 to 23, it gives our past, present,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=646s">00:10:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and future standing before God. So before we jump into the text, to get a broad outline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=653s">00:10:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of his flow of thought. So that you're going to, when you're studying the word or you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=659s">00:10:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">studying the sentence or you're studying the paragraph, you understand what he is saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=663s">00:11:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">before and what he's saying after. Right? To always understand it in context. So he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=668s">00:11:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">starts out, at least in this text, about our past, present, and future standing before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=673s">00:11:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">God, 24 to 27, Paul's calling to the gospel ministry. And then thirdly, verse 28 to 29,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=682s">00:11:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's work in the gospel ministry. How is God accomplishing this work through Paul?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=688s">00:11:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 28 through 29. Okay. That's already written for you, so you don't need to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=698s">00:11:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all that. All right. So the first section, I said past, present, and future. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=703s">00:11:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">look at verse 21, again, none of this is something that you have to go to the commentary for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=710s">00:11:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you spent enough time in front of this text, you can gain these insights for yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=714s">00:11:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So if you look at the first three verses, you can clearly see that there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=727s">00:12:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">past component of the first verse. Right? He says, "Although you were formerly alienated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=735s">00:12:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds." And then the present, "But now, he has now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=743s">00:12:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reconciled you through his fleshly body and to present you blameless." And then the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=754s">00:12:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is called to persevere, to continue to go forward. Right? So in the first section, verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=761s">00:12:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">21, 22, and 23, past, present, and future of where we stand before God. Right? Remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=772s">00:12:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the things that I asked you to do when you're looking for observations, that see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=775s">00:12:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">if you see any contrasting ideas. Do you see any in this section? How do you see it? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=792s">00:13:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Alienated and reconciled. Okay? Right? Before we were alienated, now we're reconciled. Anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=802s">00:13:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">else? Hostile in mind. Okay, that's not the word I want to use. Hostile in mind. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=823s">00:13:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Talking about the mind being hostile, being reconciled in the flesh. Right? So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=830s">00:13:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the third part, "Engaged in the evil deeds, but presented as blameless." Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=837s">00:13:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's talking about, so each one of these lines basically nullifies the other. Was reconciled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=845s">00:14:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was alienated, but reconciled. Hostile in mind, but atoned in the flesh. Engaged in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=851s">00:14:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">evil deeds, presented to be holy. Right? So I don't think it's by accident. Paul is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=857s">00:14:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">systematically targeting, this is who you were, but what Jesus did nullifies and transferred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=863s">00:14:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Right? And then the third verse, he points to the future where he says, "But if indeed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=872s">00:14:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you continue in the faith." So this is not passive. He's not saying, "This is what happened."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=882s">00:14:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That you just kind of enjoy yourself. He adds that if this is you, and it will be continued</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=889s">00:14:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be you, if you continue in the faith, firmly established, steadfast, and not moved away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=897s">00:14:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So all three of these words are basically saying the same thing. That you continue this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=902s">00:15:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">path. You persevere. Right? You don't just hear it and say, "Oh, we're justified and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=907s">00:15:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're just waiting to get to heaven." He talks about sanctification and the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=912s">00:15:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of persevering is staying steadfast. How do we stay steadfast? In faith, from the hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=917s">00:15:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Right? Staying grounded in the hope. So one of the questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=922s">00:15:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I asked in your discussion question is, if our justification, he says, will carry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=929s">00:15:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">us on to completion if we hold fast to our confession in faith. Right? And remain steadfast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=936s">00:15:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So these aren't just passive, where you're just kind of on the boat and you're just floating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=940s">00:15:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the problem with the Hebrews. Right? The recipient of Hebrews was they got on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=944s">00:15:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">boat and they're just drifting. But here he says to hold fast. Right? In faith. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=953s">00:15:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So past, present, and future. The second part, verse 23, 24 to 27, talking about Paul's ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=969s">00:16:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's five things that I observed about Paul's ministry. One, he says he rejoiced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=979s">00:16:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the suffering for your sake. One of the questions that came up when he says, "When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=985s">00:16:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he reconciled." What verse was that? Yeah, verse 22. Yeah, he is clearly referring to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1003s">00:16:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ because he's talking about how he reconciled in his body. Okay? That was one of the questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1007s">00:16:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that came in. All right. So the five things that I noticed in verse 24 through 27 about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1014s">00:16:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's ministry is that Paul considered his suffering a joy. Okay? Now, an average person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1023s">00:17:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it's like, "Well, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ. There's a special anointing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1026s">00:17:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in him. And he says that." But how many times do you see a Christian, like, actually saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1032s">00:17:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm suffering for your sake and I rejoice over it." Right? If somebody said that, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1036s">00:17:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">would almost be cynical thinking you're fake. Like, be real. Tell me how you really feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1042s">00:17:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Now, we would never accuse Apostle Paul of that because he's an apostle. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1047s">00:17:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's directly linked to what he said previously. If his hope is firmly grounded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1052s">00:17:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ, yes, his suffering is leading to greater glory. And it's because of his great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1057s">00:17:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">faith he's able to see it in joy. Right? But if your hope is laid up here, how can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1063s">00:17:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering be rejoicing? It's only when you see suffering as a way of greater glory. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1070s">00:17:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you believe that. So, one, he says his suffering. And then, what suffering is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1075s">00:17:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he talking about here? What context is he writing this letter? Remember? Huh? He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1086s">00:18:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a prisoner. So, this is one of the prisoner epistles. So, he's in Rome writing this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1090s">00:18:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when he says he's suffering, everybody's aware where he is. Right? And then he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1099s">00:18:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">number two, his work for the church. And in my flesh I do my share on behalf of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1109s">00:18:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then third, in work for Christ. And then fourth, that God gave him this stewardship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1129s">00:18:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He's rejoicing. He's doing his part for the church. He's doing his part for the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1137s">00:18:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And spreading the gospel. Fourth, he says he was appointed by God. And fifthly, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1144s">00:19:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about the message itself. Right? Is a mystery. So, when he says God appointed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1151s">00:19:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">him to be able to fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, he says the full, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1157s">00:19:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching of the word of God is making the mystery known. Like that's God's will. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1163s">00:19:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What was hidden, now they know. But there's so much more to be revealed. Even now. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1171s">00:19:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">How many of you, and again this is a rhetorical question, have been Christians more than ten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1174s">00:19:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">years and did not make the connection of Leviticus to the New Testament? Right? It's a rhetorical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1180s">00:19:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">question. You don't have to answer. My guess is most of you didn't. Right? Because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1187s">00:19:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">just not taught. But those of you who made the connection, now look back at it. How important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1193s">00:19:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">how important is Leviticus in understanding the gospel? Crucial. Right? Now how many Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1202s">00:20:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in our, you know, in our area or around the world do you think understand that connection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1207s">00:20:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">between what God was doing in Leviticus in understanding the depth of the gospel? Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1212s">00:20:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Very few. So, Paul says the preaching of the gospel is the mystery being revealed. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1219s">00:20:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so he describes his preaching of the gospel as connecting the dots. What Christ has done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1224s">00:20:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and what God had done in the Old Testament. Right? And that was preaching of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1229s">00:20:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So the preaching of the gospel isn't simply God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1233s">00:20:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">life. The gospel actually begins in the Old Testament. Right? Gospel doesn't start in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1238s">00:20:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Matthew chapter one. It starts in the beginning. All of it is the gospel. So when somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1245s">00:20:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">says you know you got to preach the gospel and say God loves you, has a wonderful plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1249s">00:20:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">for your life. That's, they're starting at the midpoint. Starting point is all of sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1253s">00:20:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and fall short of the glory of God. Right? And what God was doing through all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1259s">00:20:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So the third part, verse 28 through 29, Paul's work in the gospel ministry. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1275s">00:21:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">know if you can read my writing. All right. So four things I saw. One, we proclaim him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1282s">00:21:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the core of this mystery being revealed is Christ himself. Right? That's why you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1288s">00:21:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">hear all the times that all of the Bible is about Christ. Because Christ is at the center</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1292s">00:21:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of all of this. Not only is he the creator, not only is the sustainer, not only is he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1298s">00:21:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the goal, he's the mediator. Right? He's the fulfiller. All of the Bible at the center</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1305s">00:21:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of it is Christ. Right? So remember we talked about context. If you're interpreting a passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1314s">00:21:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're preaching something and you don't know how to connect that to Christ, you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1318s">00:21:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't interpret that correctly. Okay? I give you an example about the book of Jonah. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1328s">00:22:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The point of that story is not don't mess with God or Wales is going to kill you. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1333s">00:22:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">end. What does that have to do with redemptive history? Not saying that there aren't principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1340s">00:22:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where God teaches us how to behave. Like does the Bible teach us don't mess with God? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1345s">00:22:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Does the Bible teach us that we need to rely on him? All of these things are true. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1349s">00:22:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">if the central message is Christ and you don't see any connection to Christ, you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1354s">00:22:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">miss the bigger picture in that text. Right? So the central message of Jonah is God raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1361s">00:22:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">up the nation of Israel to be a light to the world. Right? And he was self-focused. Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1369s">00:22:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">only cared about Israel. God said from the very beginning that I'm going to bless you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1373s">00:22:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and through you many other nations are going to be blessed. But they completely forgot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1376s">00:22:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">about that. So all of that in redemptive history. And the same thing with the church. He said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1382s">00:23:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">if we are the light and we lose the light, right? And we're for the salt of the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1387s">00:23:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and we lose our saltiness. He said what good is it for? That's basically what was happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1392s">00:23:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">with the nation of Israel. Right? So number one, Paul's ministry was proclaiming Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1400s">00:23:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">at the center. Two, the work was admonishing every man and teaching every man with all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1407s">00:23:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">wisdom. So right off in Matthew chapter 28, right? Make disciples, baptizing them in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1415s">00:23:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">name of the father, son, and holy spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1419s">00:23:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you. So it's not like he's not simply saying God is awesome, he died for us, isn't he awesome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1425s">00:23:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">let's go to heaven. Right? So Paul's preaching and preaching about Christ includes admonishing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1431s">00:23:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">teaching, rebuking, training in righteousness. Right? So that process of sanctification is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1439s">00:23:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">part of what it means to put our hope in Christ. So that was also his preaching. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1446s">00:24:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for whatever the reason in our modern era, preaching imperative has been dismissed as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1452s">00:24:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">moralism. Right? It's moralism if you don't connect that to Christ. But if you connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1458s">00:24:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it to Christ, Christ will always call us to holiness. So you can't separate these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1463s">00:24:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things. You can't separate the preaching of the gospel and then say imperatives are legalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1468s">00:24:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because imperatives are part of the gospel. Right? We no longer obey the law, but we obey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1475s">00:24:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the law of what? Christ. Right? So that's number two. Three, to present everyone, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1486s">00:24:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">man complete in Christ. Right? So he's not just teaching and he's not just training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1493s">00:24:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">His goal is to bring them to the end conclusion. So the word for complete here basically means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1499s">00:24:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to bring them to the logical end. So the point of justification is to be reconciled so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1508s">00:25:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">they can go back to where God intended. That's what the word complete means. It doesn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1514s">00:25:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">complete perfect that somehow during this lifetime you're going to be complete. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1519s">00:25:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You're never going to sin. You never have doubts. You never have, you know, you do anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1522s">00:25:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong. The word complete basically means to bring to completion. So in other words, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1530s">00:25:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">justifies us in order to sanctify us. Right? Those two things are not separate. So Paul's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1538s">00:25:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry preaching Christ, admonishing every man to bring him to the logical conclusion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1544s">00:25:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of their salvation. To make every man complete. And then finally he says all of this by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1549s">00:25:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">power that's working within him. So it starts with him. Right? You can't be an effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1558s">00:25:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">minister at any capacity. Small group, one to one, college, singles, married, family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1566s">00:26:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't be effective in any way if the work is not all first happening with you. He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1573s">00:26:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he's laboring according to the power which mightily works within me. So the primary and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1580s">00:26:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the most important thing that every Christian has to be is making sure that Christ is affecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1585s">00:26:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you first. Because everything else that you do without Christ affecting you is just your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1593s">00:26:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">labor is kicking against the goal. Building something that you have no power to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1600s">00:26:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Bringing someone from darkness to light. You have no power to do that. It's only when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1605s">00:26:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Holy Spirit is working in us and through us. And that's what Paul says. Okay? Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1610s">00:26:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, we can go deep into any one of these things, but again the goal of this is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1614s">00:26:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you to see, again, if you spend enough time in front of the Bible and just ask questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1620s">00:27:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">outlining, thinking, cross-referencing back and forth, that these are insights that any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1626s">00:27:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">one of you can have. Okay? And so my hope and prayer is that you would learn to do quiet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1633s">00:27:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">time in this way. That you don't just skim through three chapters and say I did my quiet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1637s">00:27:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time. But sit there and dig. Because so much comes out when you take your time. Especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1641s">00:27:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those of you guys who are memorizing the book of James. Right? Even sometimes after you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1646s">00:27:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">memorized it, like years later you'll be thinking about it. Oh, that's what that meant. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1652s">00:27:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you have it in your head, but you haven't really like, you didn't really dig.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/317188595#t=1656s">00:27:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So anytime you study the scripture, just take some time.
