We're going to go into our closing song. So why don't we all stand together?  How great the chasm that lay between us. How high the mountain I could not climb. In desperation, I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night. Then through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul. The work is finished. The end is written. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Who could imagine so great a mercy? What heart could fathom such boundless grace? The God of ages stepped down from glory to wear my sin and bear my shame. The cross has spoken. I am forgiven. The King of kings calls me his own. Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah. Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. There's salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. And King of mourning that's filled up from this, your buried body began to breathe. Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared, the grave has no claim on me. Then came the morning. Then came the morning that sealed the promise. Your buried body began to breathe. Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared, the grave has no claim on me. Jesus Christ is the victory. Oh, hallelujah. Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. There's salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah. Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. There's salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Jesus Christ, my living hope. That's all about our heads in prayer. Our God, we are so thankful to you for your sufficient grace and your mercies to us. Thank you, God, that we as a church can come together and learn in this way, to hear from your word, to fellowship and be able to encourage each other and be challenged by the practice of the application of faith and seeing faith powerfully move in each one of us. I ask, Father God, as tomorrow is Sunday and we come to worship, help us to return to a renewed sense of dedication, a renewed sense of worship and adoration to you, that God, we would render our hearts to you. And Lord, it is our prayer that for every single one of us, though each day we have our responsibilities, our work, and our schedules that are full and busy, help us, Father God, to learn what it means to walk with you in such a way. We're so cognizant, Lord, of your holiness. And God, that we're walking in such a way where we are worshiping you. And God, that we're considering you above all things. Lord, we thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen. - Amen. - All right. We wanna thank all of you guys for coming and definitely wanna thank our team, all the volunteers who put this together. So let's give 'em a big round. (audience applauding) Thank you guys for leading praise. Just as a quick note, as Kevin mentioned, we do need just some help. For those of you guys who just like things to be straight, some of our chairs right now, as you can tell, kinda got shifted around and stuff, so please help us set up for Sunday. And then we just need helping hands, make sure we're bringing the white chairs and tables back into the sanctuary and the racks. So thanks for your help, have a good night, everyone.
