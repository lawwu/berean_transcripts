And we thank you, Father God, for the opportunity for us to come and study. We ask, Lord, that your living word would have its purpose, help us to be focused, energized, strengthened. And that our state of mind, our hearts, and our lives may all of it, Lord God, be aligned with what you desire for us. So we pray for your blessing this evening, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.  All right, so just kind of as a overview, we're focusing on chapter seven and eight today, chapter seven and eight.  Were the questions a little bit harder today?  Yeah, probably, right? I made it so that it required a little bit more work than normal.  How many of your tables don't have this sheet?  How many have extra on your table?  There's a few extra on this table.  Esther, do you need more?  Esther, do you need more?  Okay, there's some more over here.  How many guys have extra? I know you guys have extra here too.  You need more?  Who has extra of today's?  David. You have extra? How many extra? Esther, they have more here.  And there's more here. Just take what you need, let the people come later, they can look for it.  All right.  I hope you guys had an opportunity to read Second Kings chapter 16, not 15. I hope you figured it out. I hope you didn't read chapter 15 and then say, it's kind of hard.  Or the answer's hidden.  Because it was a mistake. It was chapter 16, okay?  So what is the background of chapter 16?  Basically, the story behind it is that the king of the Northern Kingdom, what's his name?  What is the king of the Northern Kingdom?  Well, that's the father.  Pekka, right? And then the king of Assyria?  Huh?  It's just for review.  Who's the king of Assyria that's coming in?  That's the guy that they want to appoint in Judah.  Huh? >> Romalia? >> Romalia is the-  Okay.  I think it'd be better if you just read through it.  Resin, resin, okay?  Resin. It's in verse one.  So basically, Pekka, the son of Romalia, Romalia? Yeah, Romalia, and the king of Assyria, they basically joined forces. But basically what happened was, they wanted to join forces to attack Assyria, or to defend themselves against Assyria. But what the southern kingdom does, instead of aligning themselves with Israel and, okay, give me a second, let me get this straight out of my own head.  Okay, okay, all right. So the king of Syria and the king of the northern kingdom, they actually come and ask the king of the southern kingdom to join forces against Assyria, okay? So that's where it's at. Not Syria and the northern kingdom came and asked the southern kingdom to join forces against Assyria. All right, it's not confusing, right?  It's not that confusing, right? So, but Ahaz, the king of the southern kingdom, basically thinks that this is not a good alliance. Instead of joining with them, who does he join forces with? With Assyria, right? And so because he joins forces with Assyria, the two kings get mad at the southern kingdom, and they join forces to come and attack them, right? You read this. You're looking at me like I'm saying something you've never heard before, okay? So they come down to attack the southern kingdom, but the southern kingdom, remember, they have alliance with Assyria. And so Assyria comes and actually protects them, and then basically defeats the other two kings. Yes? Okay, why is this so important? Because everything we're talking about is about that event, okay? It's about that particular event where King Ahaz decides to trust in Assyria instead of God. And so even though they experience temporary success, God basically is going to bring judgment upon them, right? For not trusting in God and trusting Assyria, he says, basically what he's saying is, you've experienced temporary relief from whatever suffering that you thought was going to come because Assyria got on your plan, but Assyria is actually going to turn on you, and they're going to come attack you, okay? And so that is the historical backdrop behind what's happening, okay? So chapter seven through chapter 12, basically is kind of one theme, and that theme is, what happens to a nation that doesn't believe in God, that turns against God? Was Ahaz a good king or a bad king? He's a bad king, right? So he's mentioned four kings, right? We have, what's the first king? Uzziah, right? King Uzziah, who's the second king? Jotham, and then third king? Ahaz, which is this king, and then the fourth king? Hezekiah, okay, so we're not there with Hezekiah yet, okay? So out of the four kings that, the period that Isaiah prophesied, and out of the four kings, who was good and who was bad? Ahaz was the bad one. Uzziah, was he a good king? Yes, but? Okay, he didn't remove the high places, basically it was idolatry, right? And then Jotham, the same, right? And then Ahaz was bad from the beginning to the end, and then Hezekiah was actually a good king. So what's happening here is, Dorian, who's right? Who's right here? Ahaz. So it was during a period when Israel was actually just completely under Ahaz's reign, they were doing evil. So remember we talked about that last week? Last week, the prophecies are against during a period when Uzziah was reigning, right? So judgment is coming upon Uzziah and his kingdom, although Uzziah was a good king for the most part, but he didn't get rid of all of the idols. So he says, because he didn't completely obey, the judgment of God is coming. Now we come to Ahaz, right? God talks about judgment, but He also talks about, what else does He talk about? Redemption. There's a lot of talk about redemption, right? In fact, at the beginning of it, He's actually pleading with Israel to come and do this, and to test me, and to know me, right? So the theme of this passage, or at least I titled it, The Good and Bad of Emmanuel, right? There's a dual nature of Emmanuel that we're going to see. The famous passage in Isaiah chapter 7, 14, when the virgin shall have a child through a virgin. And so the theme of this text in chapter 7 and on, but in particular the first two chapters, chapter 7 and 8, is about the presence of God. Typically, when we think of the presence of God, depending on who you are, if you are somebody who's expecting judgment, when God comes, it means judgment, right? If you're somebody who's waiting for redemption, if God comes, it means redemption. So you see both sides of it. He says that Emmanuel is going to come, but we're going to talk a little bit more about that when we get to that text. But when he says the prophecy that I will give you a sign, and the sign will be of the Emmanuel, the virgin birth, is that a promise of hope or is that a promise of devastation? It's both, and we're going to see that. There's dual nature of Emmanuel, right? So let's start looking at it, okay? Again I apologize if I put the wrong text up. I hope you read it. So today I'm going to go over it a little bit differently. Based on some of the conversations I had, a lot of you guys had questions about the questions that I asked you, that you kind of wanted me to answer some of these. So today I outlined the study based upon the questions. So if you take previous week's questions that you have and just follow along the questions, that's how we're going to be covering it today, okay? So that's how it's organized if you look at it, if you haven't figured that out already, right? Why is God helping Ahaz considering how wicked he was? So if you look at chapter 7, verses 1 through 9, God sends Ahaz to, God sends Isaiah to Ahaz and basically he's encouraging him to trust him, right? Why is he helping him? He sends him the Naqtivey of Syria and Ephraim, and Ephraim is just another name for the northern kingdom because God will deliver him from their hands. These two kingdoms are like two smoldering stumps of firebrands. In other words, you don't need to fear these kingdoms, right? They may be, you might be afraid of them right now, but in my eyes, all they are is a smoldering stump and firebrands. In other words, they're already dead, right? The final blow just hasn't come yet, it's going to come, so there's nothing to fear, right? So basically God is sending Isaiah to encourage him that don't be afraid of these two things, right? These two kingdoms, they're not going to be able to ultimately harm you. God is faithful to his own people and his own promises. So even though Ahaz is a wicked king, God's faithfulness to the nation of Israel still stands, right? We talked about that even Sunday, about how God is faithful, because of the wickedness of the nation of Israel, has God forsaken the covenant that he made? He said, "By no means," right? And so here's another example of that. Here's King Ahaz, even though he was a wicked king, he still considered them his nation, and he's still faithful to them, right? So God is not pleading with Ahaz because Ahaz was a king who deserved it, he's trying to preserve his own kingdom, right? So Isaiah's son's name, there's three children's names that are mentioned, right? And this is the first one. His first son, Shir Jashu, which means a remnant, shall return. So remember we talked about that, how the theme in chapter 7 and 8 is about Emmanuel, and it is a promise of redemption, but it's also a promise of judgment, right? So that name, like it does in oftentimes, it reflects what God is doing, it reflects the spirit of that time. And so the first name is a remnant shall return. But another way to interpret that is only a remnant shall return. So in one sense it's a promise of redemption, that despite the destruction, despite the fact that war is coming, you're going to lose, right? Paddy's going to remain, right? But another way to interpret that is because of your wickedness, because you didn't trust in God, only a remnant is going to come, right? So in one sense it is an encouragement, in another sense it is a warning of rebuke, right? And you'll see that dual nature all throughout these two chapters. Remember we talked about that last time, how judgment is coming, and how he says, remember the previous text, from before the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of His Majesty, right? When he rises terribly on the earth, so he talks about the splendor and terror in the same, and he repeats that over and over. So when God shows up, there's terror for some, and then there's splendor and glory to others. But it's the same God, right? And so we see that dual nature all throughout the text. Like God's judgment isn't that he comes and all of a sudden he does one to another, but just by his presence, some are terrified and some have hope. What does it mean to put the Lord to the test? And that was the second question. When God tells Ahaz, at the end in verse 9 it says, "If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all." And so the next verse it says, "Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, 'Ask a sign of the Lord your God, let it be deep at Sheol or high as heaven.'" So God is telling him to test me. Why is God telling him to test him? Was it wrong to test God? Don't answer it, okay? I just want you to think about it. Where in the scripture do you find where it says about testing God? It's more than one place. What does he say? Right? So in Jesus' temptation it says, "Do not test the Lord." Right? Do you remember another place where it says about testing God? Do you want to read that for us? Or just do it in summary. "Do not put your Lord to the test at the waters of Nazareth." Any place else? "In the city of Jerusalem." Okay, so that was a form of a test. So if you look at the scripture you'll find there are places in I think Numbers, Deuteronomy, where it says not to test the Lord. And then if you go, you see an example of Gideon testing God. And then we see an example in Malachi where it says to give tithe. And then it says, "Test me to see if I will bless you." Right? So we see both. In one sense it says not to test the Lord, in the other sense it says to test me. So when it says not to test the Lord, what is the meaning behind that? Basically if you look at the text of Deuteronomy and Numbers, it's prohibition against unbelief. So testing doesn't mean to try God. Testing basically means not to believe in Him. So what we see in Gideon and Malachi when it says test me, what is he saying? Basically it means trust me. Put your trust in me and you will see that my promises will be true. So testing in itself was not evil. It's what's the purpose of the test. You know how even when we ask questions there's a difference, at least I've noticed, between asking questions versus questioning. Asking questions is a genuine desire to seek an answer. Questioning is you've already made up your mind and I'm putting you to the test. There's a huge difference between the two. So the testing that is prohibited is coming to God and saying, "Hey, you're not good. Look at all of this." That's you're testing God. Where you're coming to God and saying, "Well, can I put my trust in Him? Is this a being that I can put my full confidence? I believe, help my unbelief." So in Ahaz's situation when he says, "God says to test me, what is God doing?" Just like what he was doing in the first nine verses. He's basically telling Ahaz, "Don't put your confidence in Assyria. Don't be fearful of these two stumps that are coming." If you're going to fear anything, fear me. And so he says, so he's basically pleading with Ahaz and the nation of Israel, "Test me. Ask me and I'll show you that what I'm saying is true." And how does Ahaz respond? Again, we talked about this. Here's the passages if you're writing it down or it's already there. God's giving every opportunity for him to repent but he comes and he says, "No, I don't want to test the Lord." And so if you read it superficially, it almost sounds like Ahaz is like, "Oh, I can't do that to my God. I can't test the Lord." It sounds like a man of faith but we know that that's not who he is. The fact that he already made an alliance with Assyria against the will of God already tells us where this guy's heart is. So why does he say this? It's shown clearly. So if you look at the response of verse 13, if there was any doubt that his response was not in a response of honoring God but of unbelief, Isaiah responded and he said, "Hear then, O house of David, isn't too little for you to weary men that you weary my God?" In other words, his response to God was a statement of unbelief. It wasn't just, "Oh, how can I test my Lord?" Or "How can I test God?" It was kind of, "You can't see? You can't see? How about now? How about you? You guys are okay? Alright." I'm usually short enough where everybody can see me. I'm too wide. Alright. So clearly his response was a statement of unbelief even though God is pleading with him. Again, it's not because Ahaz deserves it, it's because God loves his people. So what is the sign that he gives? He says, "Well, you're not going to ask for a sign, but I'm going to give you a sign." And this is where that promise of Emmanuel comes. And this is really interesting. I don't know if you've ever had a conversation with somebody who challenged you about the word virgin. Anybody? I mean, it's not a conversation that comes up casually. You know what I mean? I actually was out witnessing and one of the professors at UC Irvine actually brought that up to me. That word is not the word for virgin. And so I actually had to go back and study it while I was in the seminary. Despite Ahaz's unbelief, God is going to give him a sign. And that sign in verse 14 is the, again, prophecy about the virgin birth. But what's really interesting about this here is that the word used for virgin in this text is very significant because it has very specific prophecies that's going to be fulfilled immediately and later. Obviously, we know that this is a prophecy that was fulfilled in Christ. But this prophecy is also about what's going to happen immediately. So the word that is used for virgin here is a very ambiguous word. The Hebrew word is "ama," which can either be translated virgin or young woman. And this is the thing that I remember. I was out on campus witnessing and a professor came in and said, "You know the word ama doesn't mean virgin. It just means a girl." And I'm like, "Hmm." You know, I didn't take Hebrew yet, so I was just like, "No, you're wrong." I'm like, "Why?" I'll tell you why later. So there was this whole premise and I went back to school and I asked my professor and he explained this to me. So basically what's going on here is Isaiah, or God, uses the word deliberately, the word ama, that can be translated either way. So the professor would say, "No, it is not." He said, "No, it can go either way." But clearly the prophecy that goes to Jesus is translated as virgin, right? Because Matthew uses it that way and it is not wrong to use it that way because it could mean both things. The plain word for the word virgin is dula, butula, in Hebrew. Yeah, that's about it. Anything more I say is going to butcher you. Butula. There's a vowel there and I don't know how that sounds. So you're just going to have to guess. So the typical word. If the prophecy was specifically just to talk about virgin birth, the supernatural birth, that's the word that could have been used. The typical word that's used for a girl or a woman is isha. Isha. But the word that is used in the text is ama, that's kind of an ambiguous word that could go either way. The reason why this is significant is the sign that he's talking about is an immediate sign with an ultimate fulfillment that's going to come in Christ. And so the immediate context obviously is not talking about a supernatural virgin birth. The immediate context is talking about, remember we talked about three children, right? The first one is the remnants will return or only the remnant will return. It has dual meaning, right? And then the second meaning is God with us and so the future application of that is the coming of Christ, that Christ is going to come and he's going to fulfill all the promises. But immediately God with us and what does God with us mean to them? Both. He goes back and forth from judgment to restoration, judgment to restoration, right? So there's dual meaning in the context. Like God is coming, right? Or God is going to be among us because God still loves his people. So it's clear the significance is that the immediate historical application of the birth of Emmanuel can be a woman, right? This could be Isaiah's second son and we have third son mentioned in the next chapter. Some people think that maybe this was Hezekiah, right? That's an educated guess. We don't know. But the prophecy basically is he's telling Ahaz, a nation of Israel, that before this child comes and before he turns 13, that these two nations that you're afraid of, so somewhere between 13 to 15 years from now, that these two nations that you're afraid of aren't even going to exist, right? And so you're going to Assyria asking for Assyria to help you but the real fear that you should have is not these two nations. It's Assyria. What you're relying on to save you isn't really going to save you. They're going to actually come and destroy you, right? So that's basically what he's saying. And then he basically he's saying, one, you have the fear in the wrong place, right? Those two stumps. And then your confidence is also in the wrong place in Assyria, right? And then he says, I'm going to show you a sign. The sign is going to come when Jesus is going to come and all of these things are going to be nothing but then immediately his presence is going to stay with you. So in other words, that your confidence should really rely on the presence of God, right? Anything else, any other confidence that you have is going to be misplaced and eventually is actually going to destroy you, right? I mean, think about the modern application of that, right? If you have confidence in your government, confidence in money, confidence in your ability, confidence in friendship, you know, one thing that I've learned, you know, and I, you know, just in the 40 some years that I've lived is that anything that you think is a good foundation for you, right, eventually God will test all of that. Every part of it. And that's why, I mean, you see old people who aren't walking with the Lord and why they're so, I'm not saying they're all like that, but there's so many bitter and angry people. You know? Because at the end of their life, everything that they've had confidence in has been yanked out. You know? So if everything that you had confidence in is yanked out and you can't trust it anymore and you don't believe in God, what are you left with? You just become bitter, you don't trust anybody and you become isolated, right? And so basically what God is saying is that the only place and only being that you can have confidence in that won't let you down is God, right? So again, this prophecy of the Emmanuel is very significant because he's not simply talking about Christ coming, but his presence is with us at all times, right? There's an immediate application. So the question is what will happen within the time frame? He said before this child turns 13 or the age of accountability that they understood that these two nations will be gone. So in the prophecy in chapter, we're in chapter 8, right? Oh, we're not in chapter, chapter 7, 18 through 25, right? What is the reference of the fly and the bees? The fly streams and the bees may be in reference to their number and their pesky nature. Who is that in reference to? The Assyrians, right? They're going to come in and they're going to come in huge number, right? In large numbers and torment them like flies and bees. If you look at verse 18, 20, 21 and 23, it gives you, it says, "In that day the Lord will," and he said, "Here comes a judgment." Because you didn't trust in God and you put your trust in man, here comes a judgment. He said, "They will come and occupy the land in large numbers." 18 and 19. Talking about the flies and the bees, right? "They will come and disgrace men by shaving off all of the hair on their bodies." So you may have read verse 20, kind of like, "Hmm, what does that mean?" They put razor, the higher, beyond the head, beyond the river with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet and it will sweep away the beard. The reason why they use that is because at that time shaving your head was a sign of disgrace. So if you got into a battle and you lost, one of the things that they may do is to shave your head and you'll come home disgraced, right? So that's what it means, that these guys are going to come and they're going to disgrace you. And the funny thing is, and I don't know if this is connected, years ago I shaved my head when I was a youth pastor at a Korean church. And I shaved my head thinking like, "Oh, I'm going to take a vow and I'm going to pray and I'm going to seek God out." And then one of the Korean elders came up to me and he said, "Did you cheat on your wife?" That's what he asked. I was like, "What? Where did that come from?" And so I asked him, "Why do you even ask that? I'm a youth pastor." And he said, "That's what Koreans do when they do something disgraceful. It's a sign of shame." So I was reading that and I said, "Oh, that's interesting. Maybe it's in all the Asian cultures." But that's basically what this means, is that the enemies are going to come and they're going to put them to shame. Verse 21 and 22, "In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep and because of the abundance of the milk that they give, he will eat curds. For everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey." So at first it looks like, "Oh, why would that be a curse? They're going to be eating honey and curds." Basically what it means is that the land is going to become so desolate that you have these animals who are producing milk, and there's not enough people to even eat it. Typically, honey and curd was food of royalty. A common person would not be able to touch that. But what it's saying is that the land is so desolate, there's not going to be enough people to eat it. That's what he's saying. So this wasn't God saying that, "Oh, here's a blessing for you." It's a sign that the judgment is going to be complete. The land that you are now is filled with vines worth thousands of dollars, and it will be filled with people coming with bow and arrows to claim the land for themselves. Because it's desolate, you're going to have all these people who are coming to claim it by force. As a result of that, you can't even go there. It's not going to be safe. So the picture that's drawn is, he said, "They're going to come and they're going to occupy your land, like fleas and bees. They're going to come and conquer your nation. They're going to put you to shame. And then they're going to carry you off. And once they carry you off, the land is going to be desolate, and they've got all this food that you're going to be able to eat, but you can't even go to that land because all these people are coming to take it by force." And this is exactly what happens in Israel's history. His third child, Mahashalav, it means "spoils, speeds, or prey hastens." In other words, it's kind of at the end part of his prophecy about the judgment that's coming. Because they refused to trust in God, instead they put their trust in Assyria. And God comes and takes the land. And the people of Israel, they put their trust in Assyria. And God comes and pleads with them not to hold hands with Assyria. They don't listen. And as a result of that, the final judgment is that God's going to just kind of withdraw himself. Remember we talked about that last week, that God takes away the hedge, right? The kingdoms are already there about to pounce on them. The only reason why they're surviving is because God was protecting them. And so God basically is saying he's going to withdraw. And if he withdraws, then whatever happens to them is everything that happened to all the other nations is going to happen to them. So what does it mean to reject the waters of Shiloh and rejoice over Rezin and son of Ramalia? The gently flowing waters of Siloam. How do you say that in--how do you pronounce that? I don't even know how to do it in Korean. I don't know the Favre accent. That sounds like Korean. I forgot, my professor said it. It doesn't sound like the Greek. The reason why I remember it in Korean is because the Korean sounds much more like the Greek than the English does. English is--it butchers it. Anyway. I know, but I sing about this word in the New Testament. I'm just going to say it in Korean. Siloam. That probably sounds--it's probably closer to the real word. It represents the rain of Yahweh. In other words, you have this calm river where you can drink from, but then you've chosen to go with Assyria and compare Assyria to this raging water. And it may sound like it's going to--at that moment, it seems like it's going to do its job, but that you're basically playing with danger. And eventually, that thing's going to swell up, and it's going to swallow all of you. And that's the imagery that he's giving. When you go after--so put your trust in things that are dangerous, that there may be immediates of affection, but long-term, there's more danger. So he says, "Instead, Israel has chosen the wild waters of Assyria and rejoiced in the destruction of Rezend, and the son of Amalia waters will rise, and it will sweep them all away."  So as a result, again, the end part of this, what does he tell Isaiah to do or not to do? Obviously, to not--to fear man, and you will find destruction and domination from them. Fear God, and you will find Him to be your sanctuary.  Again, the dual nature of God's presence. It is a sanctuary to those who fear Him, and it is a source of danger for those who deny Him.  So obviously, for Christians, when we think about the Second Coming of Christ, we're thinking of salvation, glorification, right? But to the rest of the world, what does Second Coming mean?  Time's up, right? It says in Peter's writings, and it says, "Why isn't He coming?" People are mocking the Christians. "How come He's not coming? How come He's not coming?" Remember what Jesus says? Remember what Peter says?  Why hasn't He come? Why, after 2,000 years, has He not come?  So how is He being merciful?  To be saved, right? He's giving time for the Gospel to go out. So if He came when people were begging Him to come, you and I would not be here, right? So we're part of the reason why He didn't come in 2,000 years. Maybe there's more people that God has in store for them to come, and that's why He's not here. The only reason why He has not come yet is because He's giving opportunity for all the elect that He has appointed to come into His kingdom, right? But once that time is done and He comes, it means time's up, right? It means salvation for us, but it means judgment for everybody else. And there's more who will fall on the other side than those who are elect. So again, the dual nature of this whole thing where God is pleading with the nation of Israel to come, right? And so come because that's where salvation is. And if you put confidence in anything else, right? And that--remember the imagery that we see with Assyria? At that moment, what Isaiah was saying didn't make any sense because did Assyria help them or not? Yeah, Assyria helped them. It was because of Assyria that those two kingdoms--at least from his standpoint-- said, "What are you talking about? Assyria's going to come and destroy us. They're our friends. They're the ones who protected us. If it wasn't for them, we would have been wiped out a long time ago. You're asking us to put our confidence in God that we don't see, and here's a superpower that's willing to protect us and befriend us, and you're saying that they're going to hurt us?" It's like, "I don't see it." So what God is saying here is going against what He sees and what He's experiencing. Eventually it happens. He says that in about 65 years, you're going to see all of this. Everything that I'm prophesying is going to happen, and it's exactly what happens. It's no different now. Everything that we see is like, "Well, trust in God. If I have money, I can pay bills." So we seek for things that are tangible, but faith--faith, just like here, at the end of this first section, "If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all." And that's the theme of what He's been trying to teach the nation of Israel. So if you walk by sight, who wouldn't choose this here? These guys are just good friends. These are superpowers. If you had money problems and Mark Zuckerberg wants to be your friend, why wouldn't you befriend him? And then you have some weird prophet saying, "Don't befriend Mark." You know what I mean? Facebook is going to destroy your privacy, and it's going to ruin your friends. You know what I mean? He said, "Instead of choosing the security and having faith in God, you chose to go after the raging waters." And it may seem fun. It may seem like there's more water in the raging water than a calm stream, right? But that raging water is going to come and consume you. And it's the same thing, the same thing that God says to the nation of Israel, the same thing that He's saying to us. If you choose to walk by faith, in time you will see the fruit of that. If you choose to walk by sight and you go after whatever at that moment is going to answer your questions and pay your bills or whatever that may be, eventually the water is going to rise and it's going to consume you. He says to not deter, right? Isaiah tells the people in 8, 16, 19 not to turn to mediums or necromancers because God has hidden His face. In other words, don't turn to these things. Don't test God and say, "Well, God's not answering my prayers, so I'm not going to go somewhere else." God tells Isaiah to continue. Though Israel may be facing judgment, Isaiah vows to continue to teach the faithful and continue to hope in Him. So not only is He encouraging the nation of Israel and warning them, remember, He calls Isaiah, "Who will go for me?" and then He says, "Go to these people. They're going to hear, but they're not going to repent. They're going to harden their heart. How long, Lord, until all of this takes place?" So God turns to Isaiah and says, verse 16, 8, 16, "Bind up the testimony seal of teaching among My disciples. I will wait for the Lord who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in Him." That even in the midst of all of this and all He sees is judgment and destruction and people are not turning to God, He says to focus your teaching on the faithful, on the disciples. And so that's a vow that Isaiah takes, that even though God has chosen to hide His face from the nations, I will continue to put my trust in Him. So Isaiah becomes an example of what He's telling the nation of Israel. Judgment's coming because of your poor choices. Because of your idolatry, judgment is coming. It's inevitable, right? But He's saying the faithful, the remnant, who chooses to stick with God, is going to see better days. And so that's the warning and that's the encouragement. So if you look at God's challenge to the nation of Israel, His presence, it's not, "Here's point one, two, three, four, five. Here are things that God's going to do, here are things that God's not going to do." But in the end, when He shows up, it happens. Revival isn't when God comes and He orchestrates certain things. Revival happens when God shows up. Just like Joe, when God shows up at the end of his life, God doesn't fix everything. He doesn't say, "Oh, He went through all this." He doesn't answer any of His questions. He doesn't say, "God did this because you did this and this is going to happen. And the reason why this happened is because I wanted you to show that." He doesn't say any of that. He just shows up. And then once Joe gets a glimpse of His glory, he says, "Now I can die." Right? God was the answer. And so the judgment is, if God's showing up as the answer, the opposite of that is judgment is when God withdraws. Because our life, God created us for the purpose of declaring and to shine His glory. So when God's presence is there, His glory is shining off of us. So we automatically live because that's why God created us, to glorify God. So if God withdraws His presence, what happens to us? What's the purpose of existing? Right? It's like a computer with no electricity. It's just a box. And so that's kind of like what he's saying. His presence comes and His presence is the answer. And so he says to put your trust in Him. Not other things that you see, but in Him. All right, so I tried a little bit different so that I can kind of help you along with your questions. And hopefully that helps you answer some of the questions that you had. And again, I want to encourage you, as you guys spend some time with your small group, if you have any questions, raise your hand and I'll come and try to answer some. And then remember the sign-up thing up over here, because it's due on the 4th. It was my fault. Last week I was supposed to do it and I completely forgot. So today is pretty much the last day. So please, if you're intending to sign up, do it today. Okay.</p></div></body></html>
