Happy Lord's Day. We're going to go ahead and begin our worship service. (SINGING) I'm forgiven because you are forsaken. I'm accepted. You are condemned. I'm a loving one. Your spirit lives within me because you died and rose again. I'm forgiven. I'm forgiven because you are forsaken.</p><p>I'm accepted. You are condemned. I'm a loving one. Your spirit lives within me because you died and rose again. It's enough. It's enough. How can it be? My King would die for me. Please, Lord, I know it's true. It's my joy to honor you. You know I'm waiting. I know it's the first time I'm forgiven.</p><p>I'm forgiven because you are forsaken. I'm accepted. You are condemned. I'm a loving one. Your spirit lives within me because you died and rose again. Amazing Mother, how can it be? My King would die for me. Amazing Mother, I know it's true. It's my joy to honor you. Amazing Mother, how can it be?</p><p>My King would die for me. Amazing Mother, I know it's true. It's my joy to honor you. It's enough that I do. I honor you. It's enough that I do. I honor you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to this morning's service. If you are visiting us for the very first time, I want to extend a warm welcome to you.</p><p>When the service is done, please visit us at our welcome booth. You'll see the blue canopy out by the parking lot that you probably passed on the way in. I do have a very important announcement. Over the last several weeks, we have been hinting and communicating about the need for a third service.</p><p>We want to officially announce to you that on January 7th, the start of the new year, we're going to be implementing three services on Sunday mornings. The time for these services is going to be 8 a.m., 9.30, and 11.30 a.m. So all pretty much in the morning time. Importantly, for those of you with children, our education department at 9.30 a.m.</p><p>will have seeds, which is our nursery for the little ones, and we'll also have our sprouts ministry, but a portion, so from K through second grade. The year after that, the group will grow, but it will begin with a smaller portion of the group. The full force of the education department with the youth group, sprouts elementary ministry, and the seeds nursery will be at the 11.30 service, and so please note that that in January, we're going to start implementing that.</p><p>As you'd expect, in order to have those three services, we are going to need additional volunteers in various aspects of ministry, everything from welcome team to parking ministry, but from the parking ministry, we have a special video to encourage you to sign up, and this video is going to go down in history as a classic, so here you go.</p><p>Please enjoy. Who is that person? I see him out here every week directing traffic. You don't know? You haven't heard the stories? Should I have? There's a reason why he's always out there. And ever since that day, he's been out there every week, making sure people cross the street safely.</p><p>By himself? No one else wants to do it. All right. Well, thank you to our media team once again. You may have seen that video, and then thank you to our wonderful actors. Happy to say they're actually happily married. You know, that's proud to them getting married. That was a dramatic way of saying we're going to have various needs to sign up, so good opportunities for us to get involved there.</p><p>I do have just a couple other announcements. Please make sure that you are checking your app and the calendar. As we approach the end of the year, there are a lot of events, and including our affinity ministries, our single adults, college ministry, and family ministry, there are going to be various fellowship opportunities.</p><p>One I would like to highlight is that on December 10th, that's a Sunday, we're going to be having an all-family ministry Christmas lunch party. And so because that involves all of the family ministry, not just a portion, make sure you mark that on your calendar and sign up. There is going to be a booth outside to make that very easy for you to do so, or you can do it on your app.</p><p>Additionally, as the tail end of the year is approaching and Christmas is approaching, we do have holiday outreach opportunities. There are several that you can take a look at, again, on our website or app. One of the ones I like to highlight is Operation Christmas Child was providing a shoebox gift.</p><p>This week was the final week to submit one of those. If you took one home to fill and you still have questions about it or you need to talk to someone, please message Grace Kim. Her email is, again, available on the app and web, and then you can find out how you can submit that.</p><p>Or they have a booth outside again, and you can visit to drop off your boxes, and then they'll take that submission. For the other announcements, please make sure to, again, check. We're going to go into a time of offering, and then today we have the privilege of hearing our brother Justin King give his testimony and be baptized after our worship set.</p><p>If you have a physical check for the offering, please visit the offering box there by the entrance. Let's take a moment to pray for our service and our offering. Lord, Heavenly Father, you are so good to us and so gracious, and we appreciate from our hearts your lavishing love.</p><p>We also want to thank you that each time, each Sunday we come here to worship, what a privilege it is for us to be able to express our faith, to, Lord, connect with you, commune with the fellowship of the body, and then hear your word of instruction. So in all this, God, we praise and thank you, and it is our prayer that not only just this week, but regularly each time we give offering, that the expression of our appreciation to you would come forth and we'd be honoring in your sight.</p><p>We ask, God, that you would bless this time of service we have. The Lord may it be glorifying and exalting to you. We thank you, Lord, in Christ's name. Amen.

(Bell) Hello, I'm Justin, and I'll be giving my testimony. I've been raised going to church, so from a young age, I've known Bible stories and was aware of church culture. I knew that in order to fit in, I just had to respect my elders, sing worship songs, and memorize Bible verses.</p><p>So I attended church doing those things in attempts to convince myself and others that I was a faithful Christian. I became caught up in being known and well thought of, neglecting whether I truly believed and loved Christ. This way of living for self and feeding my pride continued all throughout middle school and high school.</p><p>I became very good at figuring out what people liked, and I strived to be well known in the world. If family and friends were impressed with dance moves, I would become a dancer. If the world started following a certain hairstyle, I would get Justin Bieber's hair. If my youth pastor told me to kiss dating goodbye, I would kiss dating goodbye in high school.</p><p>Because I'm married now, sorry. I did whatever it took to make much of myself, all the while deceiving myself and others that I was a good Christian based on my outward appearance. My destructive way of living continued until a time at retreat when I heard what Christ went through on the cross in detail.</p><p>While I've grown up hearing that Christ died because he loved me, I was shocked by the extent of his suffering. I remember thinking, "Why does a holy God become a man to die an excruciating death that was meant for criminals? What is the reason for this kind of sacrifice?" It was then that God started to slowly peel back my perception of church and the way that I was living.</p><p>While I strove to be well liked in the world and pursued what I thought would make me happy, my life was purchased and given ultimate meaning to make him known. As I continued attending my local church, studying his word, and spending time with his people, I couldn't escape the truth that following Christ looked like dying to self.</p><p>Matthew 16, 24-25, "Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.'" After being convicted through his word, I was unwilling to fully surrender to Christ and thought that I'd be able to pursue my life of sin.</p><p>Upon entering college, I joined different social clubs hoping that I'd be able to have my relationship with Christ and my sinful way of living. The Lord gave me over to my sin, and I quickly found myself looking for drugs, relationships, and alcohol to fulfill me. When I found myself in my lowest moments of intoxication and broken relationships, I began to blame God for allowing me to live this way.</p><p>I found my sinful heart becoming so lost that I accused the holy God for the sin that was within me. It wasn't until I reflected on how empty my life was that I began to repent for my sin. I lived my life actively pursuing what was right in my own eyes, and I actively rejected obedience to Christ.</p><p>Romans 5:8 writes, "But God demonstrates his own love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Feeling the weight of my sin, I cried out to God, and he forgave me. I felt immense peace in the fact that there was nothing I could do to deserve God's grace.</p><p>Concentrated by the gospel, I was able to cut off ties with all relationships that I had built for myself. I knew that my life was purchased by Christ's blood, and I no longer wanted to live for myself. Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</p><p>And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me." After I gave up all my friendships and pursuits, I continued my ministry through local church and campus ministry. I was an enemy of God, but he met me in my brokenness and disobedience.</p><p>The life I am now able to live is abundant and free. The ultimate reason for living has been given to me-- glorifying God and enjoying him forever. It is only by his grace that I am able to live in surrender and obedience. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.</p><p>Justin, I appreciate your testimony. As we enter into the water, do you understand that you symbolize your union with Christ in his death? And when you rise from the water, you realize that your life is united with Christ's resurrected life? Yes. I baptize you now in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Praise God. Please take your Bible to 1 Samuel 8. We will be taking a break from the study that we've been doing that Pastor Peter Kim has been preaching in the Gospel of Luke. We'll take a moment to pray for him as he is in Atlanta, preaching, edifying another community there for a retreat.</p><p>But here, let's read the passage that we will be studying this morning. It comes from 1 Samuel 8. I'll read the first several verses. It says, "And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judge over Israel. The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah.</p><p>They were judging in Beersheba. His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, and took bribes and perverted justice. Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. And they said to him, 'Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways.</p><p>Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.' But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, 'Give us a king to judge us.' And Samuel prayed to the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.'" Let's pray.</p><p>Father, we ask for your blessing on the reading and hearing of your Word. We pray, Father God, that it would bring to us deep conviction, that it would constantly help us to see from your perspective and your angle. We pray for Pastor Peter as he also preaches and ministers to the people through the Word.</p><p>We ask, God, that we would be given strength and boldness and clarity, that we may communicate your Word to all the people. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen. Now, just a brief note, I hope you guys are excited about the schedule change, that we're going to be having three services.</p><p>I want to also extend a thank you in advance, because we know that that's going to be a level of adjustment for all of you, right? For those of you who are here, if you try to go to the third service, then that's pretty late into the afternoon and your stomachs may growl.</p><p>Thank you in advance for being in the service time while you're, you know, typically maybe through a little bit of the lunch time. And there's going to be an 8 a.m. service, and those of you guys who normally attend at 9 a.m., you might have to go to the earlier one at 8, which means you'll have to get up earlier.</p><p>It's going to be a little bit of an inconvenience. Thank you in advance for all the adjustments that you will have to make. As you'd imagine, to make a decision like that, we went through tons of iterations and options. We had a document with just a list, a laundry list, of almost 15 different time schedules.</p><p>We even did some Internet research. We talked to friends who've had, you know, multiple service-- multiple services at their churches. Please know after a lot of deliberation, we're going to be going this way. But just for fun, I know Pastor Peter Kim in the previous week did like a quick survey, but I just wanted to see just for fun.</p><p>How many of you guys would actually consider a much later midday service? So raise your hand if you'd be down for a 1.30 start service, and then that would probably go till about 3, but that would just be kind of--you do your lunch, and then you come in for service.</p><p>How many of you guys would prefer that? Very little. Okay. Here's another fun question. How many of you guys are voting for Joe Biden next year? Oh, very--I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's a joke. I wanted to kind of tease you into a quick survey. The reason why I did that wasn't because I'm trying to get political, but because we're dropping down into a scenario in the Bible where there is in some sense a crisis of leadership.</p><p>We're dropping down into an interesting situation where the people demand a king. So I naturally thought of, oh, we are currently in a situation in our American history where the decision of who to pick for president has become incredibly intense. People have said, "You know what? Long time ago, Democrats and Republicans, they could be friends." But it seems as though the divide has become so intense that it feels like they can't be, and that's very unfortunate.</p><p>In some sense, it's just maybe people have-- their anger has become more increased over the years. Maybe people and their conflict, their social divide, people have kind of hypothesized that we live in a generation that's very easy through the Internet to have a distance enough where you can't have that kind of conflict.</p><p>That may be all true. But it may be also true that the actual issues at hand, whether it be things like abortion, border control, safety, taxation, all of these laws matter. Now, my point isn't to get into all that, although I do think that it's not thus says the Lord, but the Scripture actually has a lot to say about good laws.</p><p>So I believe it's a good, wise thing for Christians to know about what laws are in their country, what policies are fair and just, and that's just a side note. But I want to raise all this because I have a fun question for you, and that question is, what if on the ballot, on the federal level, they said, "We have a new initiative." You know, with all of this back and forth, changing of guard and administrations, having this great divide of Republicans and Democrats, we think a better solution would be to have more power in the government.</p><p>Let's go back to having a monarch. Let's have a king. Someone who could go in there and they could make changes today, not this long, drawn-out deliberation, the bill goes to the House and then the Senate and all these different places and then it gets vetoed and nothing's being done.</p><p>Let's just have a king. I'll confess to you, there were one day, there were a couple of days when I started to daydream and thought, "What if I was king?" You know, what would I do? Would I go in there and say, "You, you, you're fired." You know, and would I go in there clean house?</p><p>Would I start making implementation about policy and such? Now, I say that because when we read this passage, you saw that they were demanding a king. And I want to say, for us as believers, yes, in wisdom, we should care about what's going on in our country, but we as believers, we have a king.</p><p>The country may see us as a little bit strange because we operate as though we have the king of kings, a monarch who has actually a say into every single facet of our lives. As a matter of fact, there is no realm or dominion of my life where I have so much liberty God doesn't have his hand in.</p><p>He has his voice in everything. So in actuality, against, I guess you could even say, the liberties of American culture, we would be seen as strange. We already abide under a king. And that's going to be the main thrust of the sermon. And then I want to just give you an advance just apology.</p><p>The tone of the sermon is going to feel a little bit like frustration. And I'm going to do this motion quite a bit. What? Okay. Because we jump down into a context in which the people who already have the Lord demand a king. So let's together jump down into the context.</p><p>First, we're going to move down through the story in movements, but first we have to lay the context and the demand. And what we see actually in the context of the story is not just that everything was going fine, the people were obeying, and then the people thought, you know, it would be really great to add to our society is an amazing king.</p><p>No, the history of this nation is riddled with sin, suffering, and oppression. You can call it a vicious cycle, so much so the book of Judges has this rotating circle of incredible pain. The scripture said that the people kept on doing whatever was right in their eyes, and therefore God judged them by bringing a foreign pagan nation to come over them and oppress them, sometimes seven years, sometimes 15, sometimes even as long as 40 years of oppression.</p><p>The people would cry out in angst, "Lord, have mercy on us. Save us and deliver us." God would raise up a judge. They were not always that good. They would be delivered, they would have victory in military battles, but then they would fall over to the same sin. In that context, the scripture has actually set up a crisis moment and drama in the story because the book of Judges would repeat over and over again, and there was no king in Israel.</p><p>There was no king in Israel, and people did whatever that was right in their own eyes. That's the context. And then, so please read with me verses 1 through 3 of 1 Samuel 8, and what we find is that there are plenty of excuses. What do I mean? Verse 1, "And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.</p><p>Now the name of his son, firstborn, was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judging in Beersheba. His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice." The first excuse that people could have for why they made this demand was that Samuel, the great judge, Samuel was essentially set up as the last judge of Israel before the kings.</p><p>He's getting old now, and in similar ways, when the leader is old, we start feeling this level of diminishing confidence. It's not the same having a young man with gusto and passion wanting to go and conquer or having this vibrancy, but rather you have an individual who is soon to pass.</p><p>That was their first excuse. Samuel, you're old. Excuse number two, Samuel essentially took his sons--my guess is that he had his sons be with him when he was giving the judgments, when he was making decisions, giving counsel, all that kind of stuff, and in some sense, there's always a risk.</p><p>He placed his sons as judges. The position of judge is not like kingship. It doesn't happen where, "Oh, since you're the son of the king, you're the prince next to the throne." That's not how judges work. They're appointed by God. Through the previous judge, they're appointed, and he set up his sons.</p><p>The excuse was, "Man, Samuel, your plan failed. You set up your sons, and they are now wicked." I just want to make a side point. In some sense, each and every single one of us is susceptible to this temptation. We have to be incredibly careful with leadership and authority.</p><p>Why? Because it corrupts. Power corrupts. We're not so strong that if we had the authority and the power and the backing of God behind us, that we would not use our authority for our own gain. In our day today, we have that. Are there politicians who use their power, position, and authority for selfish gain?</p><p>We even see it in leadership positions at church. We see it perhaps in our workplaces. People are susceptible to this kind of sin. Yes? But then when that happens, the reason why I bring it up is the people suffer. The unmentioned excuse is if they are being taxed this way, if the people are under bad leadership, what ends up happening is they suffer.</p><p>And so not only in this situation, but in many situations before, the nation, the people would say, "The priests you have set up, they keep demanding the best. They say it's for God, and then they take it home. The priests are essentially leeching off of us." And so the unspoken excuse is, "Samuel, not only are you old, but your sons are untrustworthy.</p><p>We have been suffering under this." And so with those excuses, they demand a king. Within that, what would you say? If you were Samuel and you were giving advice, would you say, "Yeah, I know," because you feel guilty that it was your decision that caused this? Would you say, "I know, I get it, I get it, it's hard." May I give you a reminder that to us, yes, there are reasons, and maybe legitimate reasons, sometimes to have a desire to have some false solution, but excuses are excuses for a reason.</p><p>To us, there is no legitimate excuse to doubt God Almighty. There is no legitimate excuse to go and doubt the king. Here, the way we should read it is, "Samuel was old, and therefore they stopped trusting God. The nation had two sons who were bad judges, and therefore they lost sight of the king." Why is that even an excuse?</p><p>This is bogus to think that because we had two judges who were young, and they were corrupt, and they were after dishonest gain, let's go ahead and give more power to another man. It's so humanistic. It's so humanistic. And so by way of conviction, we realize this is an absolutely foolish demand.</p><p>What in the world are you asking when you already have a king? And so the people say to Samuel, "Appoint us a king who will judge us like all the nations." That's verse 5. And I'm still trying to set up the context for you, but now we look at this foolish demand, and in just that short sentence that the people raise up to Samuel, we get two things.</p><p>Not only do we get, yes, they're looking humanistically to a man who would have power, but it also tells us why. What is the reason? Well, first, when we think of what is it they want, they say in an interesting and strange way, "Appoint us a king who will judge us." We don't normally talk like that, right?</p><p>"Give us a president. In our next term, we have to have a president who's going to judge me. I want him to evaluate me and tell me what I did wrong. I want him to give critical analysis and constructive criticism so I can be better." Is that what he's saying?</p><p>No. What they want is one who's a ruler. If you want somebody who's a judge, you want that person to institute laws. You want that person to represent you. You want that person to fight for you. Isn't that what we want? And in a sense, what that means is we want to set up our own laws, because these people already have their laws.</p><p>Don't you guys have the Torah? They want their own policies. They want their own way. Why? Because they want to be like the other nations. They say it. "We want to be like the other nations." And then you realize, "What in the world? Why would you want to be like the other nations?</p><p>You're the people of God," for crying out loud. You have your own identity. Why in the world would you like the other nations? If you meditate on it, could it be? Could it be precisely because God wanted His nation to be different? In what way? God wanted His nation, in some sense, comparative to the other nations, to be small.</p><p>You are a small people. God wanted His army to be small. You have a small army. Do you remember the story of Gideon? He gathered all these armies of God, and they were about to go into battle, and God said, "You know what? I want you to dwindle that down." "Really?</p><p>Are you going to be with us?" "You know what? Since you said that, I want you to dwindle it down even more." Why? Because they're a nation with a mighty king. They're not a nation with a huge army. They're a nation with a mighty Lord. And maybe just for that very reason, the nation of Israel completely lost sight of that and said, "Dude, that nation over there, that huge army, we want a king that will build us an army." You know what else?</p><p>That nation over there has a huge cattle. This nation, our nation, the nation of Israel, we've got to sacrifice lambs, cows, birds, every time we sin, every year on Yom Kippur, and more. But look at them. So many. So prosperous. They wanted to be like the other nations. They wanted to look like them.</p><p>They wanted to have their own laws. And all of that was an absolute rejection of God. And so for us, imagine if you were Samuel, what would you say to these people who are demanding a king? Turn your Bibles over to Leviticus chapter 20, verse 20-24. How shall we respond to this?</p><p>I'm going to read a little larger portion here. In Leviticus 20, verse 20-24, God's going to talk about His law and His intent, and He has said it so clearly. He says, "You, therefore, are to keep all My statutes and My ordinances and to do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out.</p><p>Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nations which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them." What? You want to be like the nations that God hates? Clearly, God is not in their consideration. Verse 24, "Hence I have said to you, you are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p><p>I am the Lord your God." God is the provider. He's going to deliver the land. He's going to make them successful. He's their warrior. So then, verse 26, "Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy, and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine.</p><p>Likewise, you and I, we are told in the New Testament, do not be conformed to this world. This world will tell you all sorts of things that you need, you must have. Don't be conformed by that." You know, there was a thing I did see when I was looking at news, when I was looking at who people are selecting for their president and stuff.</p><p>I have seen in years where there's an election, people cry and weep because their candidate didn't win. I have seen people literally bawl. Why? Because it felt like their warrior was dead. And I have seen people on the other side, their president wins, and they're elated. They'll go out in the streets.</p><p>It looks like they're riding, but they're just celebrating. They're high-fiving strangers. They're just elated to have their king win. In some sense, that's a strange conformity to this world. It would be eerie for a Christian who has a king to behave like the world. Now, this is the exact point I want to make.</p><p>We're going back to this idea that the nation was complaining, but Samuel is old. There's a crisis. There's like unrighteousness. All true. And what's more, there isn't any kind of plan for the future. What are we supposed to do? And then their idea was, then set up this king.</p><p>But as you recall, this would be entirely wrong because God has said, "I've always been on the throne." Take your Bibles to Isaiah 6, and God is going to say with emphatic vision, "You always have the king." In Isaiah 6, this is where we get many of our songs of "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord." And what actually is the scenario is that it's the year of King Uzziah's death.</p><p>Eventually, King Uzziah's son will become king, but he's not a very good king. As you know, the history of the Israelites, there are many kings who are absolute dunce. So then, in the year of King Uzziah's death, he says, "I saw the Lord sitting on the throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe, filling the temple." And then turn your eyes to later down in verse 5, and then he said, "Then I said, 'Woe is me!</p><p>I am ruined, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I live amongst a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the king.'" And God is going to say emphatically to these people who make this request, "Give us a king who's going to make good laws for us.</p><p>Give us a king who's going to represent us and fight for us." He's going to say, "But I'm still on the throne." Jot this down as it passes. Isaiah 33, verse 22. The Lord says that He is our judge. The Lord is our lawgiver. The Lord is our king, and He will save us.</p><p>You know, the people, the nation of Israel is interesting because there are so many times when they forcibly try to make people king. They're totally walking by sight and not by faith, and they try to push mighty warriors into kingship. A passage in Judges 8, verses 22-23, it says that the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your son, also your sons' sons, for you have delivered us from the hand of the Midians." As soon as he said that, the answer is, "Wrong." Gideon was a nervous wreck.</p><p>Gideon did not know. Gideon, yes, he's a good warrior, but remember, he's the guy who's like, "God, are you really going to go with us? How are we supposed to know? You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put out this fleece, and if it's wet, then I know you're going to be with us." In some sense, he was filled with doubt, anxiety, and fear, but he followed the Lord.</p><p>And so the story is not that, "Oh, Gideon, good job. You delivered us." Wrong. God used you. God delivered us. And so look what Gideon says, verse 23, "But Gideon said to them, 'I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the Lord shall rule over you.' When they said, 'You, your sons, and your sons after, rule over us,' they wanted a king." Gideon knew exactly what they were asking for, and so he said, "No, it's not me.</p><p>You have a king. I hope I did a good job belaboring this point with you. You have a king, you have a king. You have a fighter, you have the warrior in God." Why? Because this is a unique passage in our story here in 1 Samuel 8 where God tells us how He feels about this demand.</p><p>And I wanted you to feel it, the frustration, the audacity, the ridiculousness of it all. If you take a look, going back to 1 Samuel 8, now we're going to move to the next portion of the movement of the story, God's word on the matter. Chapter 8, verse 7-9, this is what the Lord says, "Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for," look at this, "they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</p><p>Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt, even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they are doing to you also." Brothers and sisters, that is like a sad statement. To have God evaluate and summarize their journey since the days of Egypt, this is hundreds of years now, since the days of Egypt to this very moment, God says, "You know what?</p><p>This has been the same old story. You keep rejecting me. That's tragedy." And then God tells us, "This is incredible offense of repeat rejection. You disregard God's laws. You want somebody to judge over you, to make your laws and your policies, while I have already given you the Torah, I've given you the Ten Commandments, I've given you good instructions." Later on, the kings and queens of the world will look at the nation of Israel and say, "Oh my gosh, you have a God who gave you this?</p><p>You have protections for the poor, you have provisions for the weak. You have a God who gave you this good law?" But instead, they're going to say, "Nope, we want our own." What offense for God who provides, God who fights. Scan your eyes down to verse 19, chapter 8, verse 19.</p><p>God gives them warning, "Do you have any idea what you're asking for? It's going to ruin you." And then it says, "Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel. And they said, 'No, but there shall be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, that our king may judge us.'" And then he adds, "And go out before us and fight our battles." What?</p><p>We should feel how offensive this is. You want men to go fight your battles? I have a montage of passages for you to show you just how ridiculous this demand is. Exodus chapter 14, verse 13 through 14. In Exodus 14, Moses said to the people, "Do not fear. Stand by and see the salvation of the Lord, which we'll accomplish before you today.</p><p>For the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again." Why? "The Lord will fight for you while you keep silent." You're walking? You're not shouting? "But God is going to win the battle for you and deliver them all into your hands." Deuteronomy chapter 3, verse 22.</p><p>"So do not fear them, for the Lord your God is the one fighting for you." This next one is important. Deuteronomy chapter 1, verse 30 through 35. In Deuteronomy chapter 1, verse 30 through 35, "The Lord your God, who goes before you, will himself fight on your behalf, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes.</p><p>And in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place. But for all this, you didn't trust the Lord your God, who goes before you on your way to seek out a place for you to camp, in the fire by night and cloud by day, and to show you the way in which you should go.</p><p>So the Lord heard the sound of your words, and he was angry and took an oath, saying, 'Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good which I swore to give to your fathers.'" Oh my goodness. God saw himself as a father. How horrible is this?</p><p>He saw himself as their warrior, as their deliverer. He went before them, he covered them with cloud, with fire. He prepared the place they should inhabit. And then for them to be like, "Yeah, I don't know, we don't trust you." This is horrendous. I want you to imagine with me the sheer feeling of rejection, by imagining a ridiculous scene.</p><p>Imagine you're a parent of a young child. He's just seven years old, he's in the elementary department. And in the morning you decide, "You know what, we're going to get up together, and then we're going to get ready, and we're going to take you there." So early in the morning you get him up, and he's got his hair all bed hair, so you have to spray his hair, you comb your hair.</p><p>He gets all dressed, but it's all wrinkly and ugly, so you go, "Oh, you can't wear that." And so you put him in Sunday's best. He tries to head out, but he didn't eat yet, so you make the eggs, you make the bacon, and you feed him, you give him milk.</p><p>And then he can't even tie his own shoes, so you're like, "Like fish, you make the loopy loop, and you put it together." You bring him into the education department, and there's a new volunteer he doesn't know, and he goes, "Oh, who are you? Who are your parents?" And he looks up, and he goes, "I have no parents." How would you feel?</p><p>And then so the volunteer worker, our dear teacher, he's like, "Oh, come on. Who are your parents, right? Stop messing with me." And he goes, "Yeah, I have parents, but no one really loves me at my house." How would you feel as a father? How would you feel as a mother?</p><p>What did you say? Right? What is going on right now that you would say that? Like it's flabbergasting. Like I don't understand what just happened here. Why would you say that? Why would you sit there, be dropped off by your parents, and then say, "I have no parents"? That's literally what happened.</p><p>You were delivered, you were carried, he carried you on his back, and then he dropped you off into a good promise land flowing with milk and honey, and then you go, "Give me a king," as though you don't have one. How could you do that to him? That's the tone here.</p><p>How could you do that to God Almighty? What am I hearing? And so I want to remind us by way-- it's flabbergasting because they would have to be so blind, so self-consumed, and I want to remind us by way of application. Our enemy wants to blind us that much.</p><p>"Your God's not here for you." That's what he says. "Your God's not here for you, so that's why you need this." And ever since you were young, our enemy, the world, wants to convince us, "Oh, you need--you need, you know, an Ivy League degree. You need a proper job.</p><p>You need this person. You need that person. You need this and this," and then it gets frivolous. "Oh, you need to do makeup. You needed to do this. You need to wear that." And then you have these car companies like, "Around here, you got to love what you drive." "No, I don't." You know, I teach my young children to not say certain words because it's too harsh.</p><p>They're not allowed to say, "Shut up," to each other. But in rare circumstances, you should be able to do it. If a young child looks his parent in the eye and says, "I have no parents," you could tell that child, "You need to shut up." How dare you? Very offensive, right?</p><p>What's more, for you and I, if the world keeps telling us, "You have to have this," who said? My God said, "He's my all in all." Who is telling me that I need that? It's not God. If somebody tells you, "You have to be here. You have to live there.</p><p>You have to have this person," and this world is chock full of overly romanticized, like, "I can't live without this girl. I have to have this man in my life." Who said that? My God said, "You are complete in Christ." My God said, "You have a King." My God said, "He provides for you.</p><p>He sees after you're going in and coming out, and He watches you over everything to such a degree we see the Lord is my shepherd. I will have no want." And yet the world keeps telling us, "No, no, no." And that's what got into the people's heart. We've got to be like them.</p><p>We're falling behind. It's so dangerous because the incredible ridiculousness of what they're saying they did not see, and they were relentless in demanding it. I want to give you another thought by way of application is you don't really have to say, "You know what, God? I hate you. You know what, God?</p><p>You're a horrible father." You do not have to say those things to offend Him deeply. Some of you guys are complainers. You're just a Debbie Downer, as they say. You're just grumbling. "Oh, my gosh, life is so hard. No one loves me here. This church stinks. My family stinks, and my work stinks." And you're just constantly looking for the next job, the next family, the next group of friends.</p><p>Mind you, when you keep saying that, God, your provider, is on their side like, "What's going on here? What's happening?" Another example. This idea of God being your king and your provider, your protector, your warrior, it has applications everywhere. Some of you are just raw with worry. "Oh, my gosh, I'm never going to make it.</p><p>Oh, my gosh, what's going to happen?" You're just scared. You can't do things. Sometimes when I counsel, you know what one of the most often heard things, little statements are? "I can't." "Oh, I want you to go and reconcile with God." "I can't." "You know, I want you to go step out and try." "I can't." There were some times when I thought about, "What do I say to somebody who is so fearful like that?" Do I say something all silly like, "No, you can do it." You know, like, "What am I supposed to do?" What I want to say to them now is, "But you have a king.</p><p>Don't you have the Almighty in your life? Why do you act like nobody is on your side? And it's not going to help you to be like, 'I'm here for you. I'm your pastor.'" Like that's not going to help you. You have the Lord of Lords, Christ who is going to rule with an iron scepter.</p><p>He's going to come with blazing eyes of fire and with a word he's going to slay. You have a king. And what's more, sometimes we have people who struggle deeply with like, "I don't know if I have a purpose. I don't know what I'm living for. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing." And then so they just describe like, "What's the use?" No motivation, no gusto, no passions.</p><p>They go home, they play video games and just wasting their time. What? You have a king. At what point did this king stop being king? When you leave this place, you leave church, you leave the service, you leave the fellowship, and you walk into your house, you walked into his domain.</p><p>That's his. You're on his time. You're under his rule. And you have an incredible purpose to live for your king. Why do people act like there's no king? We have marching orders. We have everything in this king. And so I want to remind us there is so much writing here in just the fact that these people lost sight of the one who's on the throne.</p><p>And then as a final reminder, I want to give you this sobering reminder that if we keep complaining, if we keep griping, if we keep in fear, if we keep in discouragement, and if we keep in lackadaisical like, "Yeah, I don't know." At some point, God is going to say, "Okay, is that what you want to live by?" Here, more specifically for this nation, they saw the other nations and they're like, "Oh my goodness, look at them." Is that really what you want?</p><p>You want to be under their care? You do realize one of the scariest things comes to us from Scripture. It doesn't initially sound scary, but it is. God says, "Then have it." God says, "You want that reward? Then that's all you get." If you think about it, that's one of the scariest things.</p><p>God is holding our lives. He says He sustains everything. He prevents things from going into complete chaos. He prevents things from going into this vicious cycle to arrive at the pit of the bottom. For God to say, "I release you," it's a frightening thing. It really is. And what's more, God is going to warn us.</p><p>And when you realize and you look up and you say, "Oh my gosh, we didn't want this. Our king is horrible," He's going to say, "I will not hear you." In the New Testament, in Romans 1, God says, "You knew just enough. You knew just enough to look over and you knew I was paternal, you knew I was powerful, but you traded it." What does He say?</p><p>He says, "So I'll give you over to your depraved mind. You want to commit to your lust? Then have it. You want to commit to your whims? You're going to set your own beliefs, your own rules, and your own laws? Then have it." That is such a scary place to be, brothers and sisters.</p><p>What God does in the next movement in the story is just that. Go over back to 1 Samuel 8, verses 9 and 10. And this is what the Scripture says. God gave Samuel orders to listen, to warn, and then to give it. So in 1 Samuel 8, 9, He says, "Then listen to their voice.</p><p>However, you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedures of the king who will reign over them." And that reads kind of funny. And I will say, just as a side note, please don't think, "Oh yeah, this is what I should do." If you're parents in here, this is not to be like, "Yeah, you know what?</p><p>My kids want that candy." Well, you want it? Then have it and just like shove it in their mouth, you know? God in His infinite fatherly wisdom is testing them. God in His infinite sovereignty and His prerogative is giving to them their just dessert. But part of His heart is being revealed because He says, "Solemnly," and it's very emphatic.</p><p>It's like a strange wordplay where He just repeats the same thing in a beautiful way three times. What He says is, "Warning, you shall warn and speak." That's the literal way that it reads. "And inform them the consequences by telling them the procedure of the king," and that reads funny too.</p><p>The way we should understand that is, tell them exactly how this is going to play out. If God's giving you warning, He is being so real with you, He says, "Tell them what the future holds." And so let's walk through that together. Starting from verse 10, He says, "So Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king." He said, "This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you.</p><p>He will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots among his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots." Whoa. That king, when you set him up and give him power, he's going to have your sons fight in his battles, and some of your sons will be like bumper cars.</p><p>Some of your sons will be the bumper for his car. He's going to put them in front of his chariot. Verse 12, "He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and some to do his plowing and reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war the equipment for his chariots." He's going to make people fight his battles all for his own benefit to do his work and bidding.</p><p>Verse 13, "He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants." And you're thinking, "Oh my gosh, it's like taxation right now." Well, he mentions it later, "He will take a tenth of your seed and all your vineyards and give to his officers and his servants." He's going to take a tithe.</p><p>"He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work. He will take a tenth of your flock, and you yourselves will become his servants." You're going to become his slaves. You thought he was going to provide for you?</p><p>Who is he? Who is this man? Give us a king. Oh really, who? It's ridiculous. And he tells you the future. You're going to give that much trust, that much power to a man instead of God? You're going to rely on one who is feeble? There's internal conflict in every man.</p><p>We're battling our selfishness. Give him power. That battle is so hard to win. Watch what he says, verse 18. "Then, once you realize, then you will cry out in that day because your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you in that day." That's what he says in warning.</p><p>The king, who is a greedy man, will become your oppressor. And he's going to do all of these crazy things. If you observe what those things are, it sounds like a person who thinks he is God. Right? It sounds like a person who thinks he is the focal point of why these creatures remain.</p><p>It's a man who thinks he is at the pinnacle top. That's why when God says, "Do you understand what you're doing? You are rejecting me. And just as you have always done, you reject me to serve other gods." Don't think, "Oh, yeah, we just have these political preferences and ideas, etc, etc." There are forms of government that exist now and here that sound like we want a God.</p><p>I get disturbed when I hear political pundits. We've got candidates saying, "You know what we need is? America needs spiritual healing. I'm going to unite all of us together." I'm like, "Uh-uh. You ain't my God. You're not Jesus." But you hear them talk like that. "We need to have a revival." I've heard people say that.</p><p>"We need to have a revival. We've lost our identity. I'm going to give to us a sense of identity and purpose. We need all the..." Who are you? Who do you think you are? I don't see you that way. That's what I want to say to them. I talk to my TV screen sometimes.</p><p>I don't see you that way. You know why? I have a king. Thank you very much. Thanks, but no thanks. I have a king. And my king is good. Amen? My king is perfect. I don't trust you that much. My king I trust wholeheartedly. He's trustworthy. He has never failed me.</p><p>And he is patient with me. It's strange to me when I hear people talk about the grand old visions they have of political ideologies. Again, I don't mean to get into all that, but I don't know if some of you guys are fans of socialism. But socialism essentially is kingship in multiple forms.</p><p>If you have a government that is king, that's socialism. They're going to provide for you. They're going to collect all your goods. And then they're going to distribute it so that everybody has an equal share. Bogus. No king has ever done that. No king body will ever do that.</p><p>Who can do that? That's our God. But after all of this warning, their hearts are so set. Take a look at 1 Samuel 8:19-22. 1 Samuel 8:19-22 says, "Nevertheless," this is so sad, you guys, "the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, 'No!' But there shall be a king over us." I just, I can't imagine God hearing that.</p><p>After he gives them the warning, like, I know the future. Let me tell you exactly how it's going to be, and they say that. Verse 20, "That we also may be like all the other nations, that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p><p>Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the Lord's hearing. The Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen to their voice. Appoint them a king.' So Samuel said to the men of Israel, 'Go, every man, to his city.' When I read that, I cried." What, question, what do you think God should say to these people, right?</p><p>The reason why I cried is because the impression that I got with was, "Okay, the scariest thing happened. God is done with them. Go, go home." And rightly so, what would you say? Thank goodness I am not God, but if I were, I would say, "I'm done. I've had it with you guys.</p><p>This is the last time. That's enough. That's enough out of you. All this complaining, all this griping, every time I let you pray to me, that's all you have to say? I deliver you, I protect you? Why do I have to be the dummy here? Am I a dunce?</p><p>Do I have to keep reaching out like this, like, 'Hello, hello, hello?' I'm God. Why do I have to ever, even once, feel your rejection? Forget you." Because I falsely thought, when he said, "Go home," like every man went to his city, I cried. Because then they're done. We're done.</p><p>Because we foolishly look to so many things for our protection, provision, and grace, and we forget we have this lovely King. But as you know, our King is good. Amen? Turn your Bibles over to 1 Samuel chapter 12. I think it's appropriate to say that it is fitting for God to be done with His people.</p><p>It is fitting for God to have such an annoyance and frustration to say, "I don't want to deal with you anymore." But God reveals His heart in the midst of this great rejection. And look at what it says. 1 Samuel chapter 12. Samuel is speaking to the people, and he says, "Well, when you saw in Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us.'" I'm sure he didn't say it like that, but I'm just saying, putting some...</p><p>"You shall have a king, although the Lord your God was your king. Now therefore, here is the king you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the Lord has set a king over you, so you got what you asked for," he says. Verse 14. "If you will fear the Lord and serve Him, and listen to His voice, and not rebel against the command of the Lord, then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God.</p><p>If you will not listen to the voice of the Lord, and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you, as it was against your fathers. But even now..." Say what? "But even now." That means you have a second chance.</p><p>That means you still have time. Take your stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes. Is it not wheat harvest today? Is it not time? He said, "I'll call the Lord, that He may send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the Lord by asking yourself for a king." So Samuel called to the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day.</p><p>And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. Then all the people said to Samuel, "Oh, please pray for your servants to the Lord your God, so that we may die, for we have added to all of our sins this evil by asking for ourselves a king." Pause there.</p><p>Amen. They start to kind of get it. But honestly, it's kind of. I don't want to be too harsh on the nation of Israel because we are such. In many ways, we're the same. But when they say, "Oh, pray for your servants." Oh, really? And when were you acting like good servants?</p><p>Anyway, I'm just being bitter. But what they say is, "We did sin." But just as a side note, when we repent to God, maybe repent thoroughly. If you cling to your idol and you say, "God, God, I'm so sorry. I added to my sin," and then you just cuddle your idol, that's not repentance, is it?</p><p>That's not repentance. But look at what the Lord says. That's for another sermon, but look at what the Lord says, okay? "And Israel, speaking, said to the people, 'Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.</p><p>You must not turn aside, for then you would go after futile things, which cannot profit or deliver because they're futile.'" We want kings and futile things. We want stuff that looks all fancy, but they never deliver. They're always going to bust. And we have friends that we love. It's like, "Oh, my gosh, why do you want that?</p><p>It's only going to hurt you in the end. Why do you keep going down that path?" And it's the same frustration here. But verse 22, "For the Lord will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the Lord has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.</p><p>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you. But I will instruct you in the good and right way." That's amazing, isn't it? Praise God. If the story ended with, "Yes, you have sinned," period, it could have ended just there.</p><p>But the heart of our king, it's so good, isn't it? He says He loves us. And what's more, on the account of His own great name, by the account of His own good pleasure, our king's will is perfect. It's perfect towards us. Praise God that I am not the Lord, I am not God, and I'm not His counselor.</p><p>Because guess what? If I was His counselor, I would have advised Him differently. I would have said, "Hey, you know this relationship you have with these people? How long have you been doing the same thing, expecting different results, huh? How about you leave?" I would have counseled Him otherwise.</p><p>Why? He's incurring too much. But praise the Lord that we have a king who persists with us. Praise the Lord who provides us everything. Amen? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, You are the good Father who carried Your people, and we know that You sustain us now and today. Lord God, we confess sometimes we have no idea what we're asking for.</p><p>Sometimes we think some things are so good and we want it so bad, and we want it now. Lord, we confess, God, that those are just foolish things we say in our ignorance. But what we know for certain is, God, that with You there is assurance. With You there is provision, power, strength, and more.</p><p>So, God, we thank You, and we praise You as our king. Help us to learn what it means to walk our day as those who truly have the king of the universe in our midst, inside of our hearts, inside of our minds, and by faith that we dwell with You, so that, God, we will live this life with power.</p><p>It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's all rise together. Created one, the author of salvation, Who fought the laws of space and time, And fashioned worlds to His design. The One who made your host reveal, Hung the stars like chandeliers, Now burn every grain of sand, Knows the heart of every man.</p><p>He is King forever. The fortress and our strength, The rock on which we bend the end, Is gracious to His majesty. His power and authority's unshaken. Unshaken by the sins of man, Never changing, here I am. Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall, His faithful unit all. Crown Him King forever.</p><p>Immortal flesh, Forsaken by a traitor's curse, The curse of sin and centuries, Did pierce full, holy Prince of Peace. Lift it up! Lift it high, as to the sky, Crucified, the Son of Man, Buried by the sons of man, Rescued by the Mother's hand, To reign as King forever.</p><p>Reign as King forever. Reign as King forevermore. Eternal God of grace, We crown You with the highest praise. Sharks and saints adore, Your holy, holy, holy, One joy, one joy, One joy everlasting, All is love and good beside. Justice rolls and praises rise, At the Name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>King of Kings forever. Gracias. King of Kings forever. Now let's pray together. Our God, thank You. This morning we are reminded that our citizenship is with You, underneath Your great reign. Lord, it is our prayer that You would help us walk each day that is different. Help us walk differently from the world, for we have such hope in the eternity that You provide, under Your grace and mercies.</p><p>And so I ask God that in the way that we live each day, from down to each worry, down to each issue or problems we face, God, we know that we walk with the King. And so now, may the love of God the Father, the everlasting grace of Christ our Savior, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you now and forever.</p><p>Amen. God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus. He came to do love, heal and forgive. He lived and died to buy my pardon. An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives. Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. Because He lives, all fear is gone. Because I know He holds the future and life is worth the living just because He lives.</p><p>Spoke Your name into the night, and through the darkness, Your loving kindness saw through the shadows of my soul. The work is finished, the end is written.</p></div></body></html>
