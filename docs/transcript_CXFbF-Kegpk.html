Thank you. in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of his covenant between me and the earth, and it shall come about when I bring a cloud over the earth, and the bow will be seen in the cloud.</p><p>That's where we get rainbow, right? At least in the Bible, it's not one word, right? It was a bow that was created by the rain, so it's rainbow, right? And then Genesis 9, 16, 17, when the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all the flesh.</p><p>And God said to Noah, this is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth. Okay? So let me ask you again. He says, when it rains, and you see the bow, right? The rainbow, or bow of the rain, right?</p><p>I will not destroy the earth like I did in chapter 7 and 8. So what is the purpose of this rainbow? why does he give this covenant to them? Because we know judgment is coming, right? Think like you are Noah and his descendants. What would that rainbow mean to you?</p><p>Let me ask you again, because I want you to do some critical thinking, okay? What would that covenant, when you see the rain coming, and you see the, you see the rainbow, what would that mean to you if you just experienced the flood? Huh? Mercy? What would it have done?</p><p>If you didn't see that, and every time it rains, what would it do to you? Where is the boat? Right? We got some holes. Get the animals back on the boat. Right? Every time it rains. Because just the whole earth got wiped out. Right? But rain is necessary. So he says, every time it rains, you're going to, when you see the bow, this is a reminder to you that I will remember my covenant, this is not going to happen again.</p><p>How can you possibly live? Right? You can't live. I mean, we're so many years removed from that. The flood is, it actually happened? Is this real? Right? But imagine if it actually happened to you. Imagine if you were a flood, you survived the flood. You're going to, you're going to move away as far as you can from any body of water.</p><p>Right? Because you're afraid that, that you experienced tsunami, so you don't go to the beach anymore. But the thing is, the earth needs rain to live. So he says, every time it rains, God's going to put a rainbow on there to remind you, right, that your confidence is not going to come because you're measuring the rain.</p><p>Your confidence comes because God said, I will remember. Right? That's what the, that's what the rainbow was for, is to give us peace. Right? And confidence, so that we can live based upon God's promise. And then they turned it into what it is today. So when you see a rainbow today, what does it remind you of?</p><p>Obviously. Right? Yeah, the gay community, they, they perverted that. Now, as sick as that is, that's basically, that's basically a sign of mankind. That every good gift that God has given, mankind spit, spit on it. He didn't just disobey. Mankind turned it into something, right? So perverted. Right? But it's not just a rainbow.</p><p>We pervert marriage. We pervert sex. We pervert leadership. Right? We pervert masculinity. We pervert femininity. We pervert work. Every good thing God gives us to remind us of him, mankind not only rebels against it, but perverts it. Right? There's other covenant symbols that God has given us. Circumcision as a covenant symbol of Abraham and Israel.</p><p>Right? Every time that they circumsigned the child, it was an act of dedication that this child belongs to God, part of Israel. The Sabbath, every time they observed Sabbath, was to get alongside them and to remember, remind themselves of the covenant relationship. And the reason why they had to constantly remind themselves of the covenant relationship is because they were constantly living in danger.</p><p>Right? it was a reminder to them that God is with them. And that's what the covenant symbol was for. So we go to the New Testament. Baptism is a covenant symbol of our union with Christ. So when we get baptized, we are dead in Christ. We arise with Christ.</p><p>And so everything that happens in life now is because we're united with Christ. So if you are a child with God who is united with Christ, everything that happens to you happens in the context of Christ in the middle. Right? So if you really think about what that covenant symbol is for a Christian, is that, and I mentioned, I don't know if I mentioned it here, but just like the disciples, when they're on that boat and they think it's going to sink.</p><p>Right? They think it's going to sink. But Jesus is on that boat. And so they say, we're going to die, we're going to die. Jesus wakes up, remember what he says? You of little faith. Right? Why are you afraid when I am with you? Right? So no matter what happens in this life, the covenant symbol that God has given us is a reminder to us that whatever happens in your life, Christ is in the middle.</p><p>So that covenant symbol is to give us peace, to remind us of God's promise. It reveals God's nature and it gives us eternal security in Christ. Right? So Hebrews 6, 17, 19, in the same way, God desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose interposed with an oath so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.</p><p>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and which enters within the veil. So that's what the covenant symbol was for, is to fulfill this, Hebrews 6, 17, 19, so that we can live with confidence that what God promised he will do.</p><p>And that's why he says the word remember is so important. If God said it, he will fulfill it and you can bank on it so that we can anchor our souls on this. And the covenant symbol, symbols are to remind us of this. What exactly was Ham's sin? And I'm, for the sake of time, I'm not going to go too deep into it.</p><p>Basically, he covered his father's nakedness and dishonored him. Now some have argued that Leviticus chapter 18 talks about, you know, the uncovering his nakedness. Is this possibly talking about some sexual act with his mom, right, or with Noah's husband? But the word for uncovered and saw here is different.</p><p>And if you look at the context, right, and I'm not going to go too deep into this. if you look at the context of the brothers walking backward, right, to hide him and then him coming and telling him, telling the brothers about what he saw, that it most likely isn't that if you somehow read that.</p><p>Okay. I started this years ago and I forgot, but there is some, one of the views is that, but I don't think it is, so, and it is not a popular view. Most people believe that it is not. It's just what you see, right? He saw his father's nakedness and instead of covering him up, he revealed his shame.</p><p>And that was the curse that led to his line being cursed, the Canaanites, right? And the next question is, why is Canaan mentioned instead of him? And I think one of the practical reasons why is because Moses is writing this right before he conquers Canaan. Right? So this is justification of what's happening.</p><p>Right? Now, I'm going to, this is going to come with the question, your discussion question, because honoring your father and mother is huge in the Bible. If a child rebels against the parents, what happens? in the Old Covenant, was it a covenant? He gets stoned to them. There was no tolerance for teenage rebellion.</p><p>Right? In our generation, it's almost like, oh, it's a teenager. Oh, they have, that's what they do. It's because we've accepted it. Right? And it's part of the fall. But he said, the Bible tells us it's that dangerous. When you, when you see children rebelling against their parents, something has seriously gone wrong because the order that God has created, if a child rebels against parents, right, then he's going to have no problem rebelling against God.</p><p>Right? And they said, if you want to live long and prosper in the land, he says, honor your father and mother. In other words, if you want to live, just honor your father and mother. especially in the Western culture, that rebellion against parents is almost accepted. It's one of those, you know, reasonable sins that you should not make it, because every kid does that.</p><p>Right? I'm not saying we need to stone them, but we need to take that sin seriously. Right? Because a child, a rebellious child, should not be something that we just think is acceptable because the world says it's okay. Because the Bible puts a very high standard of that. Right?</p><p>You cannot have a child rebelling against parents be obedient to God. Okay? All right. So next week, we have one more session. So let's go out with a bang. Okay? Chapter 10 and 11. What words or phrases are repeated of the list of descendants? I'm not going to cover, say, who are the descendants?</p><p>Shem, Ham, and Japheth, because that's going to come next week. What are some names that are highlighted in the genealogy? Okay? So pay attention. When it's going quick, which names do you notice and why are they highlighted? Try to identify geographical areas if they mention any of that. Identify any patterns in the genealogy.</p><p>And then what was the stated goal of building the city and the tower in 11.4? And why did this incur God's judgment on them? Okay? And then, again, take some time to review chapter 1 through 11. Even though we have to cover two chapters, I'm going to at least try to review 1 through 11 just to kind of see, make sure that you guys have this memorized.</p><p>So when you come back next week, that's going to be one of the first things I'm going to ask you to do in your small group to try to recite chapters 1 through 11 just generally that at least you know the flow. Okay? And then here are the four discussion questions for today.</p><p>What way are you being fruitful and multiplying? What is a promise that God has made that you cling to for daily life and what promise do you struggle to believe and practice in your walk with God? Okay? Why is honoring a parent so crucial to human survival? I.e. 5th of the 10th generation, 10th commandment and repeated in Ephesians 6.2.</p><p>And there's other places but those are the only two things that I mentioned. And then what covenant are you in and how faithful do you think you are to these covenants? What are the covenants that we're in? We have a covenant with God like unilateral covenant that God has given us.</p><p>Those of you who are married are in a marriage covenant that you made. You are a covenant at Bering Community Church. You're part of this church. Right? Any family that you belong to there is a covenant in there. You don't have to sign a covenant to be in a covenant.</p><p>There's a tie in there. Right? That's universally accepted. So can you name any other covenants that you can think of? Right? You don't have to say I am part of this covenant. There are covenant things that naturally exist right? In life. And so see if you can identify any more but those are the obvious ones and in those covenants are you being faithful to it?</p><p>Okay? And that's the question. Right? let me pray for us and give you time to discuss. Father we thank you for your living word. We pray that as we have this time in our small groups that these discussions Lord God would not simply be to understand and head knowledge but I pray that it would truly search and judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.</p><p>Help us Lord God individually and collectively that we would pursue you with all our hearts Lord and teach us what it means to worship you in spirit and in truth. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
