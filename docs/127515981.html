href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=220s">00:03:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=221s">00:03:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've heard so many times in the back of the car while my parents are driving, sitting</span></div><div

church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=230s">00:03:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd be sitting in there, sitting in the back as a

piling up, seeing the behind the story of people's complaints</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=239s">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and attacks on my dad and my parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=242s">00:04:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember one time, I don't remember my dad raising his voice too often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=249s">00:04:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">My dad was a pretty

saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=259s">00:04:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, somebody said something to my mom, and my dad was on the phone defending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">her to that

negative would be an understatement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=284s">00:04:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So as early as I can

I realize the church was the condition that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/127515981#t=306s">00:05:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it was at, not because
