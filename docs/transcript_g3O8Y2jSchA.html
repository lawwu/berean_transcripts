So if there's people outside, if you see people out just hanging out, you can just go tell them in the cafe. We're going to start right at 11 o'clock. Okay, we're going to get started right at 11 o'clock.</p><p>So if I can have the praise team come and begin to get ready. Come on in and grab a seat somewhere. We're going to get started right at 11. All right, as we prepare to get ready to begin our worship, I just wanted to make clear that you understand the reason why we do this on New Year's Eve.</p><p>And I know that you guys could have, you know, like spend time sleeping or gathering together with your friends and doing the countdown and all that. But the part of the reason why we do this is we want, this is more of a dedication service, that as we face a new year, you know, we had our last Sunday service this morning, but we wanted to give the very first period, again, obviously it's symbolically, but our own hearts, that as we face 2024, and again, as Pastor Mark reminded us this morning, that we would live our lives intentionally, that we would not be just satisfied with, well, you know, we're just sinners and we're all just going to fail, that we would never settle into that, but that we would be resolved to make sure that we live our lives deliberately.</p><p>And so we want to give the first fruits. And I know some of you guys who brought small children to the church, and I know they're tired, but, you know, when our children were young, the reason why we did it is because even though they may not fully understand what they're doing, that they understand, it's like, yeah, I remember we used to go to New Year's Eve services or early rise services, and that they understand how important that our dedicated time is.</p><p>So whether it's New Year's or whether it's Christmas or whether it's whatever services that we have, that in their memory, that it would be embedded in them, that my parents really thought that this was important, that dedicating ourselves to New Year's, that this is more important than our sleep.</p><p>This is more important than anything else that we could do, that making God first in our lives. And even though sometimes we say it in our hearts, we don't necessarily carry it out in the way that we live. And so it's important for us as we face the new year that we want to make sure as we come before God saying like, Lord, whether I succeed or whether I may have a hard time, that at least in my heart, I want to dedicate this new year to be deliberate in making you first.</p><p>And so that's why we're having this service as a community together, that we would dedicate it together. So let me pray for us. And so the way that this night is going to go is that after I pray, our worship is going to lead us in our first song, and then we're going to take about 10 minutes.</p><p>Our media team has created a video to kind of wrap up the year. And then after that, we're going to have our main praise section, and then I'm going to come up and give a short encouragement. And then we're going to split up into if you're here with your families to take time to pray with your families, or if you have people around you to take some time to pray for each other.</p><p>These are some of the things that we're shooting for in the new year. This is how I want to dedicate 2024. And then after that, hopefully we'll be able to finish in time to say Happy New Year together. We're going to have a countdown. And then after that, please go home.</p><p>Okay? And then get some sleep. I know a lot of you guys have a big day tomorrow as well. So let me pray for us, and then we'll begin our worship. Father, we thank you so much for sustaining us through 2023. And as we face a new year, Lord, you know our hearts, our desires.</p><p>Lord, each year as we make resolutions, and oftentimes so frustrated, Lord God, that we are not able to reach our goals. Help us, Lord God, to never give up, though. Knowing, Father, that you are patient, knowing that you called us, knowing, Father God, that we are fighting the good fight.</p><p>Help us not to simply go along with the rest of this world, and not to be given and to be influenced by the tide that is around us. Help us to be resolved to live lives truly worthy of the gospel, not only for ourselves, but even for our children, that they would understand that dedication to you is more important, Lord God, than anything else that we engage in.</p><p>And so we pray that as we spend this time together singing, praising, and praying together, may it be a time, Lord God, that we would truly dedicate our hearts, dedicate our time.

Verse 12, it says, "So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom." Father, we pray for your guidance. We pray for your Holy Spirit to speak to us and that you would remind us, Lord God, of the things that you desire and not just our hearts.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Pastor Mark mentioned this during the service today, but this week has been unique in many ways, but one of the things that I will remember about this year is that we've had more funerals in our church than we've ever had in our church history.</p><p>And I know that while we were going through a pandemic, we said, "Well, this was a crazy few years." During the pandemic, we had to shut down, and even though we were able to open up pretty quickly, I remember a long time ago, I was sharing with another pastor friend of mine who was serving at another church, and his congregation, their average age were in their 70s, and he would tell me how he's constantly attending, having to oversee funerals at his church.</p><p>And I was telling him, at our church, because our church is so young, we would have 10, 20-plus weddings, and so I'm not accustomed to going to a lot of funerals. But this year I would say I probably attended more funerals than I did weddings this year for the first time in ministry.</p><p>And I'm not sure if that's going to be the pattern going forward. I know part of it is because some of you guys are getting older, and you have aging parents, and some of them were very sudden. Some of the people who passed away were, again, young. A lot of them were not just simply of old age.</p><p>Something sudden happened. But as a result of that, it forces us to think about our mortality. In Ecclesiastes 7, 2-4, it says, "It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, because that is the end of every man, and the living takes it to heart.</p><p>But sorrow is better than laughter, for when a face is sad, a heart may be happy. The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, while the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure." If you're in the habit of only surrounding yourselves with pleasure and happiness, and you're not accustomed to being sad or mourning, when you begin to have these feelings of mourning and sadness and something serious, you automatically think something is wrong.</p><p>I've got to go see a psychologist. They're more than willing to just give you pills to make you feel better so you don't think too deeply about these things. The Bible says that it's good for us to mourn. There are times when sadness is good for our souls. In fact, it tells us that it makes us wise to contemplate sadness, to attend funerals.</p><p>It causes us to think because this is the destiny of every man. Because of where we live, we have a tendency to kind of like funerals and death, and we kind of put it up in the-- We know it's real. We know it happens. But as soon as it's over, we want to go right back to our joy, to our parties, to our weddings.</p><p>But this is the destiny of every man. And the more we contemplate it, it says it makes us wise. In fact, Psalm 90.12 says, "Teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom." When you mourn, and I know many of you in this room have faced sadness this year.</p><p>Maybe it was heart-wrenching. Maybe it was difficult. But mourning causes us-- It says it gives us a heart of wisdom. Psalm 90 is a psalm that Moses wrote. And no one has seen more death in his leadership than probably Moses. Because when Moses entered into that desert, he entered with 600,000 fighting men, but if you include the women and children, it was well over a million people.</p><p>And the Scripture tells us that whole generation got wiped out. And by the time they went into the new promised land, it was a completely new generation with new leadership that went into the promised land, which means that he oversaw the death of over a million people during those 40 years.</p><p>And so Moses is not just saying something just off the cuff. This is something that he's experienced over and over again, hundreds of thousands of deaths that he oversaw. And he's concluding in that, "Teach us, Lord, not only that they died," and he doesn't say, "So that we don't die." He says, "We know where they went, we're all going.</p><p>"Help us not to simply be afraid "that what happened to them won't happen to us." But in fact, he says, "Help us to meditate on that. "Help us to number our days, "to recognize that where they went is where we're going, "so that we may live wisely." This morning, this afternoon, I wanted to talk about, like, what gives us wisdom?</p><p>What is it about the meditation of death, or knowing the shortness of our life, that causes us to have heart of wisdom, right? Death, number one, reminds us how fragile our life is, right? When all you do is fill your life with laughter, you think that this is going to be forever.</p><p>You think that that's the normal, that's what's normal. He says, Psalm 95 through 6, "You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep." He gives three examples of how fleeting life is. Like a flood that comes, and all of a sudden, it's gone. It's like you just, all of a sudden, fall asleep.</p><p>And then he says, "In the morning, they are like grass, "which sprouts anew. "In the morning, it flourishes and sprouts anew. "Toward evening, it fades and withers away." Just like the morning dew comes, and then next thing you know, it's completely gone. He says that's what our life is like.</p><p>It's like a flood, it's like our sleep, it's like a dew. Help us to know that this is how fleeting our life is, how fragile it is. Psalm 39, 4 through 5, "Lord, make me know my end, "and what is the extent of my days. "Let me know how transient I am.</p><p>"Behold, you have made my days as high-end breath, "and my lifetime as nothing in your sight. "Surely, every man at his best is a mere breath." One of the advantages of getting older is that you have lived more, you know, much more than you know that's ahead of you, right?</p><p>So if you're in your 20s, right, you think you have a whole life ahead of you. You're going to find somebody, you're going to get married, you're going to have children, so you have a long life ahead of you. So you think. You ask anybody who's lived, you know, in their 50s or 60s, and I've mentioned this so many times.</p><p>My 25th birthday seems like yesterday, and I'm not--I know everybody, you know, gets older, says the same thing, but it really went by that fast. I remember the 40s went by so fast, right? I can't believe I just turned 40, and then now I'm 50. So in the 50s, I stopped even counting, right?</p><p>It goes by so fast. Next thing you know, you're in your 60s, and then you see your parents pass away. And mortality is real. No matter how hard we work to try to hold on to life just a little bit longer, you can go to the gym and stay as healthy as you can, and you can extend your life another 5, maybe 10-plus years, but at the end of the day, no matter how healthy you are, it says possibly 70, possibly 80.</p><p>It says Psalm 90.10. That's where the days of our life contain 70 years, or if due to strength, 80 years. Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for soon it is gone and we fly away. Why is it important for us to understand and to meditate on how fleeting this life is?</p><p>Because the decisions that we make oftentimes are very short-sighted, right? Things that we value. I don't know about you, but when I was younger, we used to play marbles, and either we play marbles or we used to play, like in Korean it's horchak, you know, like even and odd, right?</p><p>And then we would play, and then the kids who are good would be able to accumulate, and there was this one kid in our neighborhood who had a full box of marbles, and he was the most popular kid in our neighborhood because he was really good at marbles. You know what I mean?</p><p>And so some of us who had a little, you know, we would always envy, and we would almost want to play him, but we could never beat him because he had so much. And I remember thinking back to that now, they're all marbles, you know? And I remember one day I was able to play, and I had a winning streak, and then he got mad, and he bet the whole thing, and I won the whole thing.</p><p>That was my most favorite childhood memory. And I remember that was the envy of all the kids in the neighborhood, but if you look at it now, how silly that was. But at that time, accumulating those marbles seemed so important, and the kids who had the most marbles were the most popular kids, and we tried so hard to be good at playing these marbles so we can accumulate more of it, but now as an adult looking back at it, it was worthless glass that we were fighting for.</p><p>When we don't have a concept of where we're headed, and we don't realize how fleeting this life is, so many things that are so fleeting and is meaningless become so important that we fight, we envy, we covet, we sacrifice, we compromise, we sin in order to get that. But in light of eternity, you're going to look back at it and say they were just a bunch of marbles.</p><p>They were meaningless. So that's why he says contemplate, teach me to number our days so that I may have a heart of wisdom, that I may be able to see what is truly valuable and what is worthless. The whole Bible, number two, was written in the context of eternity.</p><p>You can't properly understand and apply the scriptures unless you understand what he just says. If our mind is not set on where we're headed and we're so concerned that we get to the next stage and you're not thinking about eternity, scripture is not going to make a lot of sense to you, nor is it going to be relevant to you.</p><p>The biggest problem with the health and wealth gospel is that they said if you sacrifice now, if you give your money now, God will multiply 30 times 60 a hundredfold, and it's not necessarily wrong. The scripture tells us to sacrifice and that we will have great rewards in heaven.</p><p>But the problem is they think the reward's going to happen tomorrow. They think the payoff's going to happen during this short period of time. So even though we easily point fingers and say, "Oh, the health and wealth gospel people, "they're teaching the false doctrine," but how many of us work hard and sacrifice, thinking that if I put in my time when I'm 19 that the payoff's going to happen when I'm 22?</p><p>If I sacrifice and put away a little bit, I'm going to work hard and sacrifice so that I can have a better retirement. How much of our focus and sacrifice and work is dedicated so that you can sacrifice here so that you can have a better life here? But when you look at it in the context of eternity, it means nothing.</p><p>It's just a very short period of time. We contemplate, right? So many theologians and denominations argue over when is Jesus going to come. Is it before rapture? Is it going to be post-rapture? Is it amillennial? Is it postmillennial? And all these things are good things to contemplate because they are in Scripture, but so much of our energy is fixated on the timing of the coming of Christ, trying to figure out when these things are going to happen, and not enough time is focused on the fact that we are going to go no matter what.</p><p>Not simply on the time of when He's coming, but on the time of when we're going. Majority of us are going to go to Him before He comes. Majority of us are going to go to Him. And so there's all this argument about when He's going to come is interesting.</p><p>And there's nothing wrong with it. It's in the Scripture. We should be studying it. But how much time do we dedicate to really understanding that we're going to go to Him? 100%. When am I going to go to Him? When was the last time you thought about your death?</p><p>When was the last time you thought about your death? You know, it's interesting, if you go online, and you're like, "How long will I live?" There's so many websites that will tell you. And they'll ask you your age, and then they'll tell you how much you got left. They'll ask you your height.</p><p>They'll ask you your weight. They'll ask you your health concerns. They'll ask you about, you know, your family history of illnesses or cancer. And then you have about 20 questions that you ask, and then they calculate, and they'll tell you that based upon the answers that you gave, that you have this much to live.</p><p>Right? Well, I did it. I punched the numbers, and it said the probability that I will live up to 73 is high, it says. And so if I live long, maybe 83. Right? That's what it says. That it will be somewhere between 73 to 83. My father lived to 75, so in my mind, I'm thinking 75, which is about 20 more years from now.</p><p>20 more years isn't that long of a period. If I had 20 more years, how would I want to live those 20 more years? How do I want my 2024 to look like if I had 20 more years? What will I do? How will I spend my time? How will it change my values?</p><p>Maybe some of you may think that you have longer time, right, because you're younger. Some of you guys are older. Whatever it is, whether you have 60 more years, or whether you have 20 more years, or whether you have 10 more years, at the end of it, you're all going to say the same thing.</p><p>Wow, that went fast. That went fast. You have small children now. Next thing you know, you turn around. They're driving the car, and they're leaving the house. Wow, that went fast. Nobody at the end of their life say, "Wow, that took long. That didn't go as fast as I wanted." Nobody.</p><p>I've never heard anybody say that. Every single person, as the time passes, you look back at it and say, "Wow, that went fast." In Colossians 3, 2-4, it says, "Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</p><p>When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory." I'm going to read one more quote before I want to show you a video. From "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis, it says, "If you read history, you will find that Christians who thought most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next.</p><p>It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at heaven, and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth, and you will get neither." How many of us are aiming for heaven? How many of us are aiming for earth?</p><p>Even the way you're raising your children. How many of you are raising your children to aim for heaven, not earth? Not so that they can be successful, not so that they can be great, not so that they can be honored while they're here. How much of our focus in raising our children is so that they would treasure heaven?</p><p>When was the last time you talked about death with your children? One day, I'm not going to be here. One day, you're not going to be here. One day, Grandma's not going to be here. One day, we're going to be buried. When you get buried, how would you want to be buried?</p><p>Do you want to be buried? Do you want to be cremated? It seems morbid to think about it. I don't want to scare-- I don't want to make my children sad. But the Scripture says it's good to be in the house of mourning because it gives us a heart of wisdom to think about the end because that is exactly where we're all headed.</p><p>And for Christians, it is not morbid. That's where our hope lies. The whole reason why we are believers in Christ is not so that we can have a better life here. It's so that we can have a better eternity. And yet, we know that that's true, and yet we think and meditate so little.</p><p>We prepare so little for eternity. We think about eternity. We sing about eternity. We study about eternity, right? And yet, so little is planned for where we're all headed, right? Third and final thing, when we think about our death, it helps us to enjoy what we have now. It's not just like we're going to go home.</p><p>We're going to be so sad. Knowing that our time is short helps us to enjoy what we have here, right? When you're raising young children, you're so eager to get them to the next stage, and you don't really enjoy the kid during that period. But if you knew for a fact how quickly that period passes, you would appreciate what you have much more.</p><p>The stage that you have is a short period of time. You're going to wake up one day, and they're gone. So knowing the end is going to come quickly, it helps us to appreciate everything that we have. Not only does it help us to appreciate what we have, second, it helps us to endure through hardship, because even that will pass.</p><p>No matter how difficult of a situation that you're in, no matter how hard the trial may seem, knowing that we are headed toward eternity helps us to see that this is all temporary. So the temporary things that are good, it helps us to enjoy it more, and the temporary hardships that come into our life, it helps us to endure it better.</p><p>And so as we look to the new year in 2024, I want us to contemplate together, how would we spend 2024 if you knew that this was it? If you knew that this was it, how would you treat your wife, your husband, your children, the friends, the church, your walk with God?</p><p>What things would you change if 2024 was your last year? Because one of these days, it will be. 100%. One of these days, I'm going to say what I'm saying now, and it will be reality, that that will be my last sermon, that that will be my last encouragement, and it will be your last worship that you give.</p><p>So in 2024, what will we change? So I want to watch this video. It's a short three-minute video, and then I'm going to break us up into groups and take some time to pray with each other before we say Happy New Year. If you can turn that video on.</p><p>No, not yet. This is your life. It looks pretty full, doesn't it? That's because it is. It's full of all the things you'd be incomplete without. Love, family, food, water, health, your parents, your passions. With all of these things, you could have nothing else and still lead a full life.</p><p>But even with all of this, you'll still have some space to fit more things, smaller things. This is your job, your car, your house, money. Things that are still important. But if you took them all away, your life would still be full. If you're watching this video, that means you're lucky enough to have at least some of these things.</p><p>But if you're really lucky, and many of us are, you'll still have some space left over. These are the really small things. Watching a movie, playing a video game, sports, ice cream. Things that make your life that little bit nicer, but things that are really just trivial in the end.</p><p>If you wanted, you could try to put these things first. Wasting your time in front of the television, or the computer, playing games, or whatever it might be. You could follow it up with the material things. Money, cars, houses, clothes. But then when it comes time to try to fit in all the important things, you run out of space.</p><p>Some things will have to be left out. And nobody wants that. So keep that in mind as you go through life. Put the really important things first, and then find space for the rest. If you run out, it really won't matter anyways. It's just the small stuff. And then that we live our life purposefully.</p><p>So why don't we do this? If you're here with your families, if you can break up with your families, take some time to pray. If you don't finish, we'll give you time to finish after the countdown. So you don't necessarily have to rush. But if you can break up, or if you're here with other friends, just kind of get in a little circle of maybe about four or five people.</p><p>And then we're going to have to do this quick or else while we're separating, we're going to say "Happy New Year." Okay? So if you're here with your family, just grab your family and then get in a small circle. And then a few minutes before the countdown, we'll come up, do the countdown, say "Happy New Year," and then we'll let you take a few minutes of your prayer time.</p><p>Okay? For those who are able, why don't we all stand together as we sing our closing praise for... You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Where the spirit leads, as I'm followed.</p><p>I depend on you. I depend on you. For the victory's still in front of me. I depend on you. I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide.</p><p>Be my strength, my song and my life. Be my all, my treasure, my prize. I am yours forever, you're mine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. When I pass, when I pass through death, as I enter rest. I depend on you. I depend on you. For eternal life to be raised with mine.</p><p>I depend on you. I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the life. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm the branch and you are the vine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Be my strength, my song and my life. Be my all, my treasure, my prize.</p><p>I am yours forever, you're mine. Draw me close and teach me to abide. Should nothing of our efforts stand, no legacy survive. Unless the Lord does raise the house in vain. It's builder's strife. To you who boasts tomorrow's gain. Tell me, what is your life? A mist that vanishes at dawn.</p><p>All glory be to Christ, our King. All glory be to Christ, our King. All glory be to Christ. His rule and reign will ever sing. All glory be to Christ, our King. All glory be to Christ. His rule and reign will ever sing. All glory be to Christ. Let's pray.</p><p>Father, we thank you so much for our brothers and sisters, Lord, in this church where we can run this race together. Lord, in times of celebration, Lord, that we would be able to come together and rejoice together. But also in times of mourning, Lord God, and in hardship. That our brothers and sisters around us would be the people that we lean on, that we would gain strength in.</p><p>That we are sharpened by, and at times even rebuked, Lord God. I pray that you would knit our hearts together as one. That you would truly give us a heart of wisdom. That in 2024, whatever it is that you have ordained, that we would greet it, Lord God, with confidence.</p><p>That you would be at the center. Lord, as we go our own way, help us, Lord God, to make you our first. That you would not simply be Lord, Lord, on our lips. But our whole year, Lord God, that we would pursue you with all our might. May Christ, in Christ alone, be magnified in our lives.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Alright, so if we can take a few minutes just to say, greet one another, say hello, happy new year. And then, if we can make our way out of the sanctuary. And then we'll see you next Sunday at 8 a.m. Okay? Alright.</p></div></body></html>
