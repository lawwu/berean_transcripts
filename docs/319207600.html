And, you know, I've had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=11s">00:00:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations with people in this Bible study, and I know for some of you who've never done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=15s">00:00:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">inductive Bible study, this is a lot. Alright, those of you who've never, you know, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=21s">00:00:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't been in the habit of reading the Bible, and all of a sudden you jump in asking questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=26s">00:00:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and cross-referencing, and it's a lot. But, it's kind of like exercising, right? If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=35s">00:00:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't exercised for a long time, your muscle hurts, and it's tiring, but in the long run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=40s">00:00:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's good for you, right? And so, getting in the habit of studying the Bible is not just important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=47s">00:00:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it is essential. It is essential to your walk with God, because if you don't learn how to eat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=53s">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual food, you will always be dependent upon somebody else to feed you. So, if you happen to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=60s">00:01:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">be around other people who are encouraging you, strengthening you, then you're doing okay. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=66s">00:01:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">as soon as those people disappoint you, or something goes wrong, you're in the pits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=70s">00:01:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so, you can't live your Christian life always hitched to somebody else feeding you. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=76s">00:01:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so, this is absolutely, this is not just important, it is essential for your walk with God, right? And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=82s">00:01:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, Apostle Paul even mentions that about not being persuaded with persuasiveness of speech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=89s">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's constantly coming in where there's a deliberate attack for you to stray in your mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=95s">00:01:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and your thinking, and your life. So, if that's where you are, you're not walking with God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=99s">00:01:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably don't even notice that that's happening. But, if you're even somewhat interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=104s">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in trying to pursue God, you'll probably have already noticed that there is a constant pressure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=109s">00:01:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and attack, or even subtle, that's coming in to cause you to stray, right? And so, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=114s">00:01:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't emphasize enough why this is so important, okay? And, I've also had some conversation with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=122s">00:02:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys where, you know, you've read the Bible, and maybe you've even memorized, but you've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=127s">00:02:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">studied the Bible in this way before. And, I'm hoping that some of you will share the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=133s">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sentiment. It is a world of difference between hearing a sermon and giving you insights that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=139s">00:02:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've received, and just kind of spoon-feeding you, and coming back saying, "Oh, I'm really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=144s">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">encouraged by that," than you searching and finding treasures for yourselves, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=150s">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">how many of you find that? It's just a completely different insight, completely different impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=157s">00:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Just raise your hand. Show other people. Okay? World of difference, right? So, if you're able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=164s">00:02:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to—I remember, I shared this before, but I remember the first time just in the library,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=168s">00:02:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just starting through Thessalonians, and the insight that I was able to gain on my own. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=173s">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all of a sudden, it really felt like I had three eyes, and one of my eyes got open. I wasn't using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=178s">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it for all that time, and all of a sudden, it just—I had a completely different perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=182s">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of the world, that I was able to come to the Word of God. And, it's different hearing from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=187s">00:03:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody, "God said this," versus hearing from God directly, right? Because that's what it feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=193s">00:03:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like when you gain insight from the Word of God, and God begins to speak to you directly from God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=197s">00:03:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Word. Okay? So, even though it's tedious, and it may be difficult, and you do have to do some work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=204s">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to gain things out of it, it is a world of difference in your walk with God to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=209s">00:03:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">come to the Word and find insights on your own. Okay? So, let me pray for us, and we'll jump right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=213s">00:03:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in.

In Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right. So, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=258s">00:04:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, if you look at the questions that I gave you, and again this is just kind of help you, guide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=263s">00:04:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you through some of the things that that I'll be going over, but the first thing every week, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=268s">00:04:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of give you some guidance, it says look for repeated words, similar words, and ideas in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=273s">00:04:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the immediate area to get an idea of the thought flow of the writer. Okay? So, as you are studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=278s">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this, before you ask questions, as you are reading this, that's probably the first thing that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=284s">00:04:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">should be doing. Right? What are words that are repeated here? What are phrases that are repeated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=290s">00:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What are, look for words that connect ideas or conclude ideas from one thought to another. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=297s">00:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You should be circling these, highlighting these, connecting these, because it'll help you get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=303s">00:05:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thought flow of the writer. You understand what I'm saying? And that's why I divided the verses in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=310s">00:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the way that I did. Right? Instead of just giving you verse by verse 1, verse 2, verse 3, verse 4, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=315s">00:05:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">try to break it down into the thought flow, so you can clearly see that this is his main point, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=321s">00:05:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is his sub point, and then therefore he transitions into this, and this sentence leads to these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=327s">00:05:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thoughts. So that while you are reading it, you clearly see the outline of what he's saying. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=332s">00:05:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the point, what's a sub point, and what is his supporting argument? Right? So, these are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=339s">00:05:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that I told you that every time if I do Bible study, prepare for sermons, I do this first, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=344s">00:05:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then I go back and look for repeated words or phrases or transitional phrases, and then once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=350s">00:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I start circling these things, it's pretty clear what he's trying to get at. Right? And then once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=356s">00:05:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I get the outline of his thoughts, then I can go back and start asking questions. What did he mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=361s">00:06:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by that? Why did he say this? And clearly he's saying this, and it concludes over here, but if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=366s">00:06:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you, before you get all of that, and you jump in, and why did he mean this, you're asking a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=371s">00:06:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outside the context that you don't understand yet. You understand? Okay? So you have to understand the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=379s">00:06:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">context before you jump in to the text. That's why we do a broad study, chapter study, and then, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=387s">00:06:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">then you have smaller divisions like one through eight, but even within the smaller divisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=392s">00:06:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there are paragraphs, and there's ideas. So you want to break that down before you start to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=397s">00:06:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">into, because it'll help you gain observations. Okay? So what are some words that are repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=404s">00:06:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here? Just yell it out if you, if you notice, and it doesn't have to be the exact same words. Similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=413s">00:06:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">words. Okay? Christ, definitely. Can you point it out to us? It doesn't just have to be you. Obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=426s">00:07:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ is repeated. Tell us where you see it. Okay? Verse two. Where is that? Here? Keep yelling it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=442s">00:07:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Five, six, and then eight. Okay? Hm? Okay. Good. Him. Keep going. Six says him. Where else? I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=467s">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I did it. Okay. What are you looking at? Okay. Christ himself. In whom? Okay. Good. Anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=494s">00:08:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">else? In? Okay. So in transition. Okay. Oh, is that what you mean? Okay. Okay. Alright. Very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=513s">00:08:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So clearly, right, just, just looking at the highlights alone, you can say, I mean, this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=520s">00:08:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is like, what about Christ is something else. But obviously he's talking about Christ, right? I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=526s">00:08:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, the whole Bible is talking about Christ, but it's concentrated here. Okay. What, what else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=531s">00:08:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Knowledge. Okay. Can you yell out where it is? No. Okay. Wait. Is there something else? I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=544s">00:09:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">only have one highlight. All right. No, there's no yellow. There's no purple. What? Wait, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=561s">00:09:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that? Oh. Yeah, you guys treat me like grandpa. Okay. Okay. Where else? Okay. Where's that? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=587s">00:09:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Okay. Anywhere else? Okay. Good. Understanding. Okay. So you can see that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=609s">00:10:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's kind of concentrated here in the beginning. Okay. So all of these things will help us. Is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=614s">00:10:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there anything else? Oh. Okay. Okay. That's, that's good insight where Paul says repeatedly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=628s">00:10:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"I." Right? So what does that tell us when you see repeatedly he's saying, "I"? Something about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=637s">00:10:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">his ministry, about his, his goal, his desire. Okay. Good. What else? Okay. Treasures of wealth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=647s">00:10:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Can you tell me where they are? Okay. Did I miss something? Is that it? Or did I miss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=666s">00:11:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something? Can you see? Okay. Anything else? Okay. All right. Good. I was waiting for that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=683s">00:11:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">come out. All right. So. Okay. Very good. In fact, we'll see the word good discipline also fits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=702s">00:11:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">into that. Right? Even built up. So all of these are similar ideas of being stable. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=708s">00:11:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Being rooted. Okay. Okay. The opposite of that deception, delusion, being captive. Right? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=721s">00:12:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So just from the repeated words, you can already see the thought flow. Right? And so where is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=726s">00:12:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">division? Versus two, like one, two, and three. Right? How would you title this? Maybe Paul's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=745s">00:12:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">goal in ministry. And then five and six, instructions for the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=772s">00:12:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So broadly speaking, that's how it's kind of broken down. Right? All right. So let's go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=781s">00:13:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">back and look at verse one. He starts by saying, for I want you to know. And again, these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=790s">00:13:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things that, like I said, if possible, do not look at commentaries. Right? Even if there might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=798s">00:13:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">great insight in the commentary, our goal in this Bible study is not for you to learn how to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=803s">00:13:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">commentaries. Because if you are in the habit of going to comment to every question you have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=808s">00:13:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">before digging, before doing the homework, you're going to just jump and say, oh, I wonder what my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=813s">00:13:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">study Bible says. Or I wonder what he says. And then whatever he says becomes your theology. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=817s">00:13:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then if you were asked to defend it, you can't defend it. Right? I've talked to so many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=824s">00:13:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">who say, I'm a cessationist, I'm a Calvinist. It's like, why? And then they'll quote somebody. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=830s">00:13:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I didn't ask you, like, they're not the final authority. Like, I didn't ask you what John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=834s">00:13:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">McCarthy thinks. I didn't ask you what some study Bible says. Like, how did you come to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=839s">00:13:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conclusion? So a lot of people can't defend the doctrines that they're so strong on. How can you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=845s">00:14:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be so strong on a doctrine that you can't defend? Other than dropping names or some books that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=851s">00:14:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">read. Right? You have to be able to defend it. So if you don't get in the habit of studying the Word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=856s">00:14:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, your doctrines will always be dependent upon who influenced you the most. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=862s">00:14:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in college and you happen to be a part of a Bible study that has certain doctrines, everything they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=867s">00:14:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">believe, you're regurgitated. They're not your convictions. They're convictions of people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=872s">00:14:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you respected. Right? Until they become your convictions, you're not going to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=876s">00:14:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">defend it. So when somebody else comes along that you respect, that starts to contradict the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=881s">00:14:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">doctrines that you profess, you're going to get confused. You don't know what to believe. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=886s">00:14:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you become open to all kinds of attack. Right? And so again, you have to get in the habit of looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=892s">00:14:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at the scripture and finding where you found your convictions. And you can't do that unless you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=897s">00:14:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Word of God yourself. So the word for "no" here, again, this is not something that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=902s">00:15:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know unless you know the background. This is one of those things that are very, very key in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=907s">00:15:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interpretation. Because there are different words for "no." Right? And I've mentioned it so many times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=913s">00:15:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in sermons and Bible study. There is a two basic understandings, "Oida" and what's the other word?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=918s">00:15:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Gnosko." Right? "Oida" is just learning from perception, studying. Right? The word here is "Oida."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=927s">00:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When he says here, "knowledge of God," guess what that is? "Gnosko." Right? So his goal in for you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=938s">00:15:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oida" is what? So that you may have "Gnosko." Okay? So just by knowing the two different words, even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=948s">00:15:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">though in English is the same word, you know that everything he's saying here, like I want you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=954s">00:15:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">perceive and understand how much I labor for you, how much I suffered so that you may be united in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=959s">00:15:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">mind. And he says all of this for what purpose? Where does he take us to? So that you may have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=964s">00:16:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">true knowledge of God's mystery, that you may personally know. Right? So he's not, again, as we said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=972s">00:16:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">over and over again, our goal of the study, whether it's Hebrews, Revelation, or Leviticus, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=979s">00:16:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Colossians, is not simply so you can say, "I, Oida." Right? That I know what it says. I can tell you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=987s">00:16:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">give you the answer. The goal of every "Oida" in Bible study is to get you to "Gnosko."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=993s">00:16:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Have a personal knowledge of God. Right? So again, this is not something that you would know just in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=998s">00:16:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">English, but again, as you continue to do interpretation, that's one of the first questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1002s">00:16:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that you will ask. Is this "Oida" or is this "Gnosko?" Because that will make a big difference in how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1007s">00:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understand this text. Okay? So he starts by saying, "How great a struggle I have for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1012s">00:16:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">behalf of you and Laodicea." Only one question came in today, and that is, "Why does he mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1019s">00:16:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Laodicea with Colossians?" It's because Colossae is right under Laodicea. Colossae could have easily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1027s">00:17:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">been one of the seven letters of the Asia Minor churches in Book of Revelation, because it literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1034s">00:17:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is right underneath. The very next city is Colossae. If you remember, remember Asia Minor, that whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1041s">00:17:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">area, Church of Smyrna, Philadelphia, Laodicea, like all those churches right there, they're all in Asia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1047s">00:17:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Minor. If you remember, Asia Minor was a place where the Holy Spirit tells Paul not to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1052s">00:17:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he has a vision, and he ends up going into Macedonia because of a vision to come over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1060s">00:17:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">During that period, there was heavy persecution that was going on in Asia Minor. Right? So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1065s">00:17:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">remember, there's very significant things that are happening in this place, because one, persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1070s">00:17:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is happening where the Holy Spirit tells him to avoid it for a period. Right? Later on, Church of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1076s">00:17:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Ephesus is also in that area, where Paul spends the most number of time, or amount of time, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1082s">00:18:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">planting a church. And so Paul had a deep personal connection to this area. The whole Book of Galatians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1089s">00:18:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right, is also written. And then he writes Galatians because there was a very urgent matter of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1095s">00:18:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Judaizers having a deep impact. So the false teachers were having a huge impact in this area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1100s">00:18:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at a lot of Paul's attention, much of it goes to that area. And even the seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1106s">00:18:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">churches are located right in that area. You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So those churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1112s">00:18:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in Asia Minor, there's a concentration of activity that's taking place right in that area. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1117s">00:18:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul is writing this church to Colossae, but his concern is not just Colossae, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1123s">00:18:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the influence is way, way beyond Colossae. The other churches are being affected by what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1128s">00:18:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">concerned about here. Okay? One of the first questions I asked in this is, "How great a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1133s">00:18:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">struggle I have for..." Why was it important that the Colossians and the others knew that Paul was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1139s">00:18:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling from that? This is just a, you know, just a thought that I had. Like, why do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1147s">00:19:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul starts out by saying, "I want you to know how much I'm struggling for you." Is it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1151s">00:19:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because he's trying to introduce themselves? It's like, "Yay, you know, like this is what I'm doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1156s">00:19:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. You better appreciate me when I get there." Right? "Get some good food ready, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1161s">00:19:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't know how much I struggle for you." Why is it important that they understand how much he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1168s">00:19:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling for them? Okay, to encourage them that they're important. Right? Again, you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1180s">00:19:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">understand that Apostle Paul wasn't an ordinary missionary. He was the apostle appointed for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1187s">00:19:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentiles. Right? So when the Apostle Paul is writing this letter, he's not just your uncle or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1194s">00:19:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some guy that they respect. This is the appointed apostle to them. Right? So for him to say, "You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1201s">00:20:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know how much I'm struggling for you." I mean, that's like almost saying, "God is bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1205s">00:20:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you to my attention. You're important to God." Right? In Apostle Paul, specific revelation is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1212s">00:20:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">coming through Apostle Paul, where he's getting the mystery that was hidden for a period, and he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1217s">00:20:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">revealing it to them. So the fact that Paul is struggling to get to them, again, it's a reminder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1222s">00:20:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to them. He's not talking about how much I love you. Right? Of course, that is written in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1229s">00:20:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's a reminder to them so that they may be what? Encouraged. Right? The Apostle Paul knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1237s">00:20:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Right? And he's praying for you, and he's struggling and risking his life to get this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1242s">00:20:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">message to you. So be encouraged. God has not forgotten you. He's not simply speaking on his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1248s">00:20:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">behalf. He's speaking on behalf of Christ. Right? When he says, "I'm personally see me in front of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1256s">00:20:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that their hearts may be encouraged." What do you think was the source of their encouragement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1261s">00:21:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where we get into trouble, because we want to encourage people. Like Apostle Paul says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1269s">00:21:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">his goal is to encourage them. So we want to encourage you. Right? So if encouragement is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1275s">00:21:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the goal, how do I encourage you? God loves you just the way you are. There's nothing you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1283s">00:21:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for God to love you any more than the way he loves you now. There's nothing you can do where God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1289s">00:21:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be disappointed in you. You're salvaged, you're secure. Right? Now, none of this is wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1294s">00:21:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but we have to understand when he says, "I'm coming, I'm suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1299s">00:21:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so that you may be encouraged." What was the content of his encouragement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1304s">00:21:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Well, he spells it out. Right? That you may have the attaining to the all the wealth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1313s">00:21:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes from the full assurance of understanding. In other words, all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1317s">00:21:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not just talking about the things that you like. He's talking about your encouragement comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1323s">00:22:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from the whole truth. Right? And nothing but the truth. So the encouragement isn't just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1331s">00:22:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life," but the whole encouragement is the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1335s">00:22:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. All of it. That you may come to a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is Christ himself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1341s">00:22:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in whom are hidden the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Right? So we have to be careful that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1347s">00:22:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't make encouragement our goal. Encouragement is the byproduct of truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1351s">00:22:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? Encouragement is not the end goal. It's just something that we get when we pursue the truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1359s">00:22:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And if you also notice, he said, "The encouraged having been knit together in love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1367s">00:22:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and attaining to all the wealth that comes from him, the full assurance of understanding." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1372s">00:22:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these things are things that we pursue together. So truth and practice of love and being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1379s">00:22:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">encouraged, they're all tied together. Right? You don't have pursuit of truth and unity as two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1386s">00:23:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">separate things. You can't have one without the other. You can't have a heart that's filled with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1392s">00:23:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">bitterness and disunited and says, "But when it comes to truth, I'm right." Because your ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1397s">00:23:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand the truth is directly linked to the condition of your heart. Right? Even justification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1407s">00:23:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "They suppress the truth because they prefer the darkness rather than the light."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1413s">00:23:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they reject the truth. Do you think that doesn't happen as Christians?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1417s">00:23:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you reject the truth in one arena of your life, do you think that doesn't affect your ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1424s">00:23:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand the heart of God? What is intended? Yeah, of course it does. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1429s">00:23:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why when the scripture says, "Before you bring a gift to the altar, if you know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1434s">00:23:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody has something against you, go and deal with that first." Right? "Forgive my debts as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1439s">00:23:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have forgiven my debtors." Right? And so that's why every time we have communion, he says to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1446s">00:24:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">examine. "He who eats and drinks without acknowledging the body of Christ eats and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1451s">00:24:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">drinks judgment upon himself." So every time we have communion, it forces us to examine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1455s">00:24:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Is my relationship with God separate from my relationship with one another? They're together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1464s">00:24:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? You can't be right with God if you're wrong with your brothers and sisters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1470s">00:24:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not walking right with God, your ability to discern the truth is affected. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1476s">00:24:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It is. So if you haven't been praying, if you haven't been living a holy life and life with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1483s">00:24:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">integrity, whether it's with your time and with your money, and then you somehow separate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1488s">00:24:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from being able to discern the truth, they go hand in hand. Because we discern the truth by our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1495s">00:24:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mind, we also discern the truth by our spirit. So if your spirit is not right, it also affects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1501s">00:25:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">your ability to understand. So he says, "Encourage, knit together, that we may attain the wealth that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1507s">00:25:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in the knowledge of the mystery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1511s">00:25:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which is Christ himself." Right? Ultimately, it's not simply about the gospel. The gospel is Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1517s">00:25:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Again, I mentioned that the celebration of the gospel is not celebrating the open door,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1524s">00:25:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but what the open door leads to. Right? The gospel isn't access to God. It's God himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1530s">00:25:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Access is just a road. Right? To celebrate that we have access to God and not actually taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1537s">00:25:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the access, you miss the whole point of salvation. The goal is Christ. Okay? He says all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1544s">00:25:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because I say this so that no one will delete you in persuasive arguments. And then he says it again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1548s">00:25:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">later on in verse 8, "See to it that no one takes you captive." And so you could already tell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1553s">00:25:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right, that this is on his mind. There's something urgent going on in Colossae and Laodicea and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1560s">00:26:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Galatians and Ephesus. False teaching has penetrated into the church and he's trying to combat that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1566s">00:26:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And that's the reason why he's telling them to commit to the truth, to commit to one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1572s">00:26:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because as soon as your heart is filled with division, there's a crack where Satan can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1578s">00:26:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">attack even in the way that you think, even the way that you perceive things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1582s">00:26:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">can be perverted by allowing that to permeate in your heart. Right? So we'll get back to verse 4,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1591s">00:26:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1598s">00:26:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">good discipline," and simply some of your translations will say "orderly." Right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1604s">00:26:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's why I said this good discipline, stability, they all are similar words. So Paul's concern here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1610s">00:26:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">verses 5 and 6, is instructions for the church for nothing fancy. It's not taking over the world and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1617s">00:26:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">making sure the gospel goes and risking your life for Christ. Paul's concern for them is to remain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1622s">00:27:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stable because they're being attacked. Right? So there are periods in our life where we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1630s">00:27:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bear arms, basically spiritually, and be ready to run into darkness. But the stage that they're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1637s">00:27:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now is they're being provoked. Right? And just like the book of Hebrews, they're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1643s">00:27:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">starting to drift maybe because of persuasive arguments. Right? So he's saying to be orderly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1650s">00:27:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay stable in your faith. "Therefore, as you have received Christ, so walk in him." Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1658s">00:27:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not enough to just say you receive Christ. Like are you applying it in your life? What is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1663s">00:27:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what does your faith look like in your life outside of Wednesday Bible study and Sunday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1667s">00:27:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">worship? Right? "Walk in him, having been firmly rooted, being built up in him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1674s">00:27:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">establishing your faith." Right? And so much of our Christian faith is about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1686s">00:28:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So much of our Christian faith is learning to be strong. Right? Being rooted in Christ is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1691s">00:28:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something that happens in one time. It's something that happens because of godly habit. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1697s">00:28:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to say something. I know that ever since Pastor Peter Chung came to our church, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1701s">00:28:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this revival of Bible memory. Right? And I knew that was going to happen because he was, he had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1707s">00:28:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">influence. You know, we were like Bible memory was like a thing in our church, mainly because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1712s">00:28:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Peter Chung. Now we always, I always say, you know, I'm amazed by his memory because he's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1718s">00:28:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">he's, he's like, he amazes me. Right? About how much he remembers. And so if he ever says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1725s">00:28:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, in 2014 this happened." Even if I don't remember, it's like, it probably happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1730s">00:28:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because he's good. He's good at that. But as great as his memory is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1738s">00:28:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason why he's so, so good at memorizing, and I don't mean to embarrass him, is because he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1743s">00:29:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">devotes himself to that. He doesn't just read it and as he gets it, it's not like that. He,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1749s">00:29:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">every day, two, three hours a day, he's in front of, he's in front of his, his cards, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1753s">00:29:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">memorizing. So he's utilizing the gift that he has, he's maximizing it. And that's why he's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1760s">00:29:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">good at it. Right? It's not simply because, yes, God has given him a gift of good memory. But he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1765s">00:29:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't, he would, he would remember a lot of random things for no, no good purpose. Like what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1770s">00:29:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of tie I wore 15 years ago. I mean, useless information. Right? But the reason why he's good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1777s">00:29:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at it is because he, he really is devoted. And that's challenging to all of us. Right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1783s">00:29:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so much of our walk with God isn't something like, "Oh, I go to retreats or heard a great sermon, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1789s">00:29:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I joined a good Bible study." So much of our walk with God and our health in our, in our walk with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1794s">00:29:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">God is your daily routines. Or what you do on a day to day basis have far more effect in your walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1802s">00:30:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with God than what retreat you went to and what speaker you heard, what book you read, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1809s">00:30:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what small group or who, who's mentoring you. All of these things are helpful, but nothing will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1816s">00:30:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">impact you as much of a, as much as a daily discipline that you value and you do on a daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1823s">00:30:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">basis. Right? So Paul talking about all of this, all of these things, he says, talking about being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1828s">00:30:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stable, being rooted, being built up, being established. Right? And that's what we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1833s">00:30:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to work on in our Bible studies, right? In our daily routines. See to it that no one takes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1839s">00:30:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">captive. Right? Captive basically means to be carried off. Right? In fact, some of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1847s">00:30:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">translations, it may actually even say, take, take you hostage involuntarily. And he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1854s">00:30:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's because he's using, just like he says in verse four, persuasive arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1860s">00:31:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">With these arguments, if they weren't persuasive, it wouldn't be tempting. No one would be deceived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1865s">00:31:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because it's coming through very articulate men who seem to be representing God, who seem to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1873s">00:31:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">know the scripture, but they're twisting it. Right? So he says, the reason why they're in danger is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1879s">00:31:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because these arguments are persuasive. They're persuasive because they're philosophical. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1885s">00:31:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they have the ability to deceive. It's in accord with tradition of men. In other words, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1891s">00:31:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">around us all the time, according to elementary principles of the world. So the basic principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1897s">00:31:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that surround us and tempt us every single day. So these false teachings are tapping into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1903s">00:31:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is the health and wealth gospel so popular? Because it's tapping into the worldly principle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1909s">00:31:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? That if you work hard, you're going to make money. If you go to get the right job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1916s">00:31:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you connect with the right people, and the health and wealth gospel basically is tapping into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1921s">00:32:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those worldly principles and saying, well, all these things may not work. If you tap into God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1925s">00:32:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get that. Right? So nothing has changed. Only your means to get the world has changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1931s">00:32:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why it's so popular because they haven't abandoned anything. They've never picked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1938s">00:32:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">up their cross. They've never denied themselves. They're still pursuing the world. They're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1942s">00:32:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it in the name of Jesus. And that's why it's popular. And that's why it says it's persuasive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1947s">00:32:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">arguments in accord with traditions of men, in elementary principles of the world. And it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1953s">00:32:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">deceptive because you don't know you're being deceived. Because you're doing it in the name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1960s">00:32:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ. And because you're in the church, because you're reading the Bible, and you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1964s">00:32:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actually praying that you automatically think you're safe. But the only thing that has changed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1970s">00:32:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is the means to get what you want. You're still pursuing your own life. You're still pursuing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1975s">00:32:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">your flesh. You're still pursuing your own glory. It's just you're hoping that God will give it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1979s">00:32:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you instead of you working hard for it. Right? And that's why that theology is so pervasive. And why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1989s">00:33:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it carries us away. That's why you can be in the church all your life. You call me Lord, Lord, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=1994s">00:33:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">say your heart is far from me. Why did they call him Lord, Lord? It wasn't for me. It wasn't because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2000s">00:33:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you were you were wanting me to be your Lord. It's Lord, Lord, give me something. Right? Everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2006s">00:33:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that they did, they did it for themselves. They didn't do it for God. That's what Jesus meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2010s">00:33:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So he said that that's why it's so pervasive. That's why we need to watch out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2016s">00:33:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? But in the end, ultimately, his goal is to get us to Christ. Because what's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2021s">00:33:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">deliver us from these things that are so powerful in our lives? Right? Because all the wealth and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2027s">00:33:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wisdom and understanding is where? In Christ. That's how we keep saying over and over again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2034s">00:33:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to fix your eyes on Christ. Right? Because then you begin to distinguish. Right? When you fix your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2043s">00:34:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">eyes upon Christ, like along with that, the fruit of that, you'll be able to distinguish what is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2048s">00:34:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. But when your eyes are not fixed on Christ, sometimes you're very confused. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2054s">00:34:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes it comes from the pulpit. Sometimes it comes from books and conferences and other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2059s">00:34:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians that you respect. And you don't discern. Because when your eyes are not fixated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2064s">00:34:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on Christ, you're not able to discern the difference. Okay? So in the end, that's his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2070s">00:34:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">main goal. To get us to be fixated on that and not to be carried away. Okay? All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319207600#t=2077s">00:34:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The next week's passage is in Colossians chapter 2, 9 through 15.
