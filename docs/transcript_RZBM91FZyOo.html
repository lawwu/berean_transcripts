And we will now begin with our worship service.                      >> Good morning, welcome to community church. Let me get to our announcements. First, a couple of them. First of all, newcomers lunch is scheduled for December 5th at 1pm. This is for people who are kind of in the process of checking out the church and you have some questions. We have a lot of people who are welcome team members and some of the leaders in the church. So this lunch is provided for that purpose. And so it's happening at 1pm in the sanctuary here. We're going to turn this into a lunch area. And so if you want to sign up for that, if you know somebody that would benefit from that, that's happening again on December 5th at 1pm. And so you can just tell the welcome team and let them know that you're interested and they'll give you more specifics on that. And then the next thing is we have a Christmas gathering sign up. Instead of having a large gathering this year, we're going to be breaking up into homes. So those of you who volunteered, obviously people are going to be scheduled to be at your home. And those of you who haven't signed up, if you're part of the family ministry, we ask you to sign up and then you'll be assigned a certain home probably depending on where you live. And it's scheduled for that day. So our brother Dean Shin is the one who is overseeing this. His email is on the church announcement and I think our app. So if you go there, you'll be able to sign up for that. I think that's it for the announcement. Again, if you are new to our church, our offering basket is in the back, the physical. So if you have a physical offering, there are envelopes there if you want to put it in there. So it says offering basket. It looks like a little birdhouse. So that's where the physical offering is going to go. And for the rest of us, we'll give you a minute to give the electronic offering after. Let's pray. Gracious Father, we thank you so much for who you are. And we thank you, Father, for being patient with us, for enduring with us, for indwelling us, Lord God, with the Holy Spirit. Help us to lift our eyes to know that our hope, our refuge is in you. I pray that our worship that we give you would truly be in spirit and in truth. And even the offering that we give now, help us, Lord God, to give it to you as an act of worship, joyfully, generously, Lord God, in our heart. And may it be multiplied for your use. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.                All right, for those of us sitting inside, would you please stand with us as we continue our worship?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise.                                                          Amen. Let's pray. Psalm 103. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me. Bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His benefits, who pardons all iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion, who satisfies your ears with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle. Lord, help us, Lord God, especially this week, to consider deeply what it is, Lord God, that you have given us, and that our praise, Lord, would manifest, Lord God, in our singing, our giving, our service, and our love. Help us, Lord God, to live this week as a witness to the world, and as the days are turning more and more darker, and there's more and more despair in this world, help us, Lord God, to be people who are thankful, who genuinely worship, that they may see the light in the church and turn to you as well. May Christ be exalted this Thanksgiving season. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.  God sent His Son They called Him Jesus He came to love He lived for good He lived and died To buy my pardon An empty grave is there to fill My Savior lives Because He lives I can face tomorrow Because He lives All fear is gone Because I know He holds the future And life is worth the living Just because He lives Amen.</p></div></body></html>
