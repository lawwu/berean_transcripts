It's really hard to start a friendship cold, just trying to randomly talk to people. And so we felt that starting an English Corner would give us a better opportunity to meet people who know English and we're able to build a friendship that way. It's through these friendships and relationships where the gospel could be shared. And eventually we hope that as time progresses and as more time is invested into the relationship that if they're interested in knowing more about the Bible, knowing more about Jesus Christ, that we would as a team bring them to our Bible study. - Can you describe the format of the English Corner? - So we have our MC start off, which is typically me. We'll just do introductions, explaining what the English Corner is about. And then we follow that with about a 15, 20 minute break, icebreaker. And then we have one of our team members present on a topic. We have different topics all set throughout the year and then we rotate between our members. And then after that, we have discussion questions. - What are the difficulties in building relationships in the city? - Meeting new people is not difficult, but building relationships are, just because when locals meet foreigners, they immediately want to improve their English and that's kind of their own primary goal. So I found it very difficult not making friends, but building a friendship with Chinese locals. - I think definitely finding ways to relate to them because even saying foreigners, sometimes it's easier to get to know them. We already have a lot in common in moving to a different country. But I mean, even with the locals, the ones that are believers, I think it's been difficult to remind myself that as long as you have Christ, that should be enough. - In order for the work to continue and for the church plant to be established, what specific needs do you have? - I think once this current team leaves, we need a lot of help with English Corner. Since English Corner is the main avenue for outreach, we need people to be plugged in to help lead it. I won't be able to just because of the marriage responsibilities I have. So that's why we need people to come and to help out with this specific English Corner. (upbeat music) - Who has the strongest selfie game? - Tony. - Yeah. - What the? - I'll tell you, you're so good at this. (upbeat music)</p></div></body></html>
