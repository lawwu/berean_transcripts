I'd grown up as the youngest in a family of four boys. Our parents had already been attending church and as a result I'd also been brought into church at a young age. I'd be going to church for the games that happened afterwards and for a better group of friends. At the time I didn't know the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian and just assumed I'd been a Christian and had no doubt that I was going to heaven. Just because I may have thought I'd been a good person and my attitude for getting to heaven was to just be a morally good person. I'd be served in the AV team for the youth group there. As time went on, probably around the sixth or seventh grade, these convictions to go to church had found me. I thought I'd found a place where I could have some good friends who were going to be with me forever, but surely it may have failed me. I'd soon grow to hate the church. The church would become a burden on my life and I'd hate going to church. I'd hate going to church every Friday and Sunday and try to leave as soon as possible. Eventually I'd stop going to church. In my school life I would try to be the most popular, try to gain validation from many of those around me and seek after this validation. I'd often do bad things where I'd go to parties, break rules, curse and continue to live a life full of sin. The many fights with my parents infused within our family, I'd turn away from the church and continue to live a life full of sin. At this point I'd not found any meaning in life and I'd been very depressed. I was looking for a joy in the world that could never fulfill me. My brother Justin had asked us many times urging Charles and I to come out to Britain, but we'd always say hurtful things to him and continuously reject him. One thing that I remember him saying to me was, "Hey George, I really think there's something special at the youth group there." Now I can remember him saying, now all I can remember saying to him was, or at least in my head was that he should stop asking me to come every week. I'm never going to come. One week after Justin had asked me again, I still don't know why, but I just had an urge to go and all I could say that it was God's grace and love over me that made me make this decision. Ephesians 2 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith and died not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." God has shown his love and grace to me by bringing me to Brain. After the first week of attending Brain's youth group, I'd seen how welcoming and loving both the students and teachers were and I felt a sense of belonging. Charles and I quickly integrated into the youth group and would continue to attend every Friday and Sunday, Thursday. After listening to many sermons about my sin, it felt like mold rotting inside me. I'd been very convicted and knew I had to change. God then had begun to reveal to me how much of a sinner I was and at that point I began to cut off the many bad influences in my life. By God's grace, I would soon find the desire to study and read his word and to cry out to him in prayer. I am reminded that his word is the only thing that can bring me joy, so I'll continue to strive to obey his word and continue to strive to live a life of holiness. The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart trusts in him and I am helped. Therefore my heart drowns and with my song I shall thank him. Psalms 27. Thank you.  >> So do you understand when you go into the water, you're imagining the heart that's moving, not what you're imagining the river of your life is.</p></div></body></html>
