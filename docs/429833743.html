So what do I mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by that? There are main commandments within this passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=188s">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then there are, I guess you could say, supporting commandments, as you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way you differentiate is by taking a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=196s">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the correct imperatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=200s">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, as I read this, it says, "Be careful how you walk."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=204s">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a standalone imperative. We're not going to stop there. It's a complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=208s">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sentence. He describes that walk by saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Not as unwise, but as wise." But if you take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=216s">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"not as unwise, but as wise" by itself, it almost feels like an incomplete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=220s">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thought. He continues by saying, in John 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 17, the commandment should be, "that you do not walk foolishly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=228s">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but understand what the will of the Lord is." And to summarize, I can say the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">main commandment is, "understand the will." Thirdly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "Do not be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=240s">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This command, "be filled with the Spirit," obviously it's an important one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's a lot more to say about it. But you can clearly figure out one of the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=248s">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">commandments. And then letter D, down in verse 21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the subject of it. So in a simplified way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Walk carefully and walk wisely," I see as the main heading of the paragraph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=260s">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says, "Understand God's will, but then be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"are walked," so being careful and wise, "be filled with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/429833743#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit," almost.
