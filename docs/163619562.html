Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=311s">00:05:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The first fear that we see when he says, "Who am I?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=315s">00:05:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a fear of his own shame and inadequacy. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=320s">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a fear of his, it's a self-doubt. It's a self-doubting fear. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=326s">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he has there essentially saying is, "Okay, I heard you. You've seen the needs of the people and you've heard and you've come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=336s">00:05:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But why do you got to involve me into this? Who am I? I can't go to Pharaoh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=342s">00:05:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't go to the nation, you know, the leaders of Israel. I can't deliver these people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=348s">00:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's a sense to which his questioning is right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=353s">00:05:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because this isn't like fighting the other shepherds. This isn't like fighting another man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=357s">00:05:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going up against the superpower of that time. You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=361s">00:06:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going against the reigning, you know, empire of that generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=365s">00:06:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's thinking that he's going to go to Pharaoh and just be like, "Hey, let all the people go. Okay?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=371s">00:06:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're talking about hundreds and thousands of people, if not a million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=375s">00:06:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this isn't no small task. So rightly, we might think, Moses is saying, "I don't think I'm up for this task."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=385s">00:06:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what's really interesting about this is, I was reading a lot of R.C. Sproul's commentary on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=390s">00:06:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, he writes a lot about the holiness of God. And this is one of the passages that he writes a lot about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=397s">00:06:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was really interesting is he said that he thought Moses was then having an appropriate question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=405s">00:06:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As to, when you see the glory of God, and then the mission of God, you naturally have like a, "Oh, the sense of, I am lowly servant. I can't do this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=418s">00:06:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said, he said this statement that, he made the point that, when you see the glory of God in that light, naturally you're low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=425s">00:07:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what the thing about it is, I absolutely agree with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=428s">00:07:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you have an appropriate view of God, you will naturally see yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=433s">00:07:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And quoting John Calvin, he said this, "A man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=443s">00:07:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And upon that, he comes down after such contemplation to look into himself."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=449s">00:07:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the only way we truly know ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/163619562#t=452s">00:07:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so simply put, knowing yourself begins with knowing God.
