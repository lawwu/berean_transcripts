what the gospel is, and then chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=62s">00:01:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">three he goes into therefore,

but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=94s">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more specifically, not just general prayer, but prayer specifically engaged in what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=101s">00:01:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Evangelism, right?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=105s">00:01:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at all the majority of the writings in the New Testament, there is some</span></div><div

generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=121s">00:02:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, I don't know about you, but the first day I

is real, that the Bible is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=155s">00:02:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">real, then what else would you be thinking of other than who can I tell, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=160s">00:02:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This great

context of evangelism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=170s">00:02:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Churches that he's planted, he's following up on them, and then it ends in exhortation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=174s">00:02:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so therefore now engage in this ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=177s">00:02:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether you are like Apostle Paul going

<span class="t">response to every Christian is to go tell, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=189s">00:03:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why he says we are the light of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=191s">00:03:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't hide a light underneath the table, you put it on the top so all can see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=195s">00:03:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of like how he's summing up the book of Colossians, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/332374209#t=208s">00:03:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we do is to give the outline, right?</span></div><div
