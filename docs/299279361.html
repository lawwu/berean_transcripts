And we want to thank Pastor Peter for having me. And yeah, we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=23s">00:00:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't known him that long, only two, three years, but yeah, there's a definite kinship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=28s">00:00:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I came home on Friday.

We have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=33s">00:00:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so many similarities.

His heart for Christ, his love of the gospel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=55s">00:00:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and his love for you guys.

And so I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=66s">00:01:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know how blessed you are to have him at the helm, leading you towards Christ.

We're going to look at one verse this morning, a verse that may be familiar to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=87s">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of you. And that verse is 27, verse 27 of James chapter one. And before we go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=95s">00:01:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">God's word, will you go with me to the one who gave us the word, let's pray. God, I pray</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=109s">00:01:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that you would fill us with your spirit. Spirit of God, I pray that you would move in power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=121s">00:02:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and grace in a way that goes far beyond me and what I'm capable of. God, we need you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=134s">00:02:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This cannot just be some human activity. God, we are desperate for you, and we want to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=141s">00:02:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your voice. And so God, I pray that you would now, Father, open our eyes. Open our eyes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=151s">00:02:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">God, that we might see the magnitude of your glory. God, open our hearts that we might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=157s">00:02:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feel the weight of your grace. And God, open our mouths that we might declare the wonders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=166s">00:02:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of your gospel. It's in Christ's name we pray, Amen. Now, before we dive into the verse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=176s">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">let me give you the context of the passage so that you understand where James is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=180s">00:03:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">from. In the preceding verses, verses 19 through 25, James talks about the centrality of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=187s">00:03:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">word and how we are to be doers of the word and not just hearers. And the reason for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=194s">00:03:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is because the scriptures were given not simply to inform, but to transform. To transform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our hearts and our minds, our lives, and that change happens, that change occurs when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=204s">00:03:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do what it says. And then in verses 26 and 27, James shows us what a doer of the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=210s">00:03:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like. First, he says a person who has a true grasp on spirituality controls his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=216s">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tongue, that's number one. He controls his tongue. In other words, if you say you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=221s">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">religious, if you say you have faith, but you don't broddle your tongue, an unloving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=227s">00:03:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">gossiping, lying, deceitful tongue, then James says your faith is worthless. It's not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=234s">00:03:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">real thing. And then he says in the very next verse what the real thing looks like. Look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=239s">00:03:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at verse 27 with me. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=248s">00:04:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=257s">00:04:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an astounding statement. James says this is pure religion. This is undefiled Christianity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=268s">00:04:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as far as God is concerned. To visit orphans and widows in their distress. You see, true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=273s">00:04:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">religion is not just hearing truth. It's more than that. It's not just a monotonous routine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=279s">00:04:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of religious activity week after week. No, the heart of true religion is to visit orphans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=284s">00:04:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and widows in their affliction. And that word visit here means so much more than just dropping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=290s">00:04:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by and saying hello every once in a while. This is a word that was used to describe God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=295s">00:04:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It was used of God when God would visit his people. And it means to seek him out with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=300s">00:05:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a deep concern for their well-being and a commitment to care for their needs. And James</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=304s">00:05:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">drives this point home later in chapter 2 when he talks about a true and living faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=309s">00:05:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and how it's expressed in what? In words, right? In good works. More specifically in acts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=314s">00:05:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy toward the poor, the downtrodden, the hurting, the marginalized in our world. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=320s">00:05:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one of James' central points in this letter. Now it's important that we understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=325s">00:05:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that what James says here in verse 27 is not said in a vacuum. He is not arbitrarily singling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out orphans and widows as people we ought to care about. No, what he's doing is he is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=337s">00:05:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">reiterating what God has said all throughout the Old Testament about the people that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=342s">00:05:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cares about. And when you read the Old Testament scriptures, you find that there are three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=347s">00:05:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">groups of people that God singles out time and time and time again as the objects of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=353s">00:05:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">his special mercy. And they are the orphan, the widow, and the sojourner. The orphan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=359s">00:05:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the widow, and the sojourner. For instance, Deuteronomy 10, 18 says, "He executes justice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=364s">00:06:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for the fatherless and the widow and loves a sojourner, giving him food and clothing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=370s">00:06:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Psalm 146, verse 9, "The Lord watches over the sojourners. He upholds the widows and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=374s">00:06:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the fatherless." So God, God describes himself as their defender, their protector, their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=379s">00:06:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">provider, and not surprisingly, he expects his people to do the same. And we see an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=385s">00:06:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of this in Deuteronomy 14, 28, where God says, "At the end of every three years, you shall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=390s">00:06:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bring out all the tithes of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=394s">00:06:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=399s">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=404s">00:06:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hands that you do." So God promises to bless those who bless them. Conversely, God also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=411s">00:06:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">warns of judgment and punishment to those who mistreat them. For instance, in Exodus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=418s">00:06:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">22, verse 21, God says, "You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him. You shall not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=425s">00:07:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mistreat any widow or fatherless child. If you mistreat them and they cry out to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=430s">00:07:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I will surely hear their cry, and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with a sword,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=436s">00:07:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless." Wow, God is not messing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=440s">00:07:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">around here, is he? He is dead serious when it comes to caring about the orphan, the widow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=446s">00:07:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and the sojourner, all of which begs the question, "Why?" Why does he care about them so much?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=452s">00:07:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is he so drawn to the orphan, the widow, and the sojourner? Here's why. Because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=458s">00:07:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">were the most helpless. They were the most vulnerable. They were the most powerless in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=465s">00:07:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that society. To be a sojourner meant that you were incredibly vulnerable, because in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=470s">00:07:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that day, your tribe was everything. And to be away from your people, your tribe, meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=474s">00:07:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that you had nothing. You were incredibly vulnerable. And to be a widow in that day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=479s">00:07:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">guys, was vastly different from what it is to be a widow today. Today, there are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=483s">00:08:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of social programs that care for widows.

There were no orphanages to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=502s">00:08:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">them in.

And it's one thing for a grown-up, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=518s">00:08:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an adult to fend for himself.

He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=542s">00:09:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is decisively drawn to them, and He takes up their cause.

One of the best movies ever made. But the movie's about Nacho,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299279361#t=2279s">00:37:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a friar, who moonlights as a wrestler, right?
