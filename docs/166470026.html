purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=271s">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It was to convey a message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=272s">00:04:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the New Testament or in the scripture, when they say, oh these are the ten foods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=277s">00:04:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that I like the most, you know that whatever they listed the first is probably the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=281s">00:04:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever they listed the last is

Commandments, we know that the very first commandment is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=288s">00:04:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the most significant, most important commandment, which is not to worship any other gods but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=293s">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=294s">00:04:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the other commandments in the Ten

first four commandments is related to our relationship with Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=305s">00:05:05.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=312s">00:05:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we understand, in the first commandment, and then the other three that come underneath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=317s">00:05:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it, obviously, it's obvious that worshiping God and God alone would be the biggest and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/166470026#t=322s">00:05:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the most overarching commandment.</span></div><div
