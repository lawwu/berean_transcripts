href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=17s">00:00:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We started three years ago, March 10th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=20s">00:00:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're actually almost exactly three years it took us to go through Hebrews.</span></div><div class="c"><span

we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=30s">00:00:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">went through the IM statements of Christ.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=36s">00:00:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like one of the benefits of teaching through the Bible is that I benefit from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=42s">00:00:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I remember in the beginning of ministry, you know, when I was a youth pastor and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=48s">00:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was a college and EM pastor, I was just preaching just kind of topically, what does the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=52s">00:00:52.080</a></span> | <span

three, four, five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=56s">00:00:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end of it, I don't, I didn't feel like I knew the Bible any more than I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=61s">00:01:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">after five, six years of it, because it's just, I just knew the topic of discipleship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=65s">00:01:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about prayer, about evangelism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=68s">00:01:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's like 15, 16 different topics and you give different versions of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=72s">00:01:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I remember very specifically, I decided to just preach just verse by verse, starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=77s">00:01:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">from John and then Philippians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=78s">00:01:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I would just make it through the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=81s">00:01:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I remember specifically after finishing Philippians, it's like, oh, I, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=86s">00:01:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I went, I was an undergrad Bible major and I went to seminary, I learned more from studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=91s">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to teach it that way than I did in all the years that I was in seminary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=96s">00:01:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so, you know, the benefit ultimately, I get the first benefit because I'm able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=100s">00:01:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">dig through the scripture and examine it better than before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=103s">00:01:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So Hebrews, I've gone through several times, but I feel like I've probably gleaned more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=107s">00:01:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">than you did from the study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=108s">00:01:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm almost reluctant to leave it, but I do have other passages that I do want to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=113s">00:01:53.200</a></span> | <span

know as we get closer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=118s">00:01:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">After today, we're going to probably take about a month of various different topics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=122s">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that we want to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=123s">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And after Easter, I'll jump into the new area of what we're going to study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=129s">00:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to read with you as we wrap up the study, just to kind of give a, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=133s">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an overview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=134s">00:02:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll be very similar to the introduction that I gave three years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=137s">00:02:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews 10, 32 to 34, it says, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=143s">00:02:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you endured a great

your son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=194s">00:03:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In Jesus' name we pray, amen.</span></div><div

fellowship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=204s">00:03:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think we were expecting maybe about 30 people in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=208s">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">To our surprise, we actually have close to 70, over 50 at our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=213s">00:03:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We had about 56, 57, and then we had at least a dozen who were in that category but wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=220s">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">able to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=221s">00:03:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to our surprise, we actually have a lot more people than we thought that are over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=225s">00:03:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">50.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=228s">00:03:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically when people come to our church, it's like, "Yeah, it's all college students."</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=240s">00:04:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the interesting thing was, because we have older people at church, that our testimonies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=247s">00:04:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and our background is very diverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=250s">00:04:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We have people who've lived in different continents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=257s">00:04:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had actually two cancer survivors at our table, so we thought that would be unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=261s">00:04:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/691446690#t=262s">00:04:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when we presented it, we found that we had three other cancer survivors.</span></div><div
