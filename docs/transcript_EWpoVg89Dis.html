Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hello, hello. Hello, everybody. Glad you guys are able to make your way up. For those of you who are in the back hanging out, please begin making your way towards the front and take seats near the front as much as possible. And if you could hear me from the foyer and in the entry area, if you're already registered, go ahead and make your way over.</p><p>We're going to give people just some extra time to get situated, and then we will start the praise and prayer portion of it in just a couple more moments. But again, for those of you guys who can hear me on the outside, please make your way in. Thank you so much.</p><p>Let's pray over that topic together. Lord, we know that when you envision and picture your people, you see people who are longing for you with everything that they have, with all of their might, with all their mind and their soul. And I pray, Father God, that we as a church would be a people who is not embarrassed of you, but rather with full vulnerability, seeking you with every ounce of energy we have.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that if any of us are just weary, perhaps we lack confidence because we failed too many times, help us just to recognize that none of that matters because you deserve our worship in any moment. Whether we feel strong or we feel weak, we recognize, Lord God, that does not matter, because, Lord, to us, it is always a blessing to be in your presence.</p><p>For, God, being in your presence is restoration, it's strength, it's everything. And so I pray, Father God, no matter what state we're in, no matter what baggage we come to this place, I pray, Lord, that we would seek you. We would seek you in truth and in spirit. And, Lord, I pray, Father Lord, that as we do that, we would recognize to us the sweetest joys is with you.</p><p>So, Lord, even as we sing these songs and we lift up these prayers, I pray that it would be the desire of our heart to meet you intimately. We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. As we continue with worship through song, you may remain seated.</p><p>And just as we have prayed about seeking and desiring the Lord together, let us sing the song, "As the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after thee." ♪ ♪ ♪ As the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after thee. ♪ ♪ You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.</p><p>♪ ♪ You're my friend and you are my brother, even though you are a king. ♪ ♪ I love you more than any other, so much more than anything. ♪ ♪ You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. ♪ ♪ You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.</p><p>♪ I want you. ♪ I want you more than gold or silver, only you can satisfy. ♪ ♪ You alone are the real joy-giver and the apple of my eye. ♪ You alone. ♪ You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. ♪ ♪ You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.</p><p>♪ You alone. ♪ You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. ♪ ♪ You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee. ♪ ♪ And I long to worship thee. ♪ Amen. So at this time we are going to transition into a different format of prayer.</p><p>I'm going to ask Pastor Nate to come up and he's going to represent us in a topic, just praying for our ready hearts. Because of the nature of the topic of the retreat, we're going to be given a lot of exhortation and even practical exhortation of what to do about our relationships.</p><p>So we want to be praying over, let's see, Pastor Nate are you here? There you are, okay. Please come on up. He's going to be leading us in praying over, just making sure that our hearts are ready to obey and follow those exhortations. So as he prays, please just follow along in your hearts when we pray together.</p><p>Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we do want to be obedient. And Lord, we so often take your words and we treat them as rules. Things that we're just supposed to follow along, but God we sing a song to you right now. God, you are our heart's desire. Father, what you love is what we love.</p><p>What you want is what we want. Would you cause in us, Lord, a great obedience that comes because of our great love for you. Father, we take a moment tonight to look out at all the things that we've been following. All the things that we've been obeying. And God, we take this night to declare our obedience to you alone.</p><p>God, you're our God. You're our Lord. You're our master. You are our everything. Father, there is no other God in our lives but you. God, we hate the idols that we've set up. We hate God, the filth that is around. And Lord, we look to you and we remember.</p><p>God, that you look upon us. And God, you alone have given us life. You've given us hope. And so, God, we obey you because we want to. God, we want to give you our lives. Help us. Because we can't do this apart from your help. Spirit, we ask you to come inside and work your work.</p><p>Transform us. Discipline us. Change us. Make us more like the Jesus we love. Father, please help us. We want this so badly in our lives. And God, we are so prone to wander. We're so prone, God, to take our eyes off of you. And so, Lord, let this happen not as we force humility upon ourselves, that we want to just cut ourselves down and force ourselves to obey.</p><p>But, God, that we would truly see you as you are. God, we would remember that all creation bows down before you. All creation, God, adores you, listens to you. You speak and everything listens. It is only the human God that might disobey. And, Lord, we no longer want to be like that.</p><p>We are changed people. We are kingdom people. And so, Father, we want to fall in line. We want to hear your word and love it. We want it to be sweet to our ears. And we want God to be something that we leave declaring with joy and praise and gratitude.</p><p>Lord, we're going to hear some hard stuff this retreat. And so, God, when we hear from your word and it tells us to reconcile, that you have given to us the ministry of reconciliation, I pray, that we would go and obey. Father, would this place be a place filled with people who desire truly to live in reconciliation with others, that we might extend the love that you've shown to us to others.</p><p>And so, God, we want you to really be honored and glorified in our lives. We want you, God, to be so happy with us. And so, Lord, we lay these things down before you. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thank you. And I invite Elder James to come up.</p><p>He's going to be praying over Dr. Street. He's here with his wife, Janie. And as you know, again, we're going to be doing a lot of things during the retreat. But the focal point is for us to hear the exhortation from the truth. So, Elder James, please come and pray for boldness and conviction from the preaching.</p><p>All right, let's pray, guys. Lord, we thank you, Lord God, for Professor John Street as we delve into this topic of biblical reconciliation. Father, we know that particularly now, Lord, there is so much confusion with this idea of reconciliation. There is man who is trying to reconcile with man on their own without you, which we know it is completely impossible, Lord.</p><p>And so, Lord, as children of God who have truth, Father, as we are being molded and shaped by it, Lord, as we have our minds and our hearts ready and fertile to receive these messages, help us, Lord God, to learn to be attentive but to also apply, Lord, to apply these messages in our lives, to show the world, Father, what true reconciliation looks like, and that is only in Jesus Christ.</p><p>And so as we adorn the gospel message in our individual lives, help us, Lord God, as a church to stand strong in particularly these dark times, Father. So we pray for Professor John Street. We pray that you will be with him. We pray that you would give him conviction and boldness in his speaking.</p><p>We pray that we know that he has an ongoing teaching ministry. We pray that you will bless that as well. And so as we welcome Professor John Street, help us, Lord God, to receive him as family because that's what he is. We pray all these things in the name of your son.</p><p>Amen. Amen. And as a final topic, Elder Joe, if you would come up. You know, again, there's a lot of times for us to join in small group. As you guys know, even the children, they're having a retreat of their own with lessons and things like that. So just desiring God to bless everything and make things fruitful.</p><p>Make sure as Elder Joe prays, let's join our hearts to lift up the entire retreat. Let's pray together. Father, thank you, Lord, for you said in 2 Peter that you've given us every spiritual blessing in Christ. We have the gospel. And yet, Lord God, you're so gracious to us.</p><p>You've given us even this time to gather as the body of Christ in this place, Lord God, to retreat away. And I thank you, Lord God, that I see so many brothers and sisters here who have come out to fellowship, to encourage one another, and to learn from your word.</p><p>I pray, Lord God, that it may be such a fruitful few days, Lord God, together. That our hearts, Lord God, may be knit together and stitched together, Lord God, as one. That our love for one another may continue to grow. Lord, we pray for the sessions, Lord God, that our minds may be ready, that our hearts may be ready to receive your word and to apply its truth in our lives.</p><p>Lord, it may be somewhat, as many other retreats have gone before, may physically get weary and tired, but I pray, Lord God, that our spiritual minds may be engaged. Lord God, that we can glean much from your word. That the blessings, Lord God, that you continue to pour out to undeserving people like ourselves.</p><p>It's just so amazing, Lord God, that you're faithful, even when we are disobedient children. But I pray, Lord God, that the times with Dr. Shreve may be sweet. We pray for the times of small groups together, Lord God, in our discussions, in the practical applications, how we think through just to live our lives according to your purposes and ways.</p><p>Lord, that you strengthen us, that you give us time to fruitful discussion, true fellowship in the midst of our brothers and sisters sharing together our lives. We pray, Lord God, as well for even just our children, Lord God, as they are meeting together. We know, Lord God, that there are many and continuing to grow in our children's ministry.</p><p>And I pray, Lord God, for all those who are assisting and volunteering and teaching, that you give them wisdom, that you give them the strength, Lord God, to pour into this next generation, Lord, that the gospel may be clear, that many of these children may come to Christ early as well.</p><p>But ultimately, Lord God, we're just so thankful again that you've gathered the church as we fellowship, as we have this extended time to fellowship and get to know one another. I pray, Lord God, that we may maximize it, that the people, Lord God, around us that we may not know, that we may be bold and meet each other, Lord God, as we share in this fellowship together as one body.</p><p>So I pray, Lord God, again, that you really stitch our hearts together this next few days, that it may be all for your glory. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. So before we conclude the evening by joining our voices for one final song, I'm going to invite Pastor Peter to come.</p><p>And just an encouragement as we approach the weekend. So Jason Choi is not here? Okay. Did you have something you needed to say? You're after me. Okay. All right, so I was asked to give a brief encouragement as we kick off our summer retreat. I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do this again.</p><p>Okay. So Jason obviously had been working like this is his full time job, you know, and all of the teams, like every little thing that's going on requires a lot of work behind the scenes. There's people who have, you know, just getting this site with the children, with snacks, just room assignments, small groups.</p><p>There's a lot of things that are going on. And so anybody who's ever served in any capacity at retreat, you know it requires a lot of work. But with the size of our retreat, everything is exponentially more difficult. So please be patient. If you don't know what's going on, you don't know where it's going, how come no one told us this, no one told us that, we ask you to suck it up.</p><p>Okay. Because there's a lot of work being done behind the scene. But because of the size of the retreat, it may be a little bit more difficult just to get anything done. Just to get, you know, we need to get people from here to that room. That in and of itself is a -- it requires a lot of work.</p><p>So try to be patient as much as possible. And thank the people who are serving behind the scene who have come earlier, who's, you know, missing sessions so that they can go help with the children, all of these things that are happening all at once. So please be patient and help us to do that.</p><p>And, again, like I said, I'm not kidding. I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do an all-church retreat after this just because of the size that we have. So let's try to milk this as much as possible so that we can years later look back and say, remember when we had our last summer retreat and how great it was?</p><p>So make sure that we have all our memories, you know, do the best that we can to make the best that we can for this retreat. One of the things that I wanted to encourage our church with is, as you guys know, our church has been growing. It's been growing for many years, but we're probably growing at a faster rate than we've ever in our church history.</p><p>Just -- I think right before the pandemic, we were hitting somewhere around high 500. Some weeks we were hitting like low 600. Our last Sunday was the largest attendance, physical attendance, outside of the online attendance. So we have some people who still haven't joined us yet, but we've had 776, I think, and that's the largest number that we had physically.</p><p>And this is with a lot of the college students who are not here, so we're expecting sometime in September and October that usually is our biggest attendance because of the college students who are coming in town. And so we are expecting to go over 800. So we've actually added a couple hundred during the pandemic.</p><p>And we don't think that this is going to slow down. And so in one sense it's exciting because God is bringing all different kinds of people to church and adding to the community. But at the same time, whenever the church grows, especially as it is growing now, there is a sense of anxiousness that comes over the staff and for all of us because when the church grows, when there is spiritual activity, there's always a counteractivity.</p><p>Satan is actively working, like the Bible says, like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. And when there is fruit being born, there will always be spiritual attack. And what I've seen through the years, where the attack typically comes from is from within. As much as we are concerned about what's going on in the government and California, and I know people have talked about moving to Texas and maybe we can make heaven on earth somewhere.</p><p>But usually when there is attack, it happens within the church. And so there's -- and usually the way it happens is through relational problems. You have certain things that you've kind of held grudge against people or maybe certain people rubbed you the wrong way or maybe certain people said something insensitive to you and then you kind of hold that in and then all of a sudden you get stressed and certain opportunities comes and then the fractures begin to happen.</p><p>And that's typically how Satan has worked and that's what I've seen through the years. And so the way that the church gets attacked is through relationships. And I'm pretty sure that if you've been in church for a while, you can attest to that. If you've been into other churches, you know, the greatest memories that you have of churches is also with people, but also the most painful things that we remember are also with people.</p><p>And so this topic that we're covering through this retreat, I think it's coming at a very timely time because our church is growing that we can easily just kind of find a few people that we're close with and then stiff arm everybody else. Especially those of you who have been at church for a while, you can get in the habit because you've made close friends at church already.</p><p>And so I have my friends, so all these new people that are coming, that's the responsibility for the leadership. Thank God I'm not you. And then you can kind of huddle and then you get in the habit of church where you have a few people that you've gotten to, like, that's your community, but you don't want anybody else inside your community.</p><p>And you've made a country club within the church. And so we need to make sure that we avoid that trap, that whether we are 600, 800, or larger than that, that we really want to build a community where God is honored. And God cannot be honored in our lives if we have a personal agenda of just having a few friends around us and we're not aware of what's going on spiritually with the people that are coming in.</p><p>Okay? And so this retreat will serve a great deal for that, I think, effectively, if you choose to do so. As we've been praying, Dr. Shree is going to be talking about reconciliation. When people ask me what's the hardest thing about pastoring, and I think it's no different than being a Christian.</p><p>It's just that I have added pressure because I have to speak in front of you regularly, and if I don't practice this, I will feel like a hypocrite, right? Because what is the greatest command? Love God, and second is like it, right? Love your neighbor as yourself. And so the greatest challenge has always been throughout the years is loving people that are hard to love.</p><p>Some of you are much easier to love. Some of you are -- require some work, right? And I'm not going to tell you who you are, right? And everybody has some people in their lives that it would be just easy. Your life would be so much less stressful if those people weren't around.</p><p>But God places those people in our lives for a reason. God said -- Jesus said that our primary identity as Christians is to practice the love that he practiced with us, unconditional love, right? Where he loves people who are hard to love, who are difficult to love, that we don't want to love, people who have wronged us.</p><p>And so if we don't practice our Christianity there, then everything else we do is hypocrisy. We can preach the gospel without practicing love. He says it's nothing. You can speak in tongues. You can lead. You can even give your body to be burned in the flame if you do not practice love.</p><p>He says it is for nothing. So at the core of what God calls us to do is to practice this agape love. It is probably the most sanctifying thing that we can do because it really tears at the core of our being. It tears at our pride. You cannot practice agape love if you retain your pride.</p><p>Nothing kills our pride more than practicing love with people who we don't want to practice love with, right? Nothing is more sanctifying, but also there's nothing that builds a church more than when a church practices a love that is not practiced outside of the church because they look at our church and they say, "Why are these people together?</p><p>How come they practice this kind of community that's so hard to build outside?" Because we have Christ, right? Because the love of Christ compels us. So I want to encourage you, just like as we've been praying, just like the theme is going to be, that you don't leave the retreat with a lot of themes, right, and a lot of, you know, teaching.</p><p>But how do we practice? What specific things, what specific people is God convicting you to reconcile with, to practice this love with? And so hopefully throughout the retreat that we may be able to do that, okay? So let me give you some practical things to practice, okay? First of all, while you are here, there's a reason why you have this lanyard or whatever you call this, okay, this plastic thing.</p><p>It has your names on it. If you're like me, you're not like -- I remember your face, but I probably asked some of you, maybe some of you have been offended. I asked you like four or five times, like, "Hey, nice to meet you." You say, "Oh, we've met already," right?</p><p>How many times? Like four times. So at some point, like I'm ashamed to ask because I don't want to offend you, so my inclination is to avoid you so that I don't have to be awkward with you. So there were long periods of our church growth where I was -- you know, it's because I met that person, but I remember their name, so I'm going to walk this way, right?</p><p>I've come to the conclusion that I can't do that anymore, right? It's better for me to offend you and to get to know you, even if it takes me four or five times, than to avoid you because it causes more problems down the line. So I want to encourage you to do the same.</p><p>Be awkward. If you don't remember, you know, just ask them. And that's why we have this. So I'm going to ask you to do your best while you're here to break the ice. You're not going to become best friends through two, three days of retreat, but at least when you go back to church that you're not just walking by people, you know, that you can say, hey, I remember you, or you can say, hey, we ate together, or we were in a small group together, or, you know, or we just passed by and happened to be in the same circle while we're talking, that next time you see them at church, that you can ask them, what's your name again?</p><p>You know what I mean? Even if it takes four or five times, right? Because if the church is going to be built, we have to know each other. We have to suffer together. We have to celebrate together. If we get in the habit of forming our cliques and then we have 20 friends and everybody else I don't know and I don't care to know, then the church is never going to change for you.</p><p>So do your best to get to know as many people as you can while you're here, even if it's awkward. I give you permission in the name of the Lord to be awkward at this retreat. Be as awkward with as many people as possible while you're here. Be deliberate about building friendships while you're here.</p><p>You're not going to be friends with everybody, but in your small group, with other couples, when you go out to eat, more than just small talk, if you get in the habit of just asking them, "What's going on in your life? How can I pray for you?" That's a really good way to break the ice.</p><p>And sometimes they'll give you just a general idea and sometimes they'll open up to you. And so you don't have to do that with everybody, but with the people that you've been assigned, do your best to really connect with them and not just to be in small group, not just to be in dinner, but to really get to know that person so when you come back that you'll have prayer requests to pray for when you go back home.</p><p>So I'm going to encourage you to be able to do that. Be intentional with your time here. We're only here for a few days. We have one full day tomorrow, and so we deliberately packed the schedule during the day, and then, again, Jason will probably go through more of that later on.</p><p>But what I say to be intentional is if you've been at church for a while and you already have a group of friends, and I know that it would be great to revisit with friends and reconnect with friends. I haven't been able to spend time with them like that.</p><p>You are surrounded by people who don't have that because our church is growing. There's so many people who have only been at our church for a month, six months, a year, two years, and so they don't have that kind of connection at church. So I want, especially for those of you who have been at our church for a couple years or longer, to be deliberate about people that you don't recognize.</p><p>Reach out to them. If you see somebody wandering around and you feel like they don't fit in anywhere, you know, be hospitable. That's one of the qualities that God calls leaders to be to have hospitality. So to be deliberate about your time. And along with that, those of you, especially those of you who are younger, okay, and not to say that this doesn't affect older people, but those of you who are younger, you know, you kind of remember retreats as a place to go hang out until 4 in the morning, you know what I mean, have fun, play games, and then you wake up and you're halfway falling asleep through the next session, but you make great friendships that way, right?</p><p>I'm not saying that, you know, like we have curfew at 10 o'clock, you should be home and sleeping, and you wake up 6 in the morning. I'm not -- there is no -- we don't have a timeline yet. Obviously, the hotel has things that you don't want to disturb other people.</p><p>If you're in a hotel room, try not to make noise in the hotel rooms because there's guests next door. We don't want them hating Christ because of you, okay? So if you're going to make noise, try to do it in this room. But at the same time, we want you to build friendships.</p><p>We want you to, you know, break the ice. But our primary reason why we're here is to connect with God, right? And so I want you guys to use your judgment, and if you have friends who are not using their judgment, please help them use their judgment, right, and to sleep at a godly time, right?</p><p>And whatever godly means, you use your own judgment, but try to make that your priority, right? And, again, we don't have a specific curfew, but try to be reasonable, okay? All right. And those of you who are a little bit older, try to stay up as long as you can, okay?</p><p>You're tempted to go in 9 o'clock and just go to sleep, okay? So we're not here for that long. So try to stay up and to connect with as many people as possible. You know who you are, okay? All right. And a couple more things. Dr. Street, I don't think is here yet, right?</p><p>Okay. We've already prayed for the -- you know, every once in a while when I do go to churches to speak, the most awkward time for me is in between, you know, in between because it depends on which church that I'm at, and I just kind of don't know what to do with myself, and so I just kind of float around.</p><p>And so I appreciate it when the people who are there, like, engage me. They would ask me questions and just kind of engage them and let them know. If you've heard something that was really encouraging, you don't have to sit there and, like, and have one-to-one with Dr. Street and his wife, but just say thank you.</p><p>You know, that really encouraged me. At the end of the retreat, that day would feel encouraged, right? Even though they may be physically drained, oftentimes I go to churches where they're engaging, and I come back more rejuvenated than when I first went. And so I hope that that would be the experience for our speakers as well.</p><p>So while they're here, even though they're laboring for us at the end of the retreat, that through our interaction, through us thanking them, engaging them, that they would find encouragement through the time that we have here. Again, this is something that I'd be encouraging all of us to do.</p><p>And then one final thing before I give this over to Jason. The morning devotions that we have, Jason's going to tell us the timeline, but again, if you go to sleep at a godly time, you're going to wake up at a godly hour, and then we can have godly devotions, right?</p><p>You go to bed at an ungodly time, you're not going to wake up at an ungodly hour, and you're going to have ungodly devotion, all right? So your devotion is going to start at sleep. Get enough sleep. Some of you guys require less than others. And especially those of you who are younger, you are sleeping with other people.</p><p>You're in a quad room, and you're like, "Oh, I'm a night owl," but the other three are not, right? So be courteous to other people while you're there, and then please try to come early in the morning, wherever you are, to prepare your hearts so that that will set the tone for the rest of the day, right?</p><p>What you do in the morning is going to set the tone for what you're preparing for the rest of the day. So if you don't prepare in the morning, you're probably going to have that attitude for the rest of the day. So I want to highly encourage you to take that time seriously.</p><p>Make the most of the retreat that we have together, okay? All right. If I can give that to Jason. All right. Thank you, Pastor Peter, for those words of encouragement. Speaking of morning devotions, guys, so this room will be open at 6.30 a.m. Morning devotions start at 7 a.m., but it's open at 6.30 a.m.</p><p>for you guys to come in. Breakfast for the volunteers will be open at 7.45 a.m., but for the rest of everybody else, it's 8 a.m. for you guys to come for breakfast. One big announcement. We posted it on the bulletin, and we posted it on Facebook page as well.</p><p>I believe Sarah notified all the parents, but the nursery seats time tomorrow will extend into Q&A, and Q&A will end at 4.30 approximately. So parents, please plan accordingly to make sure after the Q&A session ends, you guys hurry up and pick up your kids right after, okay? The Oasis area, which is to my right, your left, do not enter that area.</p><p>That's another group that will be here over the same weekend. We have from the Rancho Mirage area into the Celebrity Room, okay? Please try not to enter the Oasis area. And speaking of that, looking around, my observation is that the hotel might be a little bit short-staffed, plus due to some restrictions, they're not always going to be here constantly.</p><p>So if you guys notice, things are getting a bit messy, you know, like the bathrooms or the trash areas, and especially where the snacks are, you know, just try to clean up after yourselves and do everything in a very orderly fashion, especially the snacks area, you guys. Don't ravage it.</p><p>Just wait for one another. Just stand in line. And we have plenty of snacks to go around, okay? You guys don't have to worry about any shortages. There's a Costco like a mile and a half from here. We'll always get more, okay? And we punish everything. We have hot water for the ramen right back there for you guys who really love Korean ramen.</p><p>Okay, for those of you staying at the Fairfield, please do check in if you haven't done so already. But I do want to let you know that there's going to be a devotion room for you guys as well, but it's only 25-person max. So if you guys--if it fills up fast, you guys can come here, or you guys can do devotions in your room or the pool area or the common area in the Fairfield Hotel, okay?</p><p>Oh, okay. Lastly, after Peter comes up and does a closing prayer, if all the small group leaders-- if you are a small group leader and you're here, right after that ends, just please come up real quick. For those of you who don't know who your small group leader is, you guys can open the Facebook app or go onto the e-mails.</p><p>We've been sending tons of logistical e-mails, and you guys can see or identify from their profile photo that we have for you guys, okay? They'll be standing up here real quick for about-- if you guys don't mind just standing around up here for the last few minutes afterwards, that would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>All right, I think that's it. Okay, praise team. Okay, so as the praise team comes up, let's all rise from our seats together. Please join me in a word of prayer as we pray over our church as a whole, and then we'll close off the evening with one song that we'll sing to the Lord.</p><p>So let's pray. God, beyond just this weekend, Pastor Peter gave us this challenge and encouragement thinking about the growth of our church. And, Lord, we know that you are our Heavenly Father, and you see the church as your spiritual family with us being your children. And so, God, I pray that we would see it as such a joy to be in your house, and, God, the brothers and sisters that we have, we ought to love one another as you have loved us.</p><p>And so, God, with the application then being not just one thing, but, God, in our hearts' attitude, help us, Lord, to edify and build each other up with a kind of conviction, Lord, we are a part of the same household of God. And so, Lord, we lift up our entire church to you, not just this weekend, but for the years ahead as we grow, that we would grow in the right way, Lord, that it would reflect truly your design.</p><p>We thank you, Lord, and lift this song up to you. It's in Christ's name. Amen. How great the chasm that lay between us How high the mountain I could not climb In desperation I turned to heaven Spoke your name into the night Then through the darkness your loving kindness Tore through the shadows of my soul The work is finished, the end is written Jesus Christ, my living hope You're my living hope Who could imagine so great a mercy What heart could cleave such boundless grace The God of ages stepped down from glory To wear my sin and bear my shame The cross has spoken, I am forgiven The King of kings calls me his own Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever Jesus Christ, my living hope Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning You have broken every chain There's salvation in your name Jesus Christ, my living hope Then came the morning that sealed the promise Your buried body began to breathe Out of the silence the roaring lion Declared the grave has no claim on me Then came the morning that sealed the promise Your buried body began to breathe Out of the silence the roaring lion Declared the grave has no claim on me Jesus, yours is the victory Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning You have broken every chain There's salvation in your name Jesus Christ, my living hope Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning You have broken every chain There's salvation in your name Jesus Christ, my living hope Jesus Christ, my living hope Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh God, you are my living hope All right, let's say one final prayer.</p><p>Our God, we want to place all of our faith and our hope in you. And Lord, we will pray, Father God, again for this weekend. We pray that you would make the most of all the opportunities that we have. And in so doing, Lord God, I truly honor you.</p><p>We thank you, God, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen. All right, everybody, we hope that you have some godly rest at a godly time. And then see you in the morning at 7. Small group leaders, please make sure that you come up here for a brief moment so that we can make sure to introduce you guys.</p><p>So if the small group leaders could quickly come up. We'll give you a few minutes. For any of you guys who don't know which small group you belong to, take a quick glance up here to see who they are. I'm going to go through their names so that you guys-- just in case you don't know what they look like.</p><p>On the left, we have Paul Pack, Mitchell Kim, Rachel Kang, Luke Kang, Sean Tang, Pastor Nate Kwok, Richard Lee, James Hong,</p></div></body></html>
