href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=36s">00:00:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're looking at the last passage for the book of Colossians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=41s">00:00:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Next week is our overview study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=43s">00:00:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I have questions on the bottom, which I'm going to review with you before I finish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=50s">00:00:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So next week, just kind of, you know, just follow the directions and try to answer as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=54s">00:00:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">much of these as you can on the bottom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=56s">00:00:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But today we're going to be finishing up the book of Colossians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=60s">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably weird that we're taking a whole Bible study that's just to study the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=65s">00:01:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">three verses or three, four verses just filled with names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=70s">00:01:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, typically when we go through these names, we don't really dig too deep because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=74s">00:01:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you just think, well, just Paul's saying bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=76s">00:01:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But these names are on there for a purpose, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=79s">00:01:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the reason why we're taking, you know, taking some time to go through these names</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=83s">00:01:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">by step by step is because we see what the early church was like when you see the testimonies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=89s">00:01:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of these people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=91s">00:01:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these are things that typically that when you mention Titchicus or Archippus or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=95s">00:01:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nymphus, you know, you mentioned that, that that doesn't even come up in Bible trivia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=101s">00:01:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people don't know these names, but they are people's names on the Bible for a reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=106s">00:01:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So today I broadly divided the section that we're looking at into two parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=112s">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the two main parts is insight that we gained from this, what the early church was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=118s">00:01:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=119s">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=120s">00:02:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second part is the writing and spreading of the New Testament letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=124s">00:02:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=126s">00:02:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Writing and spreading of the New Testament letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=127s">00:02:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we get some insight through this last part of Colossae, what the early church was like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=132s">00:02:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing, the church that he mentioned, the Laodicean church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=138s">00:02:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we want to jump into it more specifically, but Laodicea is one of the churches that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=145s">00:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned in the seven churches in the book of Revelation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=149s">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well Colossae is the very next city right underneath that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=154s">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the closest city to Laodicea is Colossae.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=156s">00:02:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul addresses the Laodicean brothers, but the Laodicean, if you remember, what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=161s">00:02:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Laodicean church known for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=163s">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Lukewarmness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=164s">00:02:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was the cause of the lukewarmness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=167s">00:02:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=171s">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Their riches, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=172s">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they said, you say you are rich and I have become wealthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=178s">00:02:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, and then Jesus basically turns that around, but in actuality you're really poor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=182s">00:03:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and wretched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=183s">00:03:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And he turns the table around and says, your self-reliance has actually made you dull to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=188s">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=189s">00:03:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so the indictment against them was lukewarmness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=192s">00:03:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So Laodicean church was considered a very wealthy church and Colossae was right underneath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=197s">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=199s">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Colossae also was a very prominent city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=202s">00:03:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the lot of activity was taking place right around that area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=208s">00:03:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=209s">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=210s">00:03:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the primary thing that was going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=212s">00:03:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What is that area called?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=214s">00:03:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Something minor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=215s">00:03:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Asia minor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=218s">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Asia minor, there was a lot of activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=221s">00:03:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a, what was the, one of the main things that was going on in this area that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=225s">00:03:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, Apostle Paul was concerned about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=227s">00:03:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=228s">00:03:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=230s">00:03:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything in particular?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=233s">00:03:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The Judaizers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=236s">00:03:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The Judaizers were having a huge impact in this area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=242s">00:04:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Paul was very concerned about Laodicea, Galatia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=246s">00:04:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, when he writes Galatia, he says the same thing, to make sure that you spread this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=249s">00:04:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">letter that everybody reads it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=252s">00:04:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=253s">00:04:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Nympha was probably a wealthy person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=257s">00:04:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let me...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=260s">00:04:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I forgot one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=263s">00:04:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The churches were usually a small in number and met in people's homes until the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=267s">00:04:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">third century, meaning they were house churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=271s">00:04:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if they had big homes, they wouldn't have been able to fit hundreds of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=276s">00:04:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So most churches that Paul is referring to is probably house churches that may have fit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=282s">00:04:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if it was big, maybe 20 people, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=285s">00:04:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that would be considered a big house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335049976#t=287s">00:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Most average homes at that time probably only could fit about 10 to 15,
