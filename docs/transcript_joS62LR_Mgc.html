They don't receive any kind of honor in the church. He said the church should not look like the world, right? Church, it neutralizes whatever pride, whatever ambition that you had before you met Christ, you come to church and all of a sudden we get reoriented to what is good and what is bad.</p><p>That's what he's saying. This community should not look like lunchtime in high school, right? So he says we give them special honor because they need it. We bestow more abundant honor. Our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</p><p>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. If one member is honored, all the members rejoice, right? That we are to be one so much to the point we genuinely suffer when other people suffer. When we're distant, we stiff-arm everybody. We kind of, when somebody suffers, it's like, "Oh, too bad.</p><p>Oh, thumbs down." And that's about the degree of empathy that you show because you don't have any connection with that person. When they rejoice, it's like, "Oh, great, great." And that's about it. But he says, "No." He says, "Be so connected to the church that when one person suffers, that we all suffer together, right?" And as the church gets bigger, when we were a smaller church, this was easier because there was a lot more interaction, right?</p><p>But as the church gets bigger, all the more why we need to be deliberate about this because it doesn't happen automatically in a bigger church, right? We have to make an effort. You yourself are not gonna get to know everybody in the church, but if everybody makes an effort to do this, right, if everybody practices this, then the community of the church will look very different, right?</p><p>Where we want to be a community, whether we are a thousand, whether we are ten thousand, that when somebody suffers, we suffer together. When somebody rejoices, we learn to rejoice together, and we can't do that if we ignore the gathering of the church, okay? Discussion question. How has your current walk with God either helped or hindered your fellowship with others?</p><p>When was the last time you gave up your freedom for the purpose of building up someone else's faith? Do you have a difficult time addressing someone else's sin, right? How do you know when you are being judgmental versus being careful to restore a struggling Christian? That's a very practical question, right?</p><p>Like some people say, "I'm speaking the truth," right? Somebody needs to speak up, but how do you know when you are more of speaking truth and not love? Or you got somebody else saying like, "Oh, but we need to be more gracious and loving," but you never confront sin.</p><p>How do you balance this where you're doing, you're speaking the truth in love, right? Because true fellowship requires both. Then four, when was the last time you experienced true biblical fellowship according to what was taught today, right? Where it is Christ-centered, other-centered, holiness producing, right? And building up the body of Christ.</p><p>What can you do to facilitate genuine fellowship with other members of Berean? So wherever you may be, you may be sitting and saying, "Oh, Berean, oh, I'm Berean," right? Most frustrating person is when their happiness is based upon other people changing. That person will be frustrated all their life.</p><p>Because as soon as one problem gets fixed, they're gonna find someone else that needs to be fixed. So if your joy is based upon other people and something outside of you changing for you to be joyful, you will never be joyful, right? Application should always be with me. So if I want to see biblical fellowship, don't say, "The church needs to do this, the church needs to do that." What do you need to do, right?</p><p>What do you need to do to affect the fellowship around you? So that's question number four, okay? Let me pray for us and then I'll let you get into your group. Father, we pray that your Word that you taught us would bear fruit in our hearts and I pray that the discussion would lead to a greater surrender of ourselves and to look out for others and consider others better than ourselves, that Christ may be exalted, that the church may be built according to your purpose and will.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Hey, did you guys get the email with the slides? I heard that you couldn't see it. Is that true? The slide works but is it all in white with white background? But most people are going to see it through their phones though. Okay, all right, okay.</p><p>It works but...</p></div></body></html>
