This year we're introducing some new characters. To our right is Detective Friday and Sammy of the BIS, the Marine Investigative Services. Detective Friday and Sammy are trying to keep busy around the office. They haven't had a case in years. To our left lives Mrs. Buttersworth. She's been travel camping through Redwood National Forest and is making her way back to Miami, Florida. Look at all the boxes she's unpacking for her trip. Let's join them to find out what happens next. Oh, oh Sammy. We haven't had a case in years. I mean we're supposed to be detectives but, I mean look at us. Our whole office is so dirty. And look at our trophies covered in dust. Dust and shiny dust. I mean it's so dusty. I think it's time for you to get the Swiffer and just start dusting while I look through some cases that are interesting for us, you know? Hey ma'am. I don't know. I just heard this bug crash while I was looking at some bobcats in the area and found you here. Oh my stuff. Who would do such a thing? It's everywhere. Where's my treasure? Where's my treasure? Treasure? Um. Oh, nature's glowing. Wait, where are you going? Where's my treasure? You know, what is my treasure? Okay, okay, you know. Detective Joe. Detective Friday. Hello? Private Investigator Friday opens five days a week starting Friday. Nice. Thanks for calling. Hi, my name is Mrs. Wattersworth and you know, I've seen you lost something of great importance to me, you know, actually a treasure really. Wait, a treasure? Are we talking about a treasure? Like fine china or maybe even jewelry? No, no, no. It's much more important to me than that. Do you think we can meet in person? Sure. How did you hear about us? Actually, you know, I heard a bit from a friend of a friend named Detective Joe at the Irma Police Department. Oh, okay. Detective Joe. Great. I'll let you know our estimated time of arrival. Great. See you soon. Alright, let's go. We're finally here. Wait, and you are? Hi, I'm Mrs. Wattersworth. Oh, hi. My name is Detective Nemesis, I mean, Detective Friday and this is my mini, I mean, my assistant, Sammy. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Hey, so what happened? Why did you call us here? Okay, well, you know, I was cleaning up some stuff around my campsite and I kind of tripped on some boxes because I fell. But then, you know, I can't find my treasure and I think I must have hit my head kind of hard because I don't even remember what my treasure is. That's why I called. Oh, thanks for calling. I mean, we can help look for your treasure right now. I mean, that's what we do. Okay, good. Alright, perfect. Let's go. Let's get started. Is it this? No. Wait, I don't know what this is, but this has to be it. I don't know if that is even actually. What about this? No, but I'm actually looking for this. Thank you. Wait, I found it. It's a shoe. That's not even mine. Oh. Oh. Oh my gosh, I found it. No, that's not it either. That has to be it. Look at how big that diamond is. You know, it's not even that big. Can I have it back? No, I didn't say you could have it. Wait, so if it's not that huge diamond and it's not that weird looking shoe, then when was the last time you saw this treasure of yours? Actually, I was moving some stuff and then putting it here and then over there and then. Oh, I forgot one more spot. Oh my gosh, sea flower princess pretty. Is it going to have any fruits? Actually, yeah, it's going to have the sweetest and the brightest fruit ever. Wait, what kind of seed is she used for? I mean, look at how it's growing these flowers out. Yeah, you know, it's from a bubblegum tree. Yeah, you know, it grows in East Africa, actually. East Africa, huh? Yeah, and when it first begins to grow or when they first plant it, the seed is super small, like super duper small. It's as tiny as a mustard seed, but then it grows so fast. You know, I actually grew this yesterday. Wait, what? Did I hear you say that right? You grew that tree from this small mustard seed to that tree in one night? How is that possible? It must be the water. The only thing that can grow that fast is the water. No, it's not the water. What? It's not even the seed. It's actually the soil. The soil, that's it? Wait, the soil is your treasure? You're funny. So you can't just dive down and what, like dive in it or something? No, soil is not my treasure. It's a clue, though. Wait, I think I just solved it. Or just kidding, I think I just found the clue. I think the clue is the soil. Good job, Detective May. I just said that. I can't wait to see what I will find next time.  The end.   It has been quite an interesting day so far. Mrs. Buttersworth, a wealthy lady, has forgotten where she's placed her most prized possession after she tripped on her shoelaces and injured her head with a bunch of boxes. All alone and with no memory of where she has been placed her true treasure, she hires a team of professional detectives. Detective Friday and Sammy have come from the big city in their trusty car to Redwood National Park to help. Will they be one step closer to finding Mrs. Buttersworth's missing treasure? Let's find out. Have you found anything? No, I haven't really found anything yet. Hmm, I love this. Hmm, this is interesting. Interesting, have you found anything yet? Are you jealous? I haven't found anything. Oh, there it is. Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I'm okay. Where's Detective Friday? Hey, good to see you. Do you want to help me look for treasure? Hey guys, any luck? I haven't found anything, but I met this person. He's helping me. She's Detective Friday. Oh yes. I see you found my wig. Yes, I found that wig. I thought it matched my mustache quite well actually. But this is me. There's just so many boxes here. I don't think we're able to go through all of these boxes to find the treasure. I think we need to split up and look for it. What do you guys think? Yes! Okay. Oh, I found something. What's this box? It's got Uncle Mortimer on it. That's my Uncle Mortimer stuff. Mortimer? I think I have a portrait of him somewhere. Wait, what's inside? What? What's behind this? Oh, Uncle Mortimer, there you are. You're so dirty.  You know what? You know, Uncle Mortimer lived quite an interesting life and at one point, a very reckless life. Here, I'll tell you his story.  Uncle Mortimer is my great uncle. He came from a very wealthy family. His father was kind, honest, and just. Unfortunately, one day, his daughter found out he had a bad friend and decided she no longer wanted to live in his father's house. So, he went to his father and demanded for an inheritance. It went way like this. Oh, my son, what a pleasure to see you. Something up the matter? Father, I want my inheritance money. I want to see the world. I want to eat fine dining. I want to live my life. Son, it's a dangerous world out there. You must be careful. Don't be reckless. Father, I want my money now. Yeah. Money. Mula. Monero. Chedda. Oh, fine dining. Fine. Gasol, I will take one of these sprinkled beauties. So delicate, so delicious. More food? Yes. Yes, more food. Very delicious. I have to pay first. Very tasty. Yes. More, more, more. It's got a deadly flavor. Oh, yes. That's great. Yes. Let me get it. Let me get it. I've got no more money. Unfortunately, Uncle Molo spent his money on fine dining. He soon found himself homeless and living on the street. Eating food thrown out of the restaurant. Trash. Oh, it's food. This fish doesn't even have any meat on this bone. Oh, an apple. Somebody ate it. Pizza, pizza. It smells like cardboard. A donut. A sprinkled beauty. Somebody ate it. And there's a hair on it. And a bug. I'm going to eat it anyways because I'm so hungry. Finally, Uncle Mortimer knew what he had to do. He had to go home. He knew what he had done was wrong. And he was very ashamed. But he remembered his father. What am I doing? I'm hungry. I'm dirty. I'm homeless. I need to apologize. I need to say sorry to my dad. I could work for him as a servant. I don't deserve to be a son. I will go find him. I will go back home. Uncle Mortimer's father had been searching for him this whole time. When he saw his son at a distance, he ran to meet him. There he is. My son, you are home. Father! I missed you. I missed you, Father. Oh, yes, I am so famished. You know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of the prodigal son. The prodigal son. That's it. It's another clue. You know, before we start looking again, I'm going to celebrate us finding the second clue with another cup of tea. All right. Man, that was crazy. I can't believe the story of Uncle Mortimer. Man, he stole all of his father's money and he spent it all in one day. How crazy is that? Yeah, I can't believe his father welcomed him back after all of that. I mean, I think he's really mad. You know, I kind of wish I had a father like that. I mean, even though I did all of those bad things and still my father is just an--I mean, such an unconditional lover, you know? I wish I had somebody that could just love me unconditionally like that. I don't think I've ever met a person who loves someone like that. You know, you're right. I mean, unfortunately, we weren't able to solve or find Mrs. B's treasure today, but luckily we were able to find the first clue yesterday with the soil. And today we found our second clue, which was the prodigal son. Man, hopefully we find our treasure tomorrow.  Spend the night in the woods. We've discovered two clues so far, the seed and the soil on day one, the story of the prodigal son, Uncle Mortimer, on day two. The detectives still haven't discovered what this treasure is, but they're determined. Sammy can't seem to sleep this morning. After what they discovered yesterday, she's really stuck on finding out what the treasure is. Will today be the day they find out Mrs. Buttersworth's treasure, or will we simply find more clues? Let's find out.   Top of the morning, Sammy. Looks like you beat the sun. I was just trying to figure out where Mrs. B's treasure could be. Sammy, Sammy, the only way to really start the morning is with a box of sprinkle beauties. Donuts! Who wants one? You want one? Donut for you! Donut for you! We've got all kinds! I mean, I mean, it must be really amazing. She has all of this stuff, but it means nothing to her compared to this treasure. You're telling me? Maybe I should just take a break. I'm so tired. I love this place. It's so quiet. Yeah, it's pretty beautiful. You know what goes well with a beautiful place like this? A box of sprinkle beauties! Let's get another one! Really?  Right there! There's a bug! There's a bug on you! There's a bug! There's a bug! I got it! I got it! I got it! Oh, oh, it's just a bug. Don't worry, I got it off you. Sorry, Sammy, let me help you up. Here, have another donut to replenish your energy. You sure? Suit yourself. These are some of the best donuts I've had in my life. Seriously, I mean, talk about perfection. In donuts, there's sprinkles and there's glaze. And then more sprinkles and then glaze. And then sprinkles! Where did my donut go? Huh? Look, Detective, it's a cute little kitty. Oh my gosh! Sammy! Sammy!  Oh my gosh! Sammy, are you okay? Sit right here. Man, I'm having a rough day already. Tell you what, I'm going to go look for my lost donut. And why don't you sit here, okay?  Oh my gosh, what happened here? I've been attacked by these creatures! I guess they thought I was an octopus and a bug. Oh, you know, did that vicious cat attack you? Ugh, you know, his appearances can be very deceiving. Yes, and this octopus would have attacked me too. You think Bubbles would have attacked you? Oh, no, no, Bubbles is such a gentle dog.  Oh, my donut. Thank you. You know, Bubbles has such a kind heart.  The heart! You know, that's another clue!   Give our script team a big hand!  Yesterday, Detective Friday and Sammy weren't aware of the creatures that lived in the woods with Mrs. Butterworth. Who would have thought that an innocent-looking cat could be such a grub, and a big, slimy octopus be a gentle, loving creature? Detective Friday and Sammy learned that it was the heart that showed the true nature inside each of us. Will Sam and Friday finally discover the treasure their heart is seeking after?  Sammy, there you are. It's awfully dangerous out here. Did you bring the special stuff? Right here, boss. Good. Let's go. Okay. Do you see anything? No. You? I see him. He's just looking at me.   Sammy, you scared me! What are you doing? I don't know. What are you doing? Oh, my goodness!  Where is he? Oh, my goodness! Not you, monster! Sammy, hit him! Hit him, Sammy! Hit him with the frying pan! That's right. You got it good. Is it dead? Oh, my goodness.  It's... this is Butterworth. What are you doing out here? You need to be careful. There are dangerous creatures out here, such as wombats, button bugs, and frying pans.  No. Oh, my goodness. My puzzle. Oh, no. Oh, no. Here, we'll help you. We'll help you put it together. Don't worry. We can do it.  You know, it's okay. I can picture on my phone what the puzzle used to look like.  You know... Whoa. Geez, things really fly around here. Anyways, you know...  Something just... I'm bored as a leaf frog. Oh, good find. Anyways, you know, this puzzle was a gift from my grandma, who's a Christian. You know, when I was younger, she used to read me stories from the Bible. You guys know the Barbers, right? Oh, that song. The Bible. That's that TV show. Oh, yeah! The one with all the vegetables. No, that's a legend, you know. It's not the Bible. Oh. But anyways, you know, the Bible talks about God and his plan to restore the relationship between him and his creation.  But you know, mankind sinned, and so now... No, the first man sinned, so now all mankind are sinners. You know, we're lawbreakers, thieves, and liars, but we're without hope and without rest. Even a little fuzzy lie? Well, you know, a little lie is still a lie against a holy God. But we can always just try our best and be the worst-becoming person. Unfortunately, Sammy, good works is not enough. We have sin inside of us, so everything we do is stained by our sin. The punishment for sin is death. Either we or a sacrifice must die to take the sins away from us. Um... Yes, that one goes right there. Yes. Perfect. But you know, God had a plan, so he sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross for us to take away our sins. Jesus Christ is known as the Good Shepherd, and we are known as sheep. When he calls, we follow. I think we have every move now. Just three more. One... Two... Three. Three! Perfect! Yay! We did it! What is it? "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Matthew 6, 21. Guys, this is the final clue! Good job, guys. You know, it's kind of late, though. I think I'm going to turn in. Alrighty. Good night! Good night. Thank you again. Good night. Do you think we're any closer to finding our treasure? Hmm... Hard to say. Hmm... What do you think about what she said, though? If everything we do is stained by our sin and our hard work could never be enough, then we could never be made friends with God. What do we do now?  Follow Jesus? Sammy, do you think I can do this? Hmm...   Alright, kids. Detective Brian and Sammy have been looking everywhere, and we still haven't found the clues. Hi, Miss Narrator. Um, we're just a little bit confused. So we've been thinking about what the treasure is, and we just can't figure it out. Do you think we can get some help? Yeah, it would be really nice if we could, like, find some kids who have maybe, like, gone to BBS or something, you know? Yeah. Hmm... I guess we went to BBS. Oh, you guys can help us! Can you guys help us find the treasure?  Thank you. Alright, join the team. Come on. Now, you guys gotta keep it down, though, because Mrs. Buttersworth is sleeping. She can't wake up. So, where should we start? Well, what was the first clue?  A bear? Where? I don't like bears. Oh, it's okay, Detective. Come back. It looks like a nice, friendly bear. Hi, Mr. Bear. Do you want to help us? Yeah, I think you can help us. Oh! The soil! You're right. The Word of God is like the seed, and a person's heart is like the soil. Yes. The good and strong soil produces good and strong fruits, remember? Hmm... Well, then... What's the second clue?  Oh, yeah! Uncle Mortimer! And the prodigal son!  I'm a sinner, remember? I sinned against the Holy God. But I've been forgiven because I repented. Great job, kids. If we have a ready heart and repent and leave our sin, we can find forgiveness, too. So, then... What's clue number three?  The donut! The donut's clue number three! Wait, what? Yeah, right? Oh, wait... Never mind. Oh! But what's the word? A good heart produces good fruits, but a bad heart produces bad, grumpy cat fruit. That's right. It was the heart. Hmm... And then, I think there was one more. Yeah. What was clue number four?  Oh! Clue number four was my puzzle, remember? Oh! "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Matthew 6, 21. Matthew 6, 19-20. "Do not lay up for yourselves treasure on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and what these break-ins do. But lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven." Treasure! Treasure's in heaven! That's it! The kingdom of heaven! Yeah, because the treasure is greater than anything found on earth. Thus, the treasure must be the kingdom of heaven! We found the treasure!  Let's go!       Oh! (LAUGHTER)</p></div></body></html>
