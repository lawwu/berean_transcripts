As we go. Okay. Great. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I'd like to just go before the Lord. Pray for his blessing. Father, we want to thank you again. And Lord, we know that actually your word you have said is really clear. In some sense, God, you just, you've repeated yourself and your teaching over and over again to us. So it is our prayer, God, that whenever we see it, Lord, that we would be moved to conviction. We would be moved to incredible trust. And God, would you also challenge us then to greater measures of applying those things into our lives. We thank you again for the ministry of your word. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. So by way of brief just review and an overview of the paragraph that we're looking at. Remember that Apostle Paul was essentially asking them this to compare and contrast. And before you were like this, you were like a child. Before you didn't even know God, you didn't even perceive him. But now that you know him, how can you go back to slavery? And that he essentially made this incredibly personal and I want to say emotional plea saying I am begging you. Do not go down this path. Be like me. Be free. What I wanted to do is take a moment to review the previous just like last several verses that we saw last week. And to review that, I'm going to read it. And as I do it, I'm going to say I'm going to kind of draw for you where I would draw the lines if I'm studying. Last week someone mentioned to me, hey, you never kind of explain how you indent and why you color code the way you do. My bad. I never gave you guys like a legend or anything. All right. But I'm pretty sure it's pretty self-explanatory. But here we go. You have done me no wrong. But you know, and what are the things that you know? One, that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time. And that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition, you did not despise or loathe. Instead, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ himself. Some of you guys study the Bible this way where you are reading in paragraph style and then you're kind of breaking things up. This is good to essentially like cut the scriptures into nice digestible chunks so you can study it. And what that helps you to do, it helps you to see the phrases and the words that are important. I'm going to read you guys because sometimes I actually do lean over and look at your papers to see how you guys are studying the Bible. I find that a lot of your papers look like this, which is you make the correct segments of phrases, but it's just all aligned in a certain way. With this, what I've done for you is just quickly color coded that this portion in review of the last little segment, Apostle Paul was remembering all the good that they had done to him. Very clear, right? You did me no wrong. Green is good. But then sometimes you'll see me highlight things in blue, which to me, Marks, I just need to read into that a little bit more or study it because it just raises questions. What bodily illness? What condition? Right. But this segment actually is majority green. It's him talking about how even though I have this trial and condition, that was a trial to you because it was a burden on you. And then he says, you didn't despise or loathe me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Jesus Christ himself. For me, I end up doing this kind of indentation because every phrase has a relationship to the other. And most of the time it's trying to expand, modify, et cetera, et cetera. Right. And a lot of times you start wondering, like, why does he even use the word but rather than another type of word? For example, one can say you have done me. Sorry. You have done me no wrong. Right. Such as. But that's kind of the way that it reads. Right. But what you'll notice is he's thinking wrong instead of wrong. What you've done is this. Right. And so these are the things that, you know, you know that this was a circumstance in which I came to you. I didn't come to you because I wanted something out of you. I actually came to you because I was sick. Right. And in that context, my love for you was I wanted to keep preaching the gospel to you no matter where I was, because back in Acts chapter four, when they said keep teaching us, he just kept on preaching to them. Right. And then it says this was a trial to you in my bodily condition and you did not despise or loathe, but you receive me as an angel. So instead of the despise and loathe, you notice he says, but you receive me. So if you'll notice, what I do is I highlight all the key, what they call the syntax or is showing you the relationships. And I highlight those in orange so that I can see, hey, is this an example? Is this a contrast? Is this a further reason? Is this telling me when? Is this telling me how? Is this telling me why? And all of those are really important. Right. Because I want the scripture text, even down to the pronoun to dictate for me what I'm teaching you. But more importantly, what I am receiving as a conviction. Right. Those are actually some of the ways that I make my sermons, is if I have a certain sermon about, there's a command that tells you be loving. And by the pronouns within the text, I'll actually make my points. You need to love people. This is how, this is why, this is who, etc. OK. Now, for us, by way of quick review, I wanted to just do this to show you how I do things. By way of quick review, we're in a segment where Apostle Paul is saying, look at our relationship. It was so good. Right. And so by way of overview, this paragraph that we're looking at today is a personal plea with review of the great relationship that they had. This was Apostle Paul expressing his heart's intent. You know, we can already kind of think in this paragraph, then we're thinking alongside Apostle Paul with the mind of ministry. That Apostle Paul, as he's speaking the truth, there's actually no way to detach your personal self from the people you preach to. Right. Otherwise, you just wouldn't be a good preacher. Now, I think that this segment, even in his personal plea, has three portions to it. He describes the blessed relationship in the first portion up to verse 16. Then he points to them and says, in our relationship, this relationship is turning sour because of them. And those individuals, they're manipulating you. So he points to their manipulation. And then he expresses, but this is my heart to you. Right. In my preaching, in our relationship, this has been my heart. And he expresses his intention, his desire. OK. So with that said, let's jump right into the first portion. We're looking at this blessed relationship that we have. And if you just notice by the color, the whole majority of it is just, and we had it so good. Right. You treated me well, you sacrificed for me, et cetera, et cetera. And then at the very end of it, it's like, so, but now I'm your enemy. Right. There's almost this tone of this disbelief, frustration, of ridiculousness, almost a sarcasm, like, so I'm the enemy now, you know. But let's ask the important question. If Apostle Paul is taking this length to describe the relationship, how good was it? Right. How good was the relationship and how does he describe the interaction that even between them? And I want to start highlighting it. Right. So the big thing is, he said, man, early on, you did me no wrong. OK. And in case the example that he gives, he says in my, in my sickness, rather than despising or loathing. And that idea of loathing is very interesting because it describes it as like spitting out something. Right. And back then there was so much superstition. There was so much like, oh, my gosh, don't touch me with your sickness. Right. Oh, my gosh, that person is a sinner. And that's why they're so sick. That person has an evil spirit and that's why they're sick. And so they would literally spit at them or in hopes that the evil demon would be cast out. They would do all these things. Right. So rather than doing that, they sacrificed. They bore his burden. Right. And now it doesn't even matter necessarily like what kind of sickness it was. Some people think it was malaria. Some people think it was like an eye disease because he talks about like, you would have given me your eyes, you know. But regardless of how severe or not severe it was, they clearly it was a huge burden on them, but they sacrificed for him. And what's more, this portion of it in the previous section was quite wild. Right. To what degree did they receive, to what degree did they actually tend to him? So as an angel of God and almost like, well, isn't that too much to receive him like Jesus himself? Right. You read that and it makes you almost feel like, hmm, should they have done that? You know. But what he's saying is, I'm bearing witness and I've received it. So I know and you know just how good we have this relationship. In many ways, they were loyal to him. To be willing to be so generous that he says, you would be willing to sacrifice your own eyes for me. They experienced a kind of closeness where it was like the great love of the Lord that fills your heart was overflowing to each other. They love the message and the messenger. And it was good. Right. They had such a love relationship between the two. He described it as like, and I preach to you. I gave you myself. And later on, he's going to start talking about, I gave of myself in so many different ways to you. And it was good. So, a brief note that I want to make about that is, that's a good thing. I hope and pray that our church fellowship would actually be to such a degree where we love the scripture so much, the love of God is overflowing to each other. In that, as we fellowship in the word, that kind of intimacy is experienced. It's a good thing. Unfortunately, we do kind of live in a generation and time right now where it's my kind of honest assessment that there's a lot of distrust in the generic church. There is a lot of distrust. And I can tell when sometimes I meet people, they all start asking questions like, you know, at your church, what kind of safeguards do you have? What kind of policies do you have to make sure that the church authority is not abused, etc., etc.? And that gives me a clue like, you know, have you had some bad experiences in the past? It makes you a little bit suspicious, you know? That kind of doubt and suspicion towards each other is not good. Now, I know some things have gotten sour or gone south, and that's why people feel that way. But the goal actually is to have such a deep, clear fellowship between the members of the church, right? Now, with that said, then his big transition here is to say, we had this sweet relationship, and then there is the two questions. And the two questions are, where is it now, right? First in verse 15 is, where is that sense of blessing you had? So this is the question here. And the second was, so I've become your enemy? Now, in thinking about that first question, okay, the first question about the sense of blessing, I kind of wonder, how did you take that, like, what did you think that refers to, the sense of blessing, right? What is the sense of blessing? And there were kind of few options, because you could read it in the way that Apostle Paul may be thinking, "Hey, where is that kind of blessed love that you had for me?" Right? And that's how the NIV translates it. Where is that kind of friendly, loyal, sacrificial heart that you had towards me? But then, the ESV and King James kind of describes it a different way, it's like, where is the sense of blessedness you had? I.e., if you really understand the gospel, and all that I was saying before, that you are now sons of God, where is that sense of overjoyedness, and blessedness, and happiness in Christ? You know? Well, I think, just by way of quickly mentioning, it's okay to think it's both, right? Because clearly we know, that when one is incredibly blessed in Christ, that overflows, yes? And what's more, the tragic kind of situation we're looking at, is both senses of blessedness are gone. Apostle Paul is deeply concerned, because if they go down this route of relying on the flesh, trying to seek the approval of men, there is going to be no blessedness, right? But what's more, what's happening right now, is this big relationship shift, where the enemies, the Judaizers, are trying to win over the Church, and block what Apostle Paul is doing, okay? In thinking about this, I want to quickly move to verse 16, where he says, "So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?" And the question he asks, causes us to think, oh man, did those Judaizers succeed in convincing the Church that Apostle Paul is the enemy? That he's the false prophet? That he's the one with selfish intentions to, you know, gain something? Maybe he's just this egotistical guy, who's proud and has selfish ambition, you know? Maybe that is what the Church was tempted to think, okay? But what Apostle Paul says is, man, he took that risk. He took that challenge, to rebuke a Church that he loves, to speak truth to them, knowing that there was the potential of becoming their enemy, right? And so at that juncture, I wanted to highlight something by that point of application, you know? Every single one of us, to some degree, experiences a level of fear. A level of fear of speaking truth. But what's actually interesting, is that a lot of times, that fear is intensified when we love the person we have to talk to. And one of the profound examples that I found in the Old Testament, is the prophet Eli. You guys know that very famous story that's used often to talk about, like, "Hey, listen to God, because He's speaking to you." Right? And you guys know the story of Samuel, when he was young, and he heard his name, "Samuel, Samuel." And so Samuel woke up, and he said, "Oh, Eli, did you talk to me?" And he was like, "No." Right? And it was God speaking. And what's crazy about that scene, is God was calling Samuel to speak judgment against Eli. And that judgment was incredibly, incredibly intense. Take a moment just to listen. He says, "In that day, I'll carry out against Eli all that I've spoken concerning his house, from the beginning to the end, for I have told him that I'm about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he did not rebuke them. Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by any sacrifice or any offering." That's pretty intense. Eli essentially knew that his sons were offering up false sacrifices, and he says, "Because you didn't rebuke them, you are going to be judged." And that judgment was so intense. First Samuel 2.29 says, "Why do you kick out my sacrifice and my offering, which I have commanded in my dwelling, and honor your sons above me by making yourselves fat with the choices of every offering of my people?" What an intense word. And God says to him, "Your whole lineage, there's not going to be a man in his prime, because I will cut every single one of them." That's one of the scariest things I've heard. Right? So my quick point here is, sometimes actually the people who are closest to us, where the relationship is too valuable to lose, will become the hardest moments for us to speak truth. And by way of applicational question, I want to ask you guys to discuss, in what ways can you improve upon your ability to speak truth and love, and if you've ever experienced that fear. The fear of losing a valuable relationship by speaking so. Okay, let's go to the second section. Chapter 4.17.18. Okay? 17.18. So, if you look at 17.18, it says here that they, "Eagerly seek you, but not commendably, but they wish to shut you out, so that you will seek them." So in this context, it's very apparent, that these false teachers aren't actually just trying to spread ideology. They're actually wanting to make sure, that not only do they have these people, but they have the people's heart. Right? So you guys know what I'm talking about, is they're really targeting impressionable people, and what really stinks is Apostle Paul here, has been raising them, teaching them, etc, etc, and now he's losing them to these false teachers. There's another passage that has a very similar tone, and he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, "Here, for this third time, I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you, for I do not seek what is yours, but you." Okay? "For children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children." He's talking about his heart for them. "I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?" So there is this kind of taking a personal tone, and that's why last week I asked like, are we supposed to never take everything personal? Are there moments when you end up taking it, because you've invested so much of yourself, but then you're continuing to love. Right? But in thinking about this, this is the sentiment and tone, that like a parent losing their teenage kids, to a bunch of bozos at school. When parents are raising teenage children, and all of a sudden, at some junction in their lives, friends become so much more important. Friends know more, and friends are cooler, and friends know best above parents. That's probably what this is feeling like. Okay? But we want to ask this question. As Apostle Paul is pointing at the Judaizers, what are their tactics? What is their way of trying to win the people's hearts? And I thought it was really interesting. Right? Number one, they're eagerly desiring to seek them, and to have them. Right? The term for eagerly seek, it's used in a lot of different ways, but it's like a zealous kind of fake flattery, winning them over kind of thing. Right? And then you look at what they're doing, it says, their tactic is to shut you out, make you feel like you're not part of the team, so that you'd be like, "Oh, come on, let me in." Right? And in the group, one of the guys is like, "This is a classic case of hard to get." Right? This is them trying to be like, "We're so cool, you want to be a part of us?" "Well, you can't." Right? "Look at you, uncircumcised." And then some boy is like, "Oh, I want to be circumcised too." And I was like, "I don't know. I don't know how that all played out." Right? But it's just kind of silly, and my immediate question was like, "Man, is it really that easy to manipulate people?" And my guess, we're a lot like teenagers. My guess is the guys who are Judaizers aren't like ugly, like, you know, like incapable, just bumbling fools. They're probably well-spoken, well-educated guys with clout. And all they have to do is walk around a little huddle, and a bunch of people are like, "Yeah, I wish I was part of them." Think about how easy it is sometimes to manipulate us. But then, there are just, here, it says, what they're doing is they're trying to elicit in you this need. And then you think about it again, going back, Apostle Peter, even the leaders within the Jerusalem church, yes? And so, you know, we have to definitely ask ourselves, like, are there similar manipulations and things that we are so easily gripped by? Do I have strange desires where that causes me to be susceptible to be just swayed left and right? Oh, yeah, for sure. In the academic world, you don't want to look stupid, so sometimes you just parrot things that other people say, because it sounds smart and intelligent. Are we not susceptible to that kind of stuff? I mean, in as much as I want to think that, like, I'm my own independent man, I'm a Christian, I don't care, and as Apostle Paul says in chapter 1, verse 10, am I a person seeking the approval of men? And I'm sitting here like, no, I just seek God's approval. And yet, I have crazy FOMO, I have crazy, like, what are they doing over there, right? And so I just want to ask you guys that question to also discuss, do we personally have ways in which we're very gullible and easily manipulated? We probably do, right? Okay, so that was our tactics. And then, in verse 18, he says something kind of interesting, which is, like, stated in a peculiar way. He says, it's good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you, okay? So my guess is some of you guys have to sit there and read that a few times. What does that mean, okay? So I'm not going to take too long over it, but I just want to make mention of the fact that Paul, it's funny, right, because he's seeking them. He straight up said, no, no, no, you need to be like me, 'cause I'm like you. We're Christians, we're free. We've considered everything lost so that we can be found in Christ. Be like me, and don't leave me because we had a great leadership. What happened, right? And then he's got these other people who are also pursuing them. Well, what he's saying is, no, no, no, being led by others, being discipled, right, and being desired by others is wrong. Paul is expressing humility. I'm actually seeking your good. It doesn't even have to be me. And a funny, funny example or corollary would be me speaking to you guys who are banners. I was a banned pastor just six months ago. My favorite pastime was to talk about your dating drama. Some of you guys, some of you guys now, because we haven't talked in a while, a young man comes to me and is like, "Oh, Pastor Mark, I'm sorry." I'm like, "Why?" "I didn't tell you that I did this thing "and now I'm dating." I'm like, "How can you not tell me?" No, I said, "No, no, you don't have to. "You don't owe me. "Talk to Pastor Peter Chung." He's like, "Oh, I did, that's great. "It's good for you to be led and get advice that way. "But what I'm afraid of are those bozos "who want to be cool counselors "and they're like, 'Oh, I'm so happy for you. "'She's so pretty, just do it.'" "Oh, you just only live once. "Go take your shot." Whatever it is, they just give all these crazy, crazy advice to be cool counselors. Forget them, they're bozos. That would be the sentiment of Apostle Paul here. Okay, anyway, go ahead and start over there. (audience laughing) Apostle Paul, after pointing to those Judaizers who don't actually have a good intention for you, but they want you to play their game, he now turns the picture on his heart and says, "Do you know how much I love you?" He is very personally expressing his heart's intent. And so we have to ask the question, in just this two very short verses, what are the various elements of Apostle Paul's heart and intent for this church, for the people he ministered to? What do we find? And there's a lot, right? So starting from here, he starts to talk about them as my children. And in some of our Bible studies as well, I always thought it was hilarious because I'm reading it, and I just imagine Apostle Paul being this much older grandfather, or he's talking to really young people, but he's talking to full-grown adults saying, "I love you like you're my children." And if you guys saw this term right here, in labor, that is the term for a mother who is a child giving birth, and she's bearing all the pains of bringing this baby into this world, right? He is in motherly pain over the church. That is so powerful, isn't it? Apostle Paul, in his love, he is expressing the intent of fatherly and motherly love. What's more, here he says, "Until Christ is formed in you," this is so important because this is his great goal and intention. He is going to continue to bear the pain. He is going to continue to love upon them. He could have very easily said, my guess is he's already repeated himself multiple times to this church because he talks as though he's already rebuked them, and they're not responding well. He could have just said, "Forget them, do whatever you want," right? But no, he's saying, "I will labor until Christ is formed in you." This is his goal. Not to have them be like, "Oh yeah, we're of Apostle Paul, we're of Apollos," and he just flat out says, "What are you guys talking about?" Let there be no division amongst the Christian body. Yes, I want to see Christ formed in you. You guys know that that's also, in many ways, the key to good parenting. I don't want, you know, what I find in myself, I've got to confess, I want my kids to grow up like men, and to be strong, and to be capable, and I kind of pride myself on knowing how to do a lot of things, fix your car, and do this and that, and fix your house, and if there's a problem, you're the fixer, you know? And then I realize, I'm training my children to be independent men, but what if I am training them to be independent of Christ? I would much rather have them be like me. The best for my children is not them being capable men, they have to be Christ-like men. It's good parenting, and Apostle Paul has it in view, and he's expressing his heart to the church. What's more, Apostle Paul's intent is to be present with them. This is a great pastor. This is a great smoggle bleeder. This is a great brother. This is a great sister in Christ. You sit there and people have crazy dramas, like, "Uh-uh, I don't want no drama." That's your problem, not mine. That is not a good leader. That is not a good friend, and that is not a good brother. But Apostle Paul says, "No, I want to be with you "because I'm worried about you. "I don't know what to do with you, "but I want to be there with you." Why? He says, "Man, "I want to even change my tone. "I don't want to speak like this." Apostle Paul's intent is to be with those who are constantly screaming. He doesn't say, "It's been my calling to be that guy "who just whips everybody into shape. "That's my calling." He doesn't even talk about his calling. He's being driven by the need of the church. "I don't want to talk like this, "but I have to "because you don't understand "where this road is going to. "You turning to your flesh, "you relying on your own powers "and your works and listening to these bozos, "you're going to make Christ "a better creator, right? "And so now I have to use "my firm father voice with you. "I don't want to, "but I will." Wow. What a great example of one who is doing what is necessary that he does not ruin the children. There are parents who are so afraid of their kids, afraid of hearing from their kids, "I don't love you. "I hate you," whether they're mean or bad. Right? And that's a real temptation. I don't necessarily judge it very hard because I can feel it too. Who wants to see their kid look at them with anger and spite? Nobody. And what's more, if my kid, I just imagine, if my kid's telling me, "Oh my gosh, those bullies over there. "I'm all alone. "I'm all ostracized from my Jewish friends "because da-da-da-da-da." "I can't pick these ones," and da-da-da-da-da. A parent looking at their child experiencing loneliness is painful on the parent. But here and now, Apostle Paul has to say, "No, I'm not going to give you "the earthly gift of just friends. "I want to have Christ "be formed in you." Right? Let that be a great, great example for us. We too, in ministry, just as a brother and sister, we have to have spiritual father-like hearts. We have to have spiritual mother-like hearts where we are even willing to plead and beg. Right? Because we know what it would mean if someone takes that path of a fleshly journey to have whatever it is they want on earth. You know, when we broaden out, this paragraph is summarizing this spiritual father's plea and begging. It makes me think about a long time ago, there was a young man who was very smart, very talented, handsome, articulate, intelligent, was super into reading. And he and I became really good friends. We would perform at cafe nights and stuff like that together. We would sing together. Unfortunately, in his reading, he got led astray down to this hyperversion of the gospel-centric movement and then all of a sudden, he left church saying, "This church is no good. "It's not about the gospel." Crazy thing is, shortly after, only about a year or two after, I heard news he went to the Catholic church. What? Well, part of it, in my mind now, it makes sense because I believe that gospel-centric ideology is actually just a fleshly ideology. So then when he went to the Catholic church, it was strange because he was a popular guy. People started posting on his Facebook like, "Hey, no judgment. "You gotta take that path. "Hey, everyone's on a journey. "And I just hope that in the journey, "you're real. "You be true to your real self." And somebody even said, "I'm happy for you." And I remember thinking, what in the world kind of stupid flattery is that? You're just flattering the guy. And I realized there is a temptation to do that. But if I'm actually helping him I should have been begging him. What in the world are you doing? Right? How can you say I'm about the gospel and then leave Christ? And I should be pleading. And so this is the burden. If we have people in our churches, near us, in our groups, or whatever it may be, who are considering going down this path of not caring, being nominal, and not caring about Christ, we have to do the work of ministry. Amen. I want to finish off with a powerful verse, 1 Corinthians chapter 4. "I do not write these things to shame you, "but to admonish you as my beloved children. "For if you were to have "countless tutors in Christ, "yet you would not have many fathers. "For in Christ Jesus, "I became your father through the gospel. "Therefore I exhort you, "be imitators of me." Let's pray. Lord, we are so thankful to you because you're the God of perfect patience, and you are the perfect father. And scripture would even say that you have extended your hand all day to an obstinate people. And so God, in as much as we see Paul's frustration for the church who's maybe becoming defensive, we know, Father God, many times we've done it to you. So Lord, thank you. And also we know you've placed us in this church and you've granted us brothers and sisters to plead with us, to reason with us, to give us rationale and give us scripture. I pray, Father God, that every single one of us would have a yielding heart to your word, that God, we would truly be submissive to your truth. So Lord, again, we just want to say thank you, God, for your messengers, your children. And I pray, Lord, that we, in our hearts' desire for you to edify one another, you would be pleased as the heavenly Father. It's in Christ's name we pray, amen. We'll have time for some announcements. All right, thank you, Pastor Mark. Just a couple things that are coming up. As has been announced on the Sundays, next, next Saturday, March 9th, we will be having a, like a, we do this about three times a year, just a cleaning and maintenance day. And the more people that we have helping with this, the more thoroughly we can clean our church. And so if you're thinking, like, how can I serve the church? Well, here's one opportunity just to come on one day and spend a couple hours there will be light breakfast-y refreshments provided. So please do sign up so that we can kind of assign you to a section of the church, okay? So we do need a good head count so we can also provide for the food. So please do that and take note of that morning. Also, Easter is, or the Passion Week is just about four weeks away. So we don't have that much action, much time. So we're going to be going through the Passion Week like we've done over the last several years. Monday through Wednesday, we're going to have just a devotional focusing on the events of that day followed by just maybe like a testimony. And then Thursday night, we typically have just like a reenactment of the Passover feast. So we eat what Jesus and the disciples would have eaten. We go through all of that. And so for you guys who have never participated in this and you want to participate in this, you can sign up and priority will be given to you. And this is for members only, okay? So the cost is $10 and it'll be every night, it'll be a 7.30 meeting. But for the Thursday, dinner will be at 6.30. So this is definitely something that you do want to participate in at least once, okay? So it's $10 per adult, $5 per child under 18, and if the child is under 4, it's free. So please do go ahead and sign up for this. And as I mentioned, we're going to be here every night including Sunday morning for the sunrise service followed by the Easter service at 8, 9.30 and 11.30. We're going to need a lot of help. Help with the parking, help with the cleanup, help with the setup because we're here every night. Help with just making sure that our facility stays relatively clean. So if you can sign up, please do, especially for Good Friday. Last year we had a little over 700 people here. And so we're anticipating just as much, just as many or perhaps even more. We had a little bit of a packed house, okay, with communion that night. So if you can help out in any way, please do sign up for these things. And then we have some important dates to remember. This Friday we're, the young adults are going to go up to Pine Valley, go down to Pine Valley for the retreat. And so please do keep the 217 young adults in prayer that it really would be a time of just challenge and refreshing. And next Wednesday we don't have Bible study. Repeat after me, next Wednesday. No Bible study. Which means we have an all church praise and prayer on that Friday night, okay. So it's not like, oh cool, this week we don't have Bible study so let's take time off. It's not that. We want it to focus one Friday a month where we get together in prayer and worship. So that's Friday the 1st of March. If you guys are interested in the six week Old Testament survey class, it starts on Sunday the 3rd and it'll, skipping Easter, it'll go to February 14 at 2 to 3.30 in the sanctuary. And then as I mentioned before, the Passion Week events and Easter is coming up, okay. And I'm going to post these up here. These are the questions that just serve as a guide for you to share in the discussion. And yeah, enjoy.
