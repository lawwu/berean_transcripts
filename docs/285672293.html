just approach me any way you desire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=59s">00:00:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=60s">00:01:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So they approached God in a manner that God didn't tell them.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=65s">00:01:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just something that God did not authorize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=71s">00:01:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that verse is kind of like the theme verse of the book of Leviticus because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=76s">00:01:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">whole point of book of Leviticus is teaching a sinful people how to have a relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=83s">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with the holy God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=85s">00:01:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they needed to recognize what holiness is and holiness because of God's holiness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=90s">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't just enter into God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=92s">00:01:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So book of Leviticus is kind of a microcosm of the whole totality of redemptive history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=98s">00:01:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">God is trying to teach the nation of Israel, God's trying to teach all of mankind that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=105s">00:01:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there needs to be a blood atonement that covers over the sins of mankind in order for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=110s">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span

kind of like a play playing out in human history, showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=118s">00:01:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">them that this must happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=119s">00:01:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Ultimately, obviously this is preparing for the coming of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=124s">00:02:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't have notes for you because again, if you've been here for the study of all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=130s">00:02:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Leviticus, you've gotten this review twice, so I don't have it for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=136s">00:02:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But those of you who want to have these slides, just email me and I'll forward it to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=141s">00:02:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, we're probably going to put it up on the Facebook page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=151s">00:02:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=160s">00:02:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you take the dongle out and put it back in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=167s">00:02:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=171s">00:02:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the title of the book Leviticus, it's appropriate considering that whole book of Leviticus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=177s">00:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">basically a record of God's laws, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=181s">00:03:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">About how to approach him, what kind of sacrifices, what are acceptable, what are not acceptable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=186s">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who can handle the sacrifices, where do they need to sacrifice, what do you do with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=190s">00:03:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">blood, what kind of clothes

book of regulations and how to worship God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=203s">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what that is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=205s">00:03:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">How many of you have ever studied the book of Leviticus before, other than those who've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=209s">00:03:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">been sitting

href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=214s">00:03:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Book of Leviticus is probably one of those books that you probably read a couple pages</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=229s">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't emphasize enough how important this book is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=235s">00:03:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything that we've been studying in the book of Romans is founded upon the principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=240s">00:04:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that are taught in the book of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=243s">00:04:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you understand the gospel without Leviticus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=245s">00:04:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=247s">00:04:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But Leviticus is the precursor that prepared the nation of Israel to understand why the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=256s">00:04:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel was necessary, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=258s">00:04:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've never studied it or you didn't understand it before, Leviticus is really</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=267s">00:04:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of phrases and words and concepts that you probably already know, but may have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=273s">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">attached your own understanding to it without realizing that it's not what the Bible says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=278s">00:04:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=279s">00:04:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea of inheritance, the idea of punishment, the idea of atonement, holiness, all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=285s">00:04:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things are things that a lot of times you receive from sermons or maybe movies that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=289s">00:04:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you've watched or maybe bits and

the foundation, the behind the scenes stories that set up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the

understanding our faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=308s">00:05:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The key to understanding the book of Leviticus is to do our best to decipher what it is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=314s">00:05:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">shadow of in

no one is to act as your judge in regard to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=322s">00:05:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">food or drink or in respect to festivals or new moon or the Sabbath day, things which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=327s">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">So everything that's mentioned in the book of Leviticus is a shadow, meaning the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/285672293#t=337s">00:05:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you study the shadow, it builds anticipation for the reality, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span
