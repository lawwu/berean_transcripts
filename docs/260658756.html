after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=74s">00:01:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that chapter 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, clean and unclean things,

backwards from there, and then from chapter 16, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=91s">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have 17 and on, talks about clean and unclean things, and then goes back to the priesthood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=95s">00:01:35.920</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">So we're in the second part of the outline, chapter 8, 9, and 10, no sorry, 6 to 10, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=105s">00:01:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the priesthood, so chapter 1 through 5 was talking about the sacrifices and the necessity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=111s">00:01:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of the worshippers, what they needed to do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=114s">00:01:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the requirements when they bring it, what kind of animal do you need to bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=117s">00:01:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for what sacrifices?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=119s">00:01:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 6 through 10 is about the rules and regulations given to the priesthood, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=125s">00:02:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we're looking at today in chapter 6 and 7, are the rules and regulations given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=129s">00:02:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to the priesthood, so the specific thing that we're looking at today, okay, is about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=139s">00:02:19.440</a></span> | <span

sacrifices, the five sacrifices, that there is a meal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=147s">00:02:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, obviously there's, in one of them, there isn't a meal, which we'll get to, but it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=153s">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">after the sacrifice is given, there is a kind of a celebration, so the focus in these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=158s">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">chapters are the rules and regulations to the different kinds of animals that they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=163s">00:02:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">able to eat, not to eat, and where to eat, and that kind of stuff, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=167s">00:02:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So for each of these sacrifices are accompanied by instructions on who may eat, what, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=172s">00:02:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">where, so that's the outline of chapter 6 and 7, who may eat, what, and where, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=181s">00:03:01.360</a></span> | <span

rules and regulation, it'll be like, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=189s">00:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">know, studying how to put furniture together that you don't understand, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=194s">00:03:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You have no intentions of doing, like looking at a roadmap that you're not interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=198s">00:03:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going, so it's not going to mean anything, so you always have to ask, like, why is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=202s">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=204s">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How does this connect to the New Testament?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=206s">00:03:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">How does this connect to what God is doing in the big picture?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=209s">00:03:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you don't connect the dots, or if you don't make an effort to connect the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=212s">00:03:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">dots, it's just going to sound like, don't eat this, don't touch this, don't go here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=217s">00:03:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, wear this clothing, don't wear that clothing, that's all it's going to sound like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=222s">00:03:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=223s">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And just as a reminder, when you start asking those questions and trying your best to connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=227s">00:03:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the dots, some of them are going to be very clear to you, because the language you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=232s">00:03:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">going to find in the New

href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=239s">00:03:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">languages that you've already studied in the New Testament, and you're going to see that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=244s">00:04:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, this is where it comes from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=246s">00:04:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how the Jew would have understood that phrase, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=249s">00:04:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it, you're not going to be able to connect the dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=252s">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are a little bit harder to connect the dots, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=254s">00:04:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But the effort to make the connect the dots is what makes the book of Leviticus so important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=261s">00:04:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">because they are all connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=262s">00:04:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There's nothing that's not connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=263s">00:04:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them we know, some of them we're taking educated guess, but the more you understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=269s">00:04:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible, the more you're going to be able to connect these things, and once you connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=272s">00:04:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">these things, the gospel is just going to open up, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=276s">00:04:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to get a different gospel, you're going to get the same gospel, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=279s">00:04:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">going to make so much more sense, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=282s">00:04:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is about mainly the instructions about who, what, where, and how, and then verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=286s">00:04:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">1 and 5, chapters 1 and 5, general, it's instructions to general congregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=293s">00:04:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 6 and 7 focus on the priest's role in this worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=297s">00:04:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So majority of chapter 6 and 7 are instructions for the priests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=302s">00:05:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Only chapter 7, 22, and 28 forward, it addresses the main congregation, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=309s">00:05:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, in the larger picture of the outline, we're in the priesthood, chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=314s">00:05:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">6, 7, 8, 9, and then 10, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=317s">00:05:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter 11 is when we get into interesting stuff, like what animals are clean and unclean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=322s">00:05:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably heard of before, but you had no idea why God did that, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=327s">00:05:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll jump into that when that happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=329s">00:05:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is the broad outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=333s">00:05:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So the instruction for eating the various sacrifices is given in three separate groups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=338s">00:05:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=340s">00:05:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you studied through it, chapter 6 and 7, some of you may have noticed it, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=344s">00:05:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm assuming some of you might have, and I'm assuming most of you probably did not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=349s">00:05:49.180</a></span> | <span

categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=352s">00:05:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's going to be the broad outline of how we're going to understand chapter 6 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=356s">00:05:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">7, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=358s">00:05:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the three broad outline for the text is chapter 6, 8 through 13, which is the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=363s">00:06:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">part, it talks about the burnt offering where it is wholly consumed by God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=369s">00:06:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the three outline, okay, three major outline is going to be first is only God can eat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=376s">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=377s">00:06:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the whole offering, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=379s">00:06:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we say eat, we're talking about symbolically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=382s">00:06:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's consumed by God, so the priest and the other people can't touch this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=387s">00:06:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why it's called the whole offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=388s">00:06:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The second group has three offerings, which we'll get to later, that God consumes but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=394s">00:06:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">also the priests eat, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=398s">00:06:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a second big category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=400s">00:06:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third big category, there's only one offering that falls into that category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=404s">00:06:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">where God, the priest, and the worshiper also eats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=408s">00:06:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Which offering was that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=411s">00:06:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Peace offering, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=413s">00:06:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There's only one offering where nothing is touched, nobody eats it, where one offering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=418s">00:06:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody eats it, and then there's three offering where only God and the priest eat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=423s">00:07:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=424s">00:07:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand the outline?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=426s">00:07:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That's basically outline of chapter 6 and 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=429s">00:07:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one, the whole offering, one of the main things, again, some of these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=435s">00:07:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">are overlapping from what we learned in chapter 1 and 2, but the burnt offering was to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=439s">00:07:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">burnt around the clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=443s">00:07:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It was to be replaced, so the fire was never supposed to go out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=446s">00:07:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">This is mentioned five separate times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=451s">00:07:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I only have three verses up there, it's because in two verses it's mentioned twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=456s">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So five separate times, God emphasizes the fire shall not go out, it will not go out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=461s">00:07:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be burning all the time, 24/7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=467s">00:07:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we mentioned this when we first went through the burnt offering, that there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=475s">00:07:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">an aroma at the camp constantly because there was an animal being burnt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=480s">00:08:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember, we talked about when God made the sacrifices, it wasn't enough that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=485s">00:08:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">gave the sacrifice and they were finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=487s">00:08:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He wanted them to see it, he wanted them to feel it, he wanted them to taste it, and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=492s">00:08:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted them to smell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=494s">00:08:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the senses of the worshiper was involved in the sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=499s">00:08:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't just the mind, it wasn't just the heart, it wasn't just their strength, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=502s">00:08:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=504s">00:08:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fact that this particular offering was being burned 24/7 meant that there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=511s">00:08:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a smell of barbecue in the camp all the time, and God made sure that all the twelve tribes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=518s">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were equal distance from this

have always thought there's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=524s">00:08:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">being burned, like this whole offering is being burned, whole offering is being burned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=528s">00:08:48.780</a></span> | <span

there yet, but in chapter 9 it says God sends out fire, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=540s">00:09:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">then the first fire that's lit on the altar, God lights it himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=547s">00:09:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">God

fire not going out, going 24/7, was that whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=555s">00:09:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">was being sacrificed, God, who came in the form of fire, was, he himself was consuming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=562s">00:09:22.220</a></span> | <span

God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=566s">00:09:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was, again, this is just an educated guess, but some people speculated that that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=571s">00:09:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">why they wanted this fire to never go out, because what God lit, he wanted it to be kept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=576s">00:09:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">lit, symbolizing that God himself in the form of fire was in their presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=583s">00:09:43.060</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">About this offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=595s">00:09:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a whole offering, so you

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=616s">00:10:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">grain offering, had to be given after this sacrifice, because until your sins are atoned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/260658756#t=622s">00:10:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">for, the other sacrifices you couldn't
