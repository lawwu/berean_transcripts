href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=149s">00:02:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then what's the last one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=151s">00:02:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The bowl, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=154s">00:02:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have 21 separate judgments that are...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=159s">00:02:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Every single one of them aren't judgments, but overall, the Archie theme is judgment,</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=164s">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm going to throw this question out there, and we're going to probably deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=167s">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it more not next week, but the week after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=170s">00:02:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is, if you read from chapter six through 16, you'll see that by the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=176s">00:02:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they get to the seventh seal, it kind of transitions into the first trumpet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=183s">00:03:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's kind of a chapter break between the sixth seal and the seventh seal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=188s">00:03:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then seventh seal is mentioned, and then the trumpets begin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=191s">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll notice the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=192s">00:03:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the sixth seal, there is a break, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=196s">00:03:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't immediately go into the seventh trumpet, and there's all these things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=201s">00:03:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">take place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=202s">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then by the time it gets to the seventh trumpet, it opens up the bowl, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=207s">00:03:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question that I want you to be wrestling with and just have in your mind, that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=211s">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">these seven, seven, seven judgments, are they consecutively seven, seven, seven, meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=218s">00:03:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">total of 21, or are they seven judgments on the seventh one opens up the seven trumpets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=227s">00:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then on the seventh trumpet, it opens up the seventh bowl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=231s">00:03:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So collectively, it's only seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=234s">00:03:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand the question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=236s">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just that the seventh one opens up the seventh trumpet, the seventh trumpet opens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=240s">00:04:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">up the seventh bowl, meaning the last part of the seventh year is very, very intense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=246s">00:04:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm trying to see how many of you are engaging what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=251s">00:04:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you understand my question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=254s">00:04:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want you guys to ask that question or think through that as you're reading and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=258s">00:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">studying through the next, what, 10 chapters, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=262s">00:04:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Are these seven, seven, seven, or are they meant to be seven?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=266s">00:04:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Seventh one opening up the seven, and then the seventh of that opening up the seven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=269s">00:04:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the totality seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=270s">00:04:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, I've said enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=272s">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So just kind of mull over that as we're studying it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=276s">00:04:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I may mention it, you know, may not mention it, but again, that's one of the debates that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=281s">00:04:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they have of the interpretation of this, so just keep that in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=286s">00:04:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, some preliminary things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=292s">00:04:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What we see in chapter six is not the opening of the scroll, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=297s">00:04:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So they are not necessarily a scroll judgment, they're seventh seals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=300s">00:05:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're talking about each one of these seals, as it gets broken, it unleashes the four horsemen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=307s">00:05:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then later on the other three, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=311s">00:05:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're seeing is not the scroll itself, but the breaking of the seals that would eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=316s">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lead to the scroll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=318s">00:05:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, so that's our question, is that the seventh seal, when it gets broken, the scroll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=323s">00:05:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">opens up, it doesn't, and that leads into the trumpet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=326s">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you understand what I'm saying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=328s">00:05:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last trumpet opens up the bowl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=331s">00:05:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying that that's what's taking place, I'm asking you, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=334s">00:05:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're looking at now is not the scroll, but the seals that are being broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=341s">00:05:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As each seal is removed, it triggers

that the idea of conquering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/221925963#t=1290s">00:21:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and you notice that the white
