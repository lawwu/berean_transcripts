athleticism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=152s">00:02:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">see if they like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=158s">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">three, four, five, six years old, it's just, you just send them in, you take pictures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=162s">00:02:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's cute, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=163s">00:02:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, so they don't have a tryout, they just kind of try different positions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=168s">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But as they get older, the purpose of this team changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=172s">00:02:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So somewhere around puberty, maybe around 11, 12, 13, it starts to get a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=178s">00:02:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more competitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=180s">00:03:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see the good kids being separated into different teams, and then they start to play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=185s">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">certain position, they go to the all-stars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=187s">00:03:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time they're in high school, their sole purpose is to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=192s">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're not good, you're not on the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=194s">00:03:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if you make the team, if you're not the top maybe, you know, nine, 10 players,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=198s">00:03:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not going to see much playing time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=200s">00:03:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're the guy that they use to warm up for the guys who are going to compete, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=205s">00:03:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on what the purpose of the team is, the membership of that team changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=210s">00:03:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a competitive team, for the purpose of winning, you're going to have very strict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=214s">00:03:34.440</a></span> | <span

come in, who's going to add to the goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=218s">00:03:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=219s">00:03:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now if you are talking about a neighborhood, a community, they don't have strict membership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=226s">00:03:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it's illegal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=228s">00:03:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't discriminate who comes in and who comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=230s">00:03:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, again, we live in a great country where those kind of laws exist, and so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=235s">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can't discriminate based upon age or sex

and the fact that we have even membership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=256s">00:04:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe bother you because why should we put any kind of borders?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=260s">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody should be

href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=762s">00:12:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So every church was about being discipled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=764s">00:12:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This happened at the, maybe in the mid-80s to tail end of the 80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=817s">00:13:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, you know, most churches usually have praise teams like what we see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=822s">00:13:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the end of the charismatic movement, people were saying, "Well, it's charismatic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/298336527#t=827s">00:13:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of
