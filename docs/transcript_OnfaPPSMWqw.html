Well, we just got a few extra minutes because I know you guys are setting up for your grand finale snack time. We will have a competition later on, judge right here. I'm just kidding. So excited to see everybody. As we wrap up, I want to take some time to first go into a time of worship.</p><p>So please join with me in a word of prayer. Let's pray together. Father God, we pray that as we join together in our efforts to really commit ourselves to the local body, which is the body of Christ, and also to fulfill your instructions, your design. We pray, Father God, that our hearts would be worshipful in it.</p><p>God, that in all of the efforts, in all the time and investment, that these things would be done unto you, knowing, God, that you, Father God, in your wisdom have given these words. And so we pray that our time together in fellowship would truly also be worshipful. And now, God, as we sing to you, we do pray that the combined voices of your church would be pleasing in your ear.</p><p>And we ask again that, God, in so doing, ultimately you would be honored but we would be blessed. We thank you for this time, God. It's in Christ's name. Amen. ♪  ♪ Come behold. Come behold the wondrous mystery in the dawning of the King. He the theme of heaven's praises robed in frail humanity.</p><p>In our longing, in our darkness, now the light of life has come. To Christ who condescended, took on flesh to ransom us. Come behold the wondrous mystery. He the perfect Son of Man. In His living, in His suffering, never trace nor stain of sin. He the true and better Adam, come to save the hell-bound man.</p><p>Christ the great and sure fulfillment of the law. In Him we stand. ♪  ♪ Come behold the wondrous mystery. Christ the Lord up on the tree. In the stead of ruined sinners, hangs the Lamb in victory. See the price of our redemption. See the Father's plan unfold. Bringing many sons to glory.</p><p>Grace unmeasured, love untold. Come behold the wondrous mystery. Slain by death, the God of life. But no grave could ever restrain Him. Praise the Lord, He is alive. What a foretaste of deliverance. How unwavering our hope, Christ in power resurrected. As we will be when He comes. What a foretaste of deliverance.</p><p>How unwavering our hope, Christ in power resurrected. As we will be when He comes. ♪  ♪ Worthy of every song we could ever sing. Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring. Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for You. ♪  ♪ Jesus, the name above every other name.</p><p>Jesus, the only one who could ever save. Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for You. We live for You. Holy, there is no one like You. There is none beside You. Open up my eyes in wonder. Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart.</p><p>And lead me in Your love to those around me. Worthy. Worthy of every song we could ever sing. Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring. Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for You. ♪  ♪ Jesus, the name above every other name. Jesus, the only one who could ever save.</p><p>Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for You. We live for You. Holy, there is no one like You. There is none beside You. Open up my eyes in wonder. Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart. And lead me in Your love to those around me.</p><p>♪  ♪ I will build my life. I will build my life upon Your love. It is a firm foundation. I will put my trust in You alone. And I will not be shaken. I will build my life upon Your love. It is a firm foundation. I will put my trust in You alone.</p><p>And I will not be shaken. Holy, there is no one like You. There is none beside You. Open up my eyes in wonder. Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart. And lead me in Your love to those around me. I will build my life upon Your love.</p><p>It is a firm foundation. I will put my trust in You alone. And I will not be shaken. ♪  ♪ 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus. Just to take Him at His word. Just to rest upon His promise. And to know the faith of the Lord. Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him.</p><p>How I've proved Him o'er and o'er. Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust Him. Father, You're worthy of praise and glory. You're worthy of all our songs. The prayers we lift up to You. Any adoration we give, You are worthy of. Lord, we proclaim to trust in You.</p><p>For You are worthy of trust. And though we might be imperfect in our trust, Lord, we know that the object of our trust is perfect. We thank You for Christ. In our imperfection, though we might-- we will never make it in our own works. Because of the blood of Christ, we can.</p><p>And I pray that that will be the type of worship we give to You. Just a pure worship. A passionate love for Christ for all that He has done. And may our church, by the grace of Christ, continue to grow, take in Your word, and give You the worship that You deserve.</p><p>Thank You in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. Announcement time, you guys. So, for all of you Bammers, this Saturday, the 14th, at 5.30 p.m., is the Christmas party. Don't be late. But also, please note that at 4.30 p.m., they're going to be doing set-up. If you are available, please make sure to come early at 4.30 to help out.</p><p>There is a volunteer sign-up for that. What's more, you guys know that dinner for this event is a potluck. So, please make sure you sign up to bring a food item and a plate for that, okay? So, that's the Christmas party. Now, another thing I would like to highlight is, leading up to our Christmas service, which is on December 22nd, we have several opportunities to do EV outings.</p><p>So, we've had some great times going to The Source and The Spectrum. It's going to be at 1 p.m. on the Saturday, the 14th, and the 21st, leading up to that day. So, please take advantage of that. We have plenty of those invitation cards that you can use. But on that day for Christmas service, there will be a Seekers booth after each of the services, where we'll have free resources, books and Bibles, and our outreach team members to greet your guests and then to answer any questions that they may have.</p><p>The next announcement is for our next Bible study. It is going to be on the topic of hermeneutics. We will be covering various texts of the Scripture to cover the many genres that exist in the Bible. So, please make sure you sign up for it, and please note that even some of you guys may have heard, you can stay within the same group.</p><p>If you're newer to the church, you are allowed to request, "Please, can I stay in the same group because we started a good thing," etc. But note that even if you're returning and being in the same group, you have to still sign up. So, that goes for this group and home groups as well, that you have to re-sign up whether you're repeating, etc.</p><p>The last announcement is that our ping-pong tournament and New Year's service is going to be on Tuesday, the 31st. So, if you'd like to participate in that ping-pong tournament, please sign up. This year, it's going to be doubles only. So, please mark that on your calendars for the tournament starts at 5, and spectators, etc.</p><p>are welcome, and then we'll have our main service at 11 p.m. Please go ahead and have your time of discussion, and Pastor Peter Kim will come back up around 8 p.m. for the Q&A portion. Thanks.</p></div></body></html>
