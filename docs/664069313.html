class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=22">00:00:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">my younger years, I absolutely hated my name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=24">00:00:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's one other Enoch somewhere in this church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=27">00:00:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if he feels the same way or if he's braver than I am, who knows?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=31">00:00:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I might talk to him later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=33">00:00:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would have countless nicknames like Enoch, Eggnog, and my personal favorite, Enush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=40">00:00:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Not sure where that comes from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=42">00:00:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a chubby Korean 14-year-old boy, I didn't dare correct my massive ex-NFL player of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=48">00:00:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">coach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=49">00:00:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So for three years, I was formally Enush, right, growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=53">00:00:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But at least my wrestling coach got it right, so I stuck with that sport a little longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=57">00:00:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyhoo, without digressing too much, like many other Korean Americans, I grew up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=62">00:01:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a Presbyterian church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=63">00:01:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically as a pastor's kid, as I got older, I really began to understand why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=68">00:01:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was named Enoch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=70">00:01:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">However, as I previously stated, I honestly did not like my name, nor did I really want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=74">00:01:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to live up to what it really meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=76">00:01:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So once again, growing up, I was more afraid of people mispronouncing my name at the local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=81">00:01:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Starbucks rather than understanding the strong Christian roots from which it was derived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=87">00:01:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm sure as you all know, there's a common stereotype that pastor's kids go one of two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=91">00:01:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=92">00:01:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They're either very good or terrible and rebellious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=95">00:01:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I told you that my brother was perhaps the most innocent, mission trip volunteering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=100">00:01:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">praise leader, goody two-shoes, you can easily guess where that puts me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=105">00:01:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So to be frank, I can truthfully admit that I was not a Christian growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=109">00:01:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes I would catch myself leaning towards more agnostic beliefs, especially as I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=114">00:01:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the sinful nature of the so-called Christians within the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=119">00:01:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So to really put things into perspective, I had to ask my dad, my pastor, my father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=125">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whether or not I was even baptized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=127">00:02:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So apparently within the Presbyterian church, once you're sprinkled as an infant, you eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=132">00:02:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">go through a confirmation process at the ripe age of 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=135">00:02:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have zero recollection of going through that confirmation process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=138">00:02:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So this really has to be the epitome of going through the motions to appease my parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=143">00:02:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">who of course I love very much and respect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=148">00:02:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm actually someone who unfortunately always learns the hard way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=151">00:02:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was only until the very recent year of 2019 that I went through personal hardships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=156">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond what I could have imagined, whatever happened to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=159">00:02:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've always thought of myself as tough, you know, as a tough, resilient person who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=164">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">could not really be easily broken, but I was proven very wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=168">00:02:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So lying alone in the hospital bed of the emergency room on multiple occasions really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=172">00:02:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reminded me how fragile life can be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=175">00:02:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And honestly, up until that point, I was extremely comfortable constantly giving in to my personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=179">00:02:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">vices without a second thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=182">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, this was due to the fact that I was never essentially penalized for my moral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=187">00:03:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior, which eventually became habitual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=190">00:03:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And once again, ultimately, my sense of morality and faith in God quickly diminished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=195">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So hitting rock bottom made me realize how insufficient I am on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=199">00:03:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've since accepted Christ into my life to be my Lord and Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=203">00:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I was essentially able to recover by his grace, and I was healed mentally, physically, emotionally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=209">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and spiritually by admitting my weaknesses and confessing my sins before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=214">00:03:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the primary and most important difference this time around was that I found Christ for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=218">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">myself and not solely to appease my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=222">00:03:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very grateful to have taken the chance to come out to Bahrain Community Church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=226">00:03:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">For once, I can say that I'm surrounded by a genuine community of Christ-loving individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=231">00:03:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And even after such a short time at the church, I definitely feel supported by my fellow brothers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313&t=235">00:03:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and sisters in
