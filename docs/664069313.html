in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=62s">00:01:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a Presbyterian church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=63s">00:01:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically as a pastor's kid, as I got older, I really began to understand why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=68s">00:01:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was named Enoch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=70s">00:01:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">However, as I previously stated, I honestly did not like my name, nor did I really want</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=76s">00:01:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So once again, growing up, I was more afraid of people mispronouncing my name at the local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=81s">00:01:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Starbucks rather than understanding the strong Christian roots from which it was derived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=87s">00:01:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm sure as you all know, there's a common stereotype that pastor's kids go one of two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=91s">00:01:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">ways.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=95s">00:01:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I told you that my brother was perhaps the most innocent, mission trip volunteering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=100s">00:01:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">praise leader, goody two-shoes, you can easily guess where that puts me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=105s">00:01:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So to be frank, I can truthfully admit that I was not a Christian growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=109s">00:01:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes I would catch myself leaning towards more agnostic beliefs, especially as I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=114s">00:01:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the sinful nature of the so-called Christians within the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=119s">00:01:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So to really put things into perspective, I had to ask my dad, my pastor, my father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=125s">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whether or not I was even baptized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=127s">00:02:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So apparently within the Presbyterian church, once you're sprinkled as an infant, you eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=132s">00:02:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">go through a confirmation process at the ripe age of 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=135s">00:02:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have zero recollection of going through that confirmation process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=138s">00:02:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So this really has to be the epitome of going through the motions to appease my parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=143s">00:02:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">who of course I love very much and respect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=148s">00:02:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm actually someone who unfortunately always learns the hard way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=151s">00:02:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was only until the very recent year of 2019 that I went through personal hardships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=156s">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond what I could have imagined, whatever happened to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=159s">00:02:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've always thought of myself as tough, you know, as a tough, resilient person who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=164s">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">could not really be easily broken, but I was proven very wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=168s">00:02:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So lying alone in the hospital bed of the emergency room on multiple occasions really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=172s">00:02:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reminded me how fragile life can be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=175s">00:02:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And honestly, up until that point, I was extremely comfortable constantly giving in to my personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=179s">00:02:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">vices without a second thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=182s">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, this was due to the fact that I was never essentially penalized for my moral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=187s">00:03:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior, which eventually became habitual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=190s">00:03:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And once again, ultimately, my sense of morality and faith in God quickly diminished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=195s">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So hitting rock bottom made me realize how insufficient I am on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=199s">00:03:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've since accepted Christ into my life to be my Lord and Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=203s">00:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I was essentially able to recover by his grace, and I was healed mentally, physically, emotionally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=209s">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and spiritually by admitting my weaknesses and confessing my sins before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=214s">00:03:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the primary and most important difference this time around was that I found Christ for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=218s">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">myself and not solely to appease my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=222s">00:03:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very grateful to have taken the chance to come out to Bahrain Community

short time at the church, I definitely feel supported by my fellow brothers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664069313#t=235s">00:03:55.780</a></span> | <span
