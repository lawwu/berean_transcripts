Good evening. Let's go ahead and take our seats. We'll begin in just a moment.     OK, would you all please join with me in a word of prayer as we begin our midweek Bible study? Let's pray. Our God and Heavenly Father, we want to join our hearts to thank you. God, we want to thank you, Lord, because you're continuing just to teach us and guide our path. Lord, you're instructing our minds. And not only that, but you're forming our heart, and God, also preparing us. I pray, Lord, that you would continue just to teach us what it means to be strong in a dark generation. I pray, Father God, that we would live in realities according to your word. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to fight against every deception, every false assumption that life is supposed to be so good and comfortable, but rather help us to know what it means to be strong in Christ. We also thank you, God, because many of us, we have various struggles. And Lord, God, this is such a sweet opportunity to encourage and strengthen one another. So I pray that both from the sharing and the discussion, you would help this to be a fruitful time of walking the faith together. And also, Lord, we pray that as we give our energy and time just to give you our worship and attention, we always pray, God, that you be praised and lifted on high. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.   It is good to praise. It is good to praise the Lord. It is good to gaze upon his majesty, to proclaim his love in the morning and his faithfulness at night. Oh, it is good to worship and praise the Lord. It is good. It is good to praise the Lord. It is good to gaze upon his majesty, to proclaim his love in the morning and his faithfulness at night. Oh, it is good to worship and praise the Lord. To proclaim. To proclaim his love in the morning and his faithfulness at night. Oh, it is good to worship and praise. Oh, it is good to worship and praise. Oh, it is good to worship and praise the Lord.  How great the chasm. How great the chasm that lay between us. How high the mountain I could not climb. In desperation, I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night. Then through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul. The work is finished. The end is written. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Who could imagine? Who could imagine so great a mercy? What heart could fathom such boundless grace? The God of ages stepped down from glory to bear my sin and bear my shame. The cross has spoken. I am forgiven. The King of kings calls me his own. Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah. Please, the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. You're salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope.  Then came the morning that sealed the promise. Your buried body began to breathe. Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me. Then came the morning that sealed the promise. Your buried body began to breathe. Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me. Jesus, yours is the victory. Oh, hallelujah. Please, the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. You're salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah. Please, the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. You're salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Jesus Christ, my living hope. All right. Thank you, Praise Team. So just real fast, yesterday we had an unfortunate situation of during a storm. There was a major blackout for both of our buildings. I guess there was a water intrusion in the main line from the street. And then it sent like a surge. But what happened was several things ended up short-circuiting in our systems. So request-wise, if let's say you're walking around the building and you see broken lights, if you're in the restroom and you try to turn on something and it doesn't work, please just lend a hand by letting us know. We're really thankful for all the volunteers. There's actually been working through the night yesterday. They're going to be going through various things in the week to repair. So just as a heads up, if you guys see broken stuff, that's what that is. Finally, last week I gave an encouragement to help by volunteering in whatever you can for the remainder of our Bible study series. So please go ahead and look at that volunteer schedule sheet, the 2nd Peter schedule, and volunteer for whatever you're available for. All right, you guys are dismissed to your discussion groups. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
