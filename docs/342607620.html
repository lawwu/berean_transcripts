Hanna-Barbera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=151s">00:02:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you guys may remember

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=154s">00:02:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But Hanna-Barbera came out with this video Bible series for children, cartoons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=159s">00:02:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was VHS.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=162s">00:02:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was made out of VHS and I thought it was fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=165s">00:02:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, you know, first time they made cartoon Bible pictures and all this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=172s">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it cost us $700 and I think the video series may have about 20 videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=179s">00:02:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And before I ever had kids, I purchased

href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=183s">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have to understand at that time my full time pay was under $1,000 before taxes.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=192s">00:03:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a lot, a lot of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=193s">00:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, Esther was very surprised that I spent that kind of money on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=197s">00:03:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I did that is because I wanted to be a good father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=202s">00:03:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought if I had these video series that it would make it easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=205s">00:03:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I grew up watching Andy Griffith

href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=213s">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, he was, in my view, the most ideal perfect father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=219s">00:03:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, he was a single dad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=223s">00:03:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you remember, if you know that show, basically the dad has always had the perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=228s">00:03:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=229s">00:03:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when his son would go and get into trouble, he would come down and have a wise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=233s">00:03:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation and his whole paradigm would shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=236s">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, he never loses his temper, always goes fishing with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=240s">00:04:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's really that it was about the father who was a cop, but so much of it was about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=245s">00:04:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a relationship between him and his son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=247s">00:04:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember growing up watching that thinking, that's the dad, kind of dad I would like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=251s">00:04:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=253s">00:04:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought that was a good investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=255s">00:04:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so I purchased these video series, even though it was way out of my budget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=259s">00:04:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we got married and it took us five years to have our first

know, like Jeremy's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=270s">00:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to watch this and we're going to bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=273s">00:04:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I didn't realize that it wasn't going to be until another three or four years later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=276s">00:04:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that he can actually watch it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=279s">00:04:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So from the time that I bought it until the time the kids can watch it, VHS was no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=285s">00:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">working.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=292s">00:04:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It was so cheesy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/342607620#t=301s">00:05:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I probably didn't even open two thirds of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span
