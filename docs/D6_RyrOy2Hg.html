href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1194">00:19:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I placed high value in my works and performances, in my academic grades, the positions I served in

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1212">00:20:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Growing up in a Christian household, I knew all the basic Christian beliefs and jargon, but I don't think I really understood what they meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1222">00:20:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As a young girl, I would pray that God would reveal himself in miraculous ways like he did in the Bible, so that I could know he was real and that I was one of his chosen people.</span></div><div class="c"><span

faith, and I needed to do more as a display of faith, and then I would get the proof I was looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1244">00:20:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though I outgrew many immature beliefs as I progressed from childhood to adolescence, I had already become so performance-focused that it became my identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1254">00:20:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I performed more and more, I began to feel extreme pressure from the people around me to meet certain expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1262">00:21:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It became a vicious cycle of serving and fearing man and trying to prove my own self-worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1268">00:21:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With my academics, it started with getting into Whitney High School, which was considered one of the most prestigious schools in California at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1276">00:21:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Then it was about getting better grades, getting to more advanced classes, and getting better SAT scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1282">00:21:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With my friends, it was being the better friend of the friend group, the friend that was safe to share things with, the friend that couldn't get on anyone's bad side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1291">00:21:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With my parents, it was being the reliable one out of my siblings, being the independent one, and being the one that they could place their hopes in to eventually have a prestigious career that they could be proud of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1305">00:21:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with church, it was being the perfect pastor's kid, always serving in one capacity or another, always having offering for the offering basket, even if it was just a dollar, and the list goes on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1316">00:21:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, I didn't get into the most prestigious college, and my friend group fell apart, and I was left having to choose sides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1324">00:22:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And my church wasn't what it used to be, and was whittled down just to a handful of people outside of my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1330">00:22:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So when these grand expectations were met with grand disappointment, the meaning of my life began to fall apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1338">00:22:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All the hard work I put into meeting these countless expectations, and for what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1344">00:22:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everything I did seemed to be for nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1346">00:22:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And because I tied all of my worth into my fruitless works, I fell into deep despair and feelings of hopelessness, which eventually led to me trying to take my life when I was in the 11th grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1362">00:22:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm clearly still alive, but something in me remained feeling broken and hopeless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1374">00:22:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I was too scared to try to commit suicide again, but I was still desperate for an escape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1381">00:23:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Being the good Christian girl that I was, my vision of rebellion was leaving my so-called prestigious high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1387">00:23:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I told everyone that I just wanted to experience a real high school, but in reality, it was just a way for me to try and escape some of the expectations created by my friends, my academics, my parents, and myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1399">00:23:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But my escape was short-lived as all of those old expectations just came back with new faces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1408">00:23:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And my mind constantly turned to death as being the ultimate form of peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1414">00:23:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">No more worldly problems, no more worldly expectations, just eternity with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1420">00:23:40.800</a></span> | <span

what happened this week with a brother, Charlie Kirk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1861">00:31:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And Charlie Kirk is somebody that I heard of many years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1868">00:31:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be honest, I was not a follower of Charlie Kirk because he sounded to me more like a politician than a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1878">00:31:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But after what happened, like I said, I mean, I've been so disappointed with politicians, both the Republicans and Democrats, for so many years that my natural inclination is I just don't trust politicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1890">00:31:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a committed Republican.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1893">00:31:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been a Republican since I became a Christian because it closely aligns to what I believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1899">00:31:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And absolutely today, more than any other time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1906">00:31:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was not a follower of Charlie Kirk for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1910">00:31:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Because even though I agree with him, with his policies, I saw more of a passionate politician than I saw a Christian, though I knew he was a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1921">00:32:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But after the events of this week, I did a deep dive of what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1926">00:32:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are several things that I found out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1929">00:32:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One, I was very surprised at how young he was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1934">00:32:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He was 31, and I remember seeing him even 10 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1938">00:32:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And to think, and found out that he started this organization, Turning Point, when he was 18 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1944">00:32:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was very active since high school, even as early as 16, 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1948">00:32:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's actually recordings of him when he was 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1952">00:32:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember thinking that so much of what I heard of him was many years ago, when he was in his late teens and early 20s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1965">00:32:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I kind of judged him based on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1968">00:32:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, and I, that was the first thing that I realized, just how young he was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1974">00:32:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the second thing I realized was how devoted of a Christian he is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1978">00:32:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I started to go in, listen, not just videotapes, not just clips of TikTok or, you know, certain things that people have kind of cut up to make him look a certain way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1989">00:33:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I started going and listening to all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1991">00:33:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized just how overt he was about his faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1994">00:33:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And every instance he had, he would proclaim his faith in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=1998">00:33:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He would make the gospel very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2001">00:33:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized the hatred toward him specifically is because he was being so effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2006">00:33:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He was going on campuses and hostile territories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2010">00:33:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was having thousands of students coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2012">00:33:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And because he was speaking for, for causes, and, and many people will conflate thinking that he's just a Republican.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2020">00:33:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more and more I heard him, he was actually trying to evangelize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2025">00:33:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And he will clearly say, and I think you could testify through watching all of the videos, not the bits and bits of pieces that, that the media wants to propagate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2035">00:33:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That his commitment first and foremost was to his faith in God and the gospel, and then to his family, and then to the country in that order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2045">00:34:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was pretty clear to me, the more I watched, that that was the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2048">00:34:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason why I shared all of this with you is because the question comes up is, did he get martyred?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2054">00:34:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm confident that that's the reason, right, that he got shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2060">00:34:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Not because he was against terror, or he was, you know, for tariffs, or he, he was for, you know, closing of the borders and all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2069">00:34:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I'm a Republican.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2070">00:34:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, I believe in all of that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2072">00:34:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's rational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2073">00:34:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why they hated him so much is because he was propagating Christian causes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2080">00:34:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He was speaking against transgenderism, homosexuality, these are things that we all profess to believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2086">00:34:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The only difference is, he was bold about it, and he went to places where it was hostile, and he was being very effective with the young crowd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2094">00:34:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you may have heard that there's a revival breaking out with the Gen Zs, and he has a lot to do with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2101">00:35:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because he was so effective, thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, and not, and I'm realizing more and more that this was not limited to the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2109">00:35:09.280</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2113">00:35:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen it in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2114">00:35:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen it in Ireland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2115">00:35:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen it even in Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2117">00:35:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That that's how much fruit he was bearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2120">00:35:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And because he was speaking for the cause of Christ, and because he was making the gospel, and the teachings of Jesus Christ so clear, they hated him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6_RyrOy2Hg&t=2130">00:35:30.100</a></span> | <span
