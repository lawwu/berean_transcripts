There's so many reasons to be thankful this morning, to praise his name, as we remember just his great love and loving kindness towards us, his sufficient grace, his faithfulness in our lives, the gospel of Jesus Christ for undeserving sinners like me and you.</p><p>My hope and prayer this morning as we sing and as we receive his word is that our hearts would just respond with much gratitude and with much joy. So we're gonna sing together "10,000 Reasons."

A few announcements to begin with. First of all, this coming Saturday is our church maintenance and cleaning day, and I've been asked by our logistics team that we need some more people to sign up, and so the table is outside, so if you're available this coming Saturday, the whole church, there's maintenance and cleaning going on, so please sign up, encourage you to sign up, and come out this coming Saturday.</p><p>Again, if you exit, the table that you see, all the sign-ups are gonna be taking place over there. The Thanksgiving regional dinner that's happening next Sunday at 5 p.m. Today is the last day to sign up, so if you did sign up and you didn't get any email, something may have gone wrong, so please contact Justin directly and say, "Hey, I didn't get any emails.</p><p>"Please, maybe it fell through the cracks "and you need it to be added somewhere." Please contact him, and if you haven't signed up, today is the very last day to sign up, so if you're planning to come, please go outside at the table and sign up directly there, okay?</p><p>Family ministry Christmas party that's happening on December 7th at 5 p.m. in the main sanctuary. There will be childcare that's gonna be involved, and the cost of the food is right now about $15 and then $5 for children, and again, childcare is gonna be happening here, so if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up.</p><p>So even if you're part of the home group, and because you're doing the Christmas presentation and various things, you still need to sign up for it because they need to prepare food, so just don't assume that you're signed up in your group. You're supposed to sign up individually, so if you're planning to come to that, please sign up for that outside in the courtyard, and then along with that, they are asking for more babysitters because obviously the whole family ministry is gonna be here, and they're looking for a few more volunteers to help with the seeds and the sprouts babysitting, okay?</p><p>Again, all of this is-- the sign-up table is outside, so as you're walking outside, you'll run into the table, so please sign up there. I think that's it for the announcements. Let me pray for us, and then those of you who have physical offering, again, we have an offering box in the back on the way out on the wall, okay?</p><p>Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you for this morning. Thank you for your grace and mercy. We thank you, Father God, that you've opened our eyes to be able to see who you are and what you have done. I pray that as you said, that your sheep will hear your voice and follow you.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to proclaim your glory, to make your voice clear, and that your children will be drawn to worship you in spirit and in truth. I pray that you will bless this morning, and even in the offering, may it be an act of obedience, act of service, an abundance of joy, Father God, that we would give to you what you deserve, and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Church family, would you please stand and take a moment to greet those around you before we continue our worship.</p></div></body></html>
