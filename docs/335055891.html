href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=102s">00:01:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">According to Jesus, the definition for anxiety just simply means to care for or be concerned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=108s">00:01:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about some future event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=114s">00:01:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, to care for or to be concerned about some future event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=120s">00:02:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He tells us in Matthew 6, 25, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=126s">00:02:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your

there really are two types of anxiety in the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=140s">00:02:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a

godly concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=153s">00:02:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul talks about godly concern, especially in one particular verse in 1 Corinthians 12,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=160s">00:02:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">25.</span></div><div

may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=165s">00:02:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">be no division in the body there, but that the members may have the same care for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=171s">00:02:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=172s">00:02:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that verse is really speaking to Christians and what he's saying there is that we as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=177s">00:02:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">body of believers should have care, the same care for one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=182s">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Apostle Paul was genuinely concerned, or you could say had godly concern or godly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=188s">00:03:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">anxiety, because he was eager to maintain unity in the body in Corinth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=195s">00:03:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And he wanted them to be more focused on the greater gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=198s">00:03:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you know anything about the book of Corinthians, it's, you know, a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=203s">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people that went to church there, they were really kind of more about the gifts that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=207s">00:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">had and the boasting in those gifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=209s">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But he kind of gets after him about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=212s">00:03:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, really the greater gift is Christ and you shouldn't have that self-focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=218s">00:03:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he had a genuine concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=220s">00:03:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He's expressing godly concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=223s">00:03:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants them to have godly concern for one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=229s">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so concern that is constructive is not a sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=232s">00:03:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's lots of times when you're going to have godly concern for people and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=236s">00:03:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=238s">00:03:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture recognizes certain types of intense concern as being perfectly legitimate

href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=245s">00:04:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think of some times in your life where godly concern would be appropriate?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=249s">00:04:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What about your children?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=250s">00:04:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you're concerned for them in particular ways or friends that are making particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=255s">00:04:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=256s">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes it's completely legitimate to have godly concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=262s">00:04:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But what about when you're, another thing is the way God wires us, think about times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=268s">00:04:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're kind of walking in a potentially dangerous area and you notice that your senses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=275s">00:04:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">are a little bit heightened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=277s">00:04:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a good thing because that godly concern can get you out of trouble and kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=282s">00:04:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of make you a little bit more discerning about your

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=292s">00:04:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=319s">00:05:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">first Corinthian verse, but this is in the negative

just to be distracted in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=331s">00:05:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">attention.</span></div><div

in Corinth, unlike that, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=343s">00:05:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is trying to show us, you know, that there's a type of anxiety that can be very destructive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335055891#t=350s">00:05:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and very
