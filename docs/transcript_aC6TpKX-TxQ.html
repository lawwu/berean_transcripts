Glad we're able to come together. It's always a privilege for us to gather and then tonight we're going to take time to remember the events of Passion Week and to appreciate all the steps that Christ took to ultimately go to the cross. Tonight also we're going to be able to hear a personal testimony from our sister Judy Kim. So after the beginning worship set, she'll come up to share with us. Please bow your heads now as we begin with a time of prayer. >> Lord God, we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. God, we thank you each day and we thank you for your provision. But this week and what it represents and what we're remembering, we ultimately thank you for the incredible sacrifice you have made. I pray that in order to thoroughly appreciate and understand, help us to take a long look at all of the suffering, all the events, and the steps that you took in your dedication to accomplish what we could not. And so would you bless us as we hear your word, as we fellowship, but also Lord, we long to bless you with words of praise and our adoration. We thank you God it's in Christ and we pray, amen. Let's all stand together to worship.  >> Come behold. Behold the wondrous mystery in the dawning of the king. He the theme of heaven's praise. Broke and frail humanity.

My name is Judy Kim, and I have been attending the seminary for the past one and a half years. And I'm so grateful for the opportunity to share my testimony in remembrance of Christ's death and resurrection and his everlasting provision in my life. Growing up, I was gripped with a kind of tension that things could be good now, but anything could happen tomorrow. Nothing in this world seemed permanent, and this fact always threatened the harmony of my family. When physical abuse, separated living, and financial instability threatened my parents' marriage, divorce was always this looming option. My eldest brother was kicked out of the home at 18 years old. He lived in his car while going to college and working full time as a waiter. My other brother unfortunately turned to drugs and moved away. No status was guaranteed, not wife to husband, parent to child, sibling to sibling. Hatred, discontentment, and unforgiveness had a hold on all of us, and we continued to threaten each other with these things. So this desire for self-sufficiency and fear of separation incentivized everything I did. I was aimlessly striving for some sort of control and peace, but it always quickly faded. Because I grew up going to church with my mom, sometimes when I needed God, I would run to him. However, my flesh was unwilling to fully surrender the passing pleasures that seemed to subdue the turbulence in my home and in my heart. My allegiance was wishy-washy, that is, until God made clear to me how truly ugly sin was. It wasn't that life was just hard and painful and just the way that it was for no reason, but I was a wretched sinner living in a fallen world. Despair was at its peak in high school when my mom became sick with a chronic illness called lupus that would cause her heart and kidneys to fail. Still, it has been seven years of waiting for a kidney transplant, but I see it as God's mercy that my desperation for a lasting hope was intensified by the reality that I am helpless in my own efforts and subject to his will. That even a kidney or good health was not deserved, but I have grown to understand that this does not compromise God's character, but only further proves God's holiness and sovereignty. Trying to wrap my head around God's sovereignty in my life always leaves me in awe of God's perfect faithfulness, loving kindness, and powerful authority demonstrated over and over again. God has graciously redeemed so many aspects of my family that even when I speak of the past, it often feels foreign to me when I look at my family today. It is also amazing to me how God used and still uses my mom's sickness to accomplish his purpose and that my family is held together beautifully in the palm of his hand. Though I am so grateful for God's merciful goodness in preserving my family until today, I do not put my trust in the sweetest frame. So even if my circumstances were to change, I am fully convinced that my hope and salvation can only be found in Christ, that my never-ending brokenness is a reminder of my great need for a redeemer. But in my human resolve, I felt most love for my achievements and most devastated by my failures. But in Christ, there is no system, no amount of behavior modification or effort that can restore a sinful soul to a perfect God. When I turn to scripture, I am reminded again of the sovereign nature of God and come to full faith and assurance that God's character is impeccably consistent and God is always good. So good that the Holy God did the unfathomable thing of coming to this earth in human form to pay the cost of my sin, dying the death that I deserve. As it says in scripture in 1 Peter 1, 3-4, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. "According to his great mercy, he has caused us "to be born again to a living hope "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, "to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, "and unfading, kept in heaven for you." For those who repent and believe in the gospel, this union that we have in Christ is a truth of permanence. From our God, who is abounding in grace, there is absolutely no threat of separation, no threat of divorce, no human relationship or amount of money, validation, and accolades can offer that. This body on this earth will perish. But when Christ resurrected, believers were justified before God forever. These absolute truths bring me great peace and comfort. It is a joy that I am alive in Christ and that this life is not my own, that all things are from him and through him, and it is now my fighting desire that my entire life be of worship to him and to him alone. I would like to end with a verse that encourages me a lot. Revelation 21, 3-4, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. "'He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, "'and God himself will be with them as their God.' "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, "and death shall be no more. "Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, "nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." Thank you for listening.  Thank you so much for sharing your testimony, Judy. At this time, we're going to walk through again some of the events and the storyline that took place on Monday of Passion Week. And by way of overview, we know that several things happened on the Monday, one being the cursing of the fig tree, but mainly that there was a clearing of the temple. By way of introduction, I would like to show you a map. And the reason why I'd like to show you the map is because sometimes, even as I-- every year we walk through the story, I get a little confused, like, "Wait a minute. "Where were they here, and when were they there?" But one of the important things to recognize is that Christ has come to Jerusalem on Sunday, but prior to that, he was in Bethany. And Bethany becomes, in many ways, like a home base. After each day of going into the temple, encountering both people, Pharisees, and also doing works of miracles, in the evening he returns home, okay? So on the way from Bethany to the temple, you'll notice that that is where actually-- it doesn't come off-- here you can see it on this one, that the Mount of Olives is there. And the reason why that's important is because from the Mount of Olives, first, Jesus, on the walk over, curses the tree. I'll read a passage for you from Mark 11, verse 12, and it says, "On that next day, when they had left Bethany, he became hungry. Seeing at a distance a fig tree and leaf, he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. He said to it, 'May no one ever eat fruit from you again!'" And his disciples were listening. Now, not to be confused, but what happens is, after the events that happened on Monday, they go back to Bethany, and on the next day, Tuesday, he explains to the disciples, as they wonder, because today on Monday they see it in full bloom, like leaf foliage, on the next day it's absolutely withered. Now, the conviction that comes from that story, I'm going to leave, but the conviction is very obvious. You can have something that looks like it ought to have full bloom fruit, but when you go to it, it has nothing. But likewise, from that, Jesus is going to look at the city. Jesus is going to look at the people. He's going to look at the temple where worship is happening. The temple is actually beautiful, so beautiful that when they're walking and they stop by the Mount of Olives, the disciples themselves, even though they probably grew up looking at this temple, they can't help but wonder and gaze. There are an established leadership. There are both Pharisees, chief priests, scribes, Sadducees. It's a robust system. Clearly, they have the sacrificial system. They have everything there needed to give praise, worship, and prayer to God. But what does he see when he goes into the temple? Please turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 21, and the primary text that we're going to be spending to reflect today is going to be here, Matthew 21, verses 12 and on. Thinking through what does Jesus see when he enters this temple that should to the human eye look like it's in full leaf, but bears no fruit. Take a look, and it says, "Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple and overturned the tables of money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. And he said to them, 'It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a robber's den." Pause there for a moment and meditate with me on that question. As you think about Christ walking from Bethany to the Mount of Olives, praying with the disciples, talking to them, ultimately coming to this temple, the question is what does Jesus see as he walks into this temple? And so as a very first point, I made it the longest point that I've ever written, which is this. The Lord Jesus saw a temple full of people in traditions. They were there because every year they were required to come. And each time they came, every individual was required to pay a tax. They were buying and selling. He saw merchants. He saw services. He saw goods, sacrifices. He saw officials. He saw diversity. He saw those who traveled far and wide, but he did not see prayer. He didn't see the kind of worship that God desired from his people. He didn't see spiritual fruit. With so much activity going on, what he saw was a commercialization of the temple. And what's crazy about it is one would wonder, how in the world could the temple get so bad that you have people who are selling products to each other, taking advantage of the poor? I'd like to highlight to you that they are depicted in this picture, both merchants who are selling sacrifice items. There were individuals who were selling doves. As you know, in the sacrificial system, what was normally expected was a lamb or oxen. But if you were poor, God gave you a provision and said you could offer doves. So who were these merchants scamming? Who were they leeching off of? Perhaps the poor? There were people who were maybe living in foreign lands, having to travel to Jerusalem. They had to exchange their Roman coins, their Greek coins, for Jewish money, the shekel, right, in order to pay taxes to the temple. Who were they taking advantage of, charging a fee for their services? What Jesus saw was an absolute, I guess you could say backwards commercialization of what was to take place. And this, to us then, becomes, I guess an immediate point of conviction. Is it just over time that these things happen? Is it possible that a local gathering of believers can become something like a swap meet? Is it possible that the church becomes more commercialized, that the church becomes a place of some kind of goods and services, a lot like maybe even what the world has to offer when it comes to psychiatric services, community services? Can the church become something to that degree? And the answer actually is, a sad state of affairs, if I can remind you, is that repeatedly in almost cyclical pattern, the people of God turned a gathering of what God called for as worship into something entirely different. And so many times in the Old Testament, God would say, "Put away the sacrifices. I asked for it, I don't need any more." Many times in the Old Testament, God would say, "You have incredible instruments. Is that for me?" One of the passages I'd like to highlight for you is Amos chapter 5, verse 21. It says, "I hate, I reject your festivals. I do not delight in your solemn assemblies. Even though you offer up to me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept them. And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings. Take away from me the noise of your songs. I will not even listen to the sound of your harps, but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness, like an ever-flowing stream." God's plan for his temple was that it would become a place for everyone to meet him, to pray. In other passages, like the book of Mark chapter 11, he describes it as a place for prayer for even the nations, that even the foreigner could come. Did you know that around the temple was an outer court where, yes, even the Gentiles could come and pray? It was God's sign of mercy, and at the center of his temple was the mercy seat. It's sad to say what Jesus saw was a place that was completely flipped upside down. And therefore, what Jesus desires to do in this first, I guess, day, is he reacts with anger, and he cleanses the temple. Let's read again in Matthew chapter 21, verse 12, and I highlight for you that it says, "Jesus entered the temple, and he drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves, and he said to them, 'It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you, you are making it a den of robbers.'" What I'd like to do for us is highlight those terms of what Jesus did so that we can imagine. So I want you to take a moment with me to imagine these things, that he drove out all those, right, who were buying and selling. He literally pushed people away. He overturned the money tables of people who were exchanging, you know, Roman coins to shekels. He also overturned those who were selling doves, and in another passage, you don't have to turn there, but in Mark chapter 11, the corollary passage, it describes how Jesus, he would not even permit people to carry the merchandise through the temple. So you'd have to imagine someone, for lack of better words, just going crazy. I mean, he was everywhere, right? You can imagine him running here and running there. And I would want us to imagine, even here at church, now none of the things that I'm going to mention are inherently bad, okay? Meaning, if I give the example of you couponers, let's say you post something and you find somebody who's willing to take your long-used bicycle, and you bring it to church, and you're walking it through the, you know, church parking lot, and all of a sudden, you find the most, you know, typically calm person, let's just say Pastor Nathan or something, right? Pastor Nate comes over and kicks your bicycle. Says, "Get that out of here!" And he notices Justin over here serving hard. He's taking money for the retreat. He says, "Everybody come pay for the retreat!" And then all of a sudden, he goes crazy. He's like, "What are you doing?" He flips the table, grabs Justin by the collar, and pushes him away. And then somebody's coming over here buying coffee, and he's trying to take it into the sanctuary, and he just slaps it out of your hand. "What are you doing? What are you doing?" Right? And we would think, "What are you, crazy?" You have to imagine, to everybody else, this was an annual event. To everybody else, this was their custom. To everybody else, it's become so normalized that Jesus was the crazy one. Right? Everything is so backwards. In everybody's eyes, Jesus was the one ruining, "What? These are services we're offering to people who came from far. What are you doing? These people need a sacrifice. This guy needs a dove." In their eyes, they were doing what was normative, and Jesus was the one ruining their comfortable, perhaps even the services they have within the temple. Isn't that crazy? And so what we find is that actually, Jesus, if you imagine it, I think he's scary. Right? I know we normally don't think of human Jesus in his humanity, walking on earth. He's always probably in our heads like, I call it the floating being. So calm, so collect, never emotional, just walking through. Just walks through life, no suffering, no whatever, ever phases him. But in this scene, he's literally turning over tables and pushing people. Right? He's probably scary. And the thing about it is, we know that our Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, he was so tender, so kind to anybody who was broken. Yes, even the tax collector. Anybody who was willing to listen. Anybody who was genuinely contrite. He was kind. And yet here, those individuals who had the audacity and brazenness to take the household of God, the temple of the Lord, and use it for their advantage, and propagate such an incredible perversion of the assembly, Christ exhibited incredible anger. So what does that tell us? Well, the scripture actually comments for us what that tells us about the Lord Jesus Christ in his heart. His turning over the tables and getting angry, what does that show? The first thing it shows is that Jesus, our Lord, burned with zeal for God the Father. First, in Mark chapter 11, verse 15 through 19, the scripture says that he began to teach and say to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations, but you have made it a den, a robber's den.'" Jesus knew and was convicted and had a vision for what God's intent was for the temple. God has his own design and his heart for the assembly, for the congregation, for those who are the chosen. And he said, "These are the people I call out that they would pray, that they would worship." And that vision was Christ's. And for a point of devotion and conviction for us, is that vision also a point of conviction for us? Right? For us, it is two paths. Either the church becomes a place for me or the church becomes a place where it fulfills God's vision for his glory, for his purpose. And so John chapter 2, in another instance, early on when Jesus previously cleared the temple, it told us that there were those who were selling doves and he said, "Take these things away. Stop making my Father's house a place of business." And his disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume me." And when that kind of vision consumes us, it's going to grant to us boldness, it's going to grant to us courage to make us risk takers, it's going to grant to us a willingness to say, "You know what? This discomfort, this unsettling thing, this thing that's a little bit worrisome, doesn't really even matter, does it?" Why? Because that's not what I was trying to do anyway. That wasn't my goal. That wasn't my picture. And this is what I'm saying. In Psalm 69, verse 7 through 9. Psalm 69, verse 7 through 9. This is the passage that the disciples remembered about Jesus when it said that his zeal was consuming him for the house of the Lord. But it says here, "Because of your sake, I have borne reproach, dishonor has covered my face. I have become estranged from my brothers and an alien to my mother's son. For zeal for your house has consumed me and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me." Doesn't that say a lot? This is King David writing that because the pagans, because the lost are godless, the hatred that is directed at God, he is willing to bear as risk to himself. That's what kind of power we would have if we had a zeal for the Lord. How can a church go from being like the center of worship to a commercialized place of goods and services is because whenever God's not considered, it creates a vacuum. It creates a vacuum of purpose and intent where we make it whatever we want. And so the first thing again that what Jesus was doing, it shows his heart and his zeal for his father. Two, it shows Jesus' authority as a son of God. Jesus' authority as a son of God. I won't say a whole lot on this, but because in John 2, verse 18, the passage I was reading to you earlier, in that passage the Jews respond to him and they're upset. They're as upset as can be. And obviously their first question is, "Who in the world are you?" He says, what they say to him, "What sign do you show us "as your authority for doing these things?" Because Jesus is acting with so much anger, so much force, the first question is, "Who in the world are you? "What authority do you have?" But clearly what they miss is that from the moment Jesus is arriving on scene, on Sunday when Jesus entered in, the crowds and masses were screaming, "Hosanna, Hosanna to the son of David." If they said that, they should have known. This is the Messiah. The son of David is a very unique loaded term pointing to the promised one who would come as king. And the passages they were quoting when they were praising him were all quoting things like Zephaniah 9, which is, "Here comes your king." They should have recognized his authority. They should have recognized that he was performing miracles, having power over nature, wind, water, disease, demons, people. They should have seen him for who he is. But the next point I want to show is that this instance of Jesus cleansing the temple shows also that Jesus' mission when he arrived on earth was truly to serve and not to be served. I just want to take a moment to highlight that back in Matthew 21, verse 14, it says in a strange, almost weird transition that Jesus overturned everything. He pushed people out. He drove out the people who were selling doves. And then he started to teach, saying, "The Lord's house will be a house of prayer." And then a bunch of people started coming to him for healing, and Jesus ministered to them. He came healing their sicknesses. He came ministering to them. And what that sets up is this strange and incredibly interesting scenario where, again, you have those individuals who recognize their need desperately coming to Christ, but everybody else feeling incredibly threatened. And so I want to conclude with this. What Jesus does on Monday, it causes incredible tension. I mean, think about something like provoking. When he entered into the scene on Palm Sunday, in some sense, the people were just watching. And the Pharisees, the opposition, were thinking, "Okay, there's a lot of people worshiping. "He's gating greater popularity." But here and now, he is completely going directly at them. The high priests of the temple were gaining much from that kind of, you know, flea market scene. And his actions were bold, controversial. And in those rulers' eyes, Jesus' actions was absolutely rebellious. You would almost think that, in their eyes, Jesus' actions were on tier of like terrorist stuff, right? Revolting stuff. And what's interesting is, if you look down at Matthew 21, verse 15, it says, "When the chief priests and the scribes "saw the wonderful things that he had done, "and they saw the children who were shouting in the temple, "'Hosanna to the Son of David,' "they became indignant, and they said to him, "'Do you hear what these children are saying?' "And Jesus said to them, 'Yes, have you never read, "'out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies, "'you have prepared praise for yourself?' "And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany "and spent the night there." So there you conclude this strange, strange scene. One of incredible anger in Christ to overturn all that perversion that's taking place in the temple. People who are still in need coming to Christ for healing. And Jesus ministering to them. But nevertheless, the tension then, is rising with the leaders. The Pharisees and the scribes. In Mark chapter 11, 18, it describes that the chief priests and the scribes heard this, and they began seeking how to destroy him, for they were afraid of him. For the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching. When evening came, they would go out of the city. I want to conclude by saying, what we see here then, is that for this week, this is where, I mean, Pastor Peter on this past Sunday's sermon, described how incrementally, the rejection of Christ was mounting and growing into higher levels. And as we come to this last week of his life, the Passion Week, the rejection of Christ is hitting a pinnacle point. But here and now, it's ramping up so fast. From this moment, the Pharisees and scribes were looking for an opportunity to destroy Christ. As a point of conviction for us, I've said this multiple times, and I reflect on this truth. Not only are we in danger of allowing the assembly that God has designed to eventually cater to the desires and wants of man, but if we ever allow ourselves to do that, at some point, if we're not for Christ, we're going to need Him to get out of the way. Let me repeat that. If our hearts are not in desperate need, just like the people who are sick, and we see our desperate need to go to Him and say, "Christ, You're the one who can heal me. You're the one who has forgiveness and grace for me." If we're not going like that, but instead, we've allowed the things of God, the assemblies of God, the ministry of God, the provisions of God, to cater to us, at a certain point, Christ Himself will become the stumbling block. It's the way that God has already predicted it. He's established the true cornerstone, and anyone who will not bow the knee will stumble upon that very stone. Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father, we thank You, God, for Your Word that has encapsulated for us the various perspectives and the things that were taking place. As we read it, it does bring to us deep, deep conviction. How could the entire system go so, so sour? How could things be so bad that everything from top to bottom, from the leadership down, be against You? How could the Messiah come with works of miracles? He's performing miracles in the midst, and yet people reject? Lord, we pray that You would really teach us humility, knowing God that without the Spirit, without Your Word, the light of truth, and without our Savior, we can go so wrong. With that conviction, we thank You. We thank You for Christ, desiring to cleanse, make holy, and sanctify. We thank You, Lord, for Your merciful eyes, that look upon sinfulness, and though You could have judged then and there, though You could have truly put an end to all the ridiculous things that take place underneath Your name, God, You show grace and mercy. So for all of this, we thank You. And Lord, together, as we're gathered tonight, we lift up also to You a prayer. Would You guard our hearts from any kind of selfish ambition that expects things from Your congregation, from Your ministry, but yet we haven't surrendered our hearts? Help us never to lift up to You worship like that, but God, to render to You everything from our minds, our emotions, our souls. We thank You, Lord, it's in Christ's name. Amen.                                        Amen, let's pray. God, we do truly thank You for the sanctifying work that You do in our lives. Thank You for truth that washes and renews our minds. Thank You, Father God, for the ministry of the Spirit. And through that, God, we truly do want to lift up to You worship that You deserve because You're holy. And God, we don't want to give to You tainted worship where we're just busy doing our own thing, taking care of our own business, and not giving attention to You. We also want to pray that You help us that we do not offer up to You worship on Sundays, but send the others. Help us, Father God, to lift up holy hands. And Lord, help us, God, that we would not lift up to You the scraps of our time, whatever only we could afford here and there, but rather that it would be the forefront priority of our lives. God, that when we're gathered together, we're truly giving to You our heart's best. And in that way, God, we want to lift You up. In that way, God, we want to truly regard You as the greatest treasure in our lives. We thank You again. It's in Christ's name. Amen. You may all have a seat. And as you do, just as a couple of brief announcements, number one, the Cafe Ministry team, we're really thankful for them. They're going to be opening their doors each evening at 5.30 p.m. on devotion nights. So you can come early, and in that way, you're never late to the devotion time. Also, as you guys know, the parking-wise, it is a little bit different in that this back one here and the far one, which is the Fitch building, that those two are closed, but everything else is open here and then the normal sites. On the Facebook, we put a map, and we'll just send it out again. And so just please make sure you kind of pay attention to that. So tonight, that's it for the evening. You guys are free to go, and then we're going to close the place up around 9.30 at the latest so that we can go to our work and businesses and come back the next day refreshed. Thanks again, everyone.</p></div></body></html>
