href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=17">00:00:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today I have the privilege of sharing my testimony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=20">00:00:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was actually raised up in the church by my parents and growing up, I never really</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=29">00:00:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It was something that felt like more of my parents' faith and not mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=34">00:00:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as I grew up, I actually slowly started to despise it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=38">00:00:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I got older, I started having thoughts like, why do I have to follow all these rules</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=47">00:00:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that don't apply to most people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=50">00:00:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I got, sometimes I even felt like I was an outsider at school, but I just chose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=56">00:00:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to ignore this feeling because I just tried to fit in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=60">00:01:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually, because I was raised up in the church, it's always made me recognize how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=66">00:01:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a God, yet I chose to just ignore him because I didn't want to feel guilty about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=71">00:01:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">any of my

just going to be making the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=77">00:01:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">same mistakes or sinning again in the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=85">00:01:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes I even twisted what God meant to me so that I can use him to serve myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=90">00:01:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of serving him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=95">00:01:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And for a majority of my life, I've continued to think this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=99">00:01:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But recently this summer, God actually made me realize just how sinful this world is and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=105">00:01:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">also how I am just so much like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=109">00:01:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">All I cared about was myself and what made me happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=113">00:01:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So last semester when I was dorming at Cal State Long Beach, I wasn't attending any churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=119">00:01:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because quite honestly, I didn't feel like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=123">00:02:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I wondered what it was like having an entire day of the weekend all to myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=128">00:02:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, as you can see, my selfishness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=132">00:02:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But thinking about it now, I realized that God was working in my life to bring me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=136">00:02:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Berean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=137">00:02:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Berean caught my eye with the realization of just how much there was to learn about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=142">00:02:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">God and honestly, also just how welcoming everyone was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=147">00:02:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">At first, this welcoming of the large ministry that I'm not used to was what kept me attracted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=154">00:02:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to Berean and I kept coming because of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=157">00:02:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I kept coming, I learned more about God and his word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=162">00:02:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, I also just realized how short my understanding was in Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=169">00:02:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Before all of this, I actually thought that I was already saved because I knew that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=175">00:02:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">died for me on the cross as a mere fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=178">00:02:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I didn't know was like, I didn't live my life as if he was actually my Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=185">00:03:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so God made me realize just how great my sins were against them and how Jesus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=190">00:03:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">actually the only one who's able to save me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=193">00:03:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So just as it is written in Ephesians 2.8, "For by grace you have been saved through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=198">00:03:18.980</a></span> | <span

God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=203">00:03:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He's shown me grace by giving me a new heart and making me alive so that I can now follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=209">00:03:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and love him by faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=211">00:03:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">He's made me recognize what he's done for me and just how grateful I should be because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=215">00:03:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=218">00:03:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's all about living a life that's glorifying to the Lord and having my own relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=223">00:03:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=231">00:03:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But because he opened my heart or opened my eyes and gave me a new heart, I now no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/527982089&t=237">00:03:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">desire to follow the world, but I follow Jesus as my Lord
