class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=0s">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even read that as you guys know, we've been covering our fourfold vision about two, three weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=6s">00:00:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We started out with the first vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=7s">00:00:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if you look at the bottom of your program on the front side, well, we have a fourfold vision of our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=14s">00:00:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is something that we try to evaluate and make sure that these are things that we shoot for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=20s">00:00:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So any areas that we feel like we need to emphasize that that year, we try to target that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=26s">00:00:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is something that it's important for us as a church, as our church is growing and more and more new people are coming to the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=34s">00:00:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's important for us that, you know, a lot of you guys who may have come from other churches and think, OK, this is what we did and this is how I grew up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=42s">00:00:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the way this church ought to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=44s">00:00:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's important for us that we recognize that there are certain things that we value in the church, not because it's unique to Berean, but because we see this in scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=52s">00:00:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a couple of weeks ago, we talked about why high view of God and worship is at the center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=58s">00:00:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So all these other visions really stem from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=61s">00:01:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the church is not worshiping God in spirit and in truth, then teaching of the word of God, fellowship, everything that we're doing is really for for nothing, because what God desires more than anything else is to seek people who worship him in spirit and in truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=76s">00:01:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's God centered worship and not man centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=79s">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So our church does not function by surveying and say, well, what's going to cause the church to grow the most?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=85s">00:01:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What is going to attract the most people to church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=88s">00:01:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We've never functioned with that mentality because we don't see Jesus's ministry done that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=92s">00:01:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Our primary desire is to see who God is and how should he be worshipped?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=97s">00:01:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How how should the church look like based upon what we know of him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=102s">00:01:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why the the first vision of our church is to have a God centered worship and not man centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=109s">00:01:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The second vision is what we're going to be talking about today is to equip the church, equip the believers with God's inerrant word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=116s">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we're going to be touching upon today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=118s">00:01:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then again, we're going to go through all four of them before I jump into another another letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=123s">00:02:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's read IACS Chapter 17, verses 10 and 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=126s">00:02:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The brothers immediately send Paul and Silas away by night to Berea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=132s">00:02:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=134s">00:02:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=137s">00:02:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They received the word with eagerness, examining scripture daily to see if these things were so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=143s">00:02:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=151s">00:02:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We thank you for your goodness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=154s">00:02:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We thank you for your patience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=156s">00:02:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We thank you for the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=159s">00:02:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That indwells us, Lord God, constantly interceding on our behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=162s">00:02:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We thank you for Jesus, our high priest, our mediator, who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, that we may enter the throne of grace with confidence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=172s">00:02:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As we have come before you, we ask, Lord God, that you would open the gates, help us, Lord God, to be in your presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=182s">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That everything that is taught, everything that we hear, may be the voice of Christ, that your children may hear his voice and follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=191s">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So help us, Lord God, in Jesus name we pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=194s">00:03:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=194s">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I read this text in IACS Chapter 17, not because next week I'm going to be expositing this text, but I want you to first and foremost understand where this where we got our church name, Berean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=206s">00:03:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, at the beginning, when we changed our church name to Berean Community Church, the typical response that I got from people was, does your church also speak English?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=216s">00:03:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's that's the first response I get, because they thought I said Korean Community Church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=221s">00:03:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And because the term Berean is not is not something that's common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=227s">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it's only mentioned here and it's only mentioned kind of a blip as it's passing by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=233s">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, the story is Paul is in his missionary journey and he comes to this this city in Thessalonica and it becomes a very prominent church in the early church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=244s">00:04:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if you read the epistle of First Thessalonians, Paul says this becomes a model church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=249s">00:04:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They learned to practice love with one another and and their faith was being proclaimed all throughout Macedonia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=256s">00:04:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">People were talking about this church and Paul was only there for a very short period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=260s">00:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So Thessalonica became a model church that all the other churches ought to have followed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=266s">00:04:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at this text, Paul gets driven out of Thessalonica because of persecution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=271s">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And Berea wasn't probably wasn't even on his radar, because if you look at Apostle Paul's ministry plan, he targets all the major cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=279s">00:04:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Berea, he only reason why he came here is because he was being persecuted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=283s">00:04:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He got chased out and he landed here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=285s">00:04:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And well, since I'm here, I better preach the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=288s">00:04:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he preaches the gospel. But he calls these people, these Bereans, of more noble character than this model church, Thessalonica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=297s">00:04:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why it says they received a word with all they can examine the scripture to see if these things were true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=304s">00:05:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, Paul actually said these guys are more noble because they questioned me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=310s">00:05:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't just receive it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=312s">00:05:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, you know, I'm preaching the word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=314s">00:05:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It must be true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=315s">00:05:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, he says, no, they're more noble because they questioned him, because they tested him to see if it was scripturally correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=322s">00:05:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So early on in the church, we we call ourselves Berean Community Church because we wanted to be a church that is based upon the word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=331s">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not because we're Baptist, not because we're Presbyterian, not because we come from a certain background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=336s">00:05:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But is it biblical?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it scriptural?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=340s">00:05:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I was raised in a Presbyterian home for the most part is very conservative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=347s">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And and and then I got saved in a charismatic parachurch ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=352s">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So early on as a Christian, I basically rejected everything that I knew, everything that I was taught because it was Presbyterian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=360s">00:06:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, at that time, I didn't understand because here's a group of people to me was living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=365s">00:06:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, their worship was lively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=367s">00:06:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Their prayer meeting was you know, they cried out to God every Friday night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=371s">00:06:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I don't know about you, but have you ever argued with somebody that you were absolutely convinced that you were right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=378s">00:06:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then later on found out you were absolutely wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=381s">00:06:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Has that ever happened to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=383s">00:06:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, if you say no, you're liars or you're so proud that you don't recognize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=389s">00:06:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=811s">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was a lot of seminars and conferences taking place to to combat all the chaos that was being created by the charismatic movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=820s">00:13:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there was a student

we were practicing church was was not charismatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126048268#t=840s">00:14:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So he just
