of him because he wrote that about himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917&t=178">00:02:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, "Oh, he

href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917&t=236">00:03:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So when he says he was the humblest in the world, that wasn't a humble brag, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917&t=241">00:04:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they call it a bragamony, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

something going on in the Greek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917&t=857">00:14:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that couldn't be translated exactly
