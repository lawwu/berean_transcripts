interesting things is that Moses is credited to be the author of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=161s">00:02:41.520</a></span> | <span

within that law, Moses describes himself in Numbers 12, 3 as being the humblest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=172s">00:02:52.040</a></span> |

fun of him because he wrote that about himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=178s">00:02:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, "Oh, he couldn't help it because God dictated that, and so he was just writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he didn't really mean it, but God told him to write it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=185s">00:03:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of people don't know what to do with that, that it was kind of a humble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=189s">00:03:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">brag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=190s">00:03:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, "I'm the humblest in the world."</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=196s">00:03:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I really think that he meant what he said, but the way that we take it is humble, kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=201s">00:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of like, "Oh, you know, I'm no good at anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=206s">00:03:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that's what he's talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=208s">00:03:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he really was humbled because he's described as an individual who met God.</span></div><div

he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=222s">00:03:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">got humbled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=226s">00:03:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was no other human being that was given that kind of vision, that kind of direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=231s">00:03:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">access to God that Moses did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=236s">00:03:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So when he says he was the humblest in the world, that wasn't a humble brag, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=241s">00:04:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they call it a bragamony, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=243s">00:04:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a testimony, but you're really bragging about yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=245s">00:04:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "No, I think he was actually humbled."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=249s">00:04:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what he means by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=251s">00:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That in the presence of God's glory, he realized who he was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/515062917#t=257s">00:04:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's naturally what happens when people are confronted or in the presence of a God</span></div><div
