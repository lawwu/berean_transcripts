Scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=121s">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">together, discussing together our reflections, and just our reflections of application as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=126s">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=259s">00:04:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So please stay online and check your emails as often as you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=293s">00:04:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at it, the first stage, and again, let me tell you where this is from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=298s">00:04:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">This is from a missionary doctor who was actually very intimately involved with the SARS outbreak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=305s">00:05:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And he

with the information and the spread of SARS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=313s">00:05:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">but which was at that time, which was a lot more deadly than what's going on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397835647#t=316s">00:05:16.260</a></span> | <span
