two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=105s">00:01:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">main parts, but the three parts, if you wanted to break it down and be technical, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=109s">00:01:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">part is about the lamp and about how keeping that burning, and the second part is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=114s">00:01:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the bread and the 12 cakes that were commanded to make, and then the third part is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=120s">00:02:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the punishment for blaspheming the name of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=123s">00:02:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And all three of it, it conveys or teaches to the nation of Israel the seriousness of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=128s">00:02:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the command of holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=131s">00:02:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of these things are ultimately the same thing that's been taught all throughout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=134s">00:02:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Leviticus is to teach that God's holy presence requires that people need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=141s">00:02:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">be holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=142s">00:02:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's a running theme in everything that he does, whether it's the sacrifice of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=145s">00:02:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">animals or sacredness of the priesthood, even the garment that they wear, every part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=150s">00:02:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it points to the fact that a holy God cannot simply dwell

of it talks about lighting of the lamp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=165s">00:02:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let me get into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=168s">00:02:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to jump through it real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=173s">00:02:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a really bad picture on the computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=177s">00:02:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Looked pretty good, but okay, so I don't know if you can, you see this light?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=183s">00:03:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=184s">00:03:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the obvious lamp stand, and this is the veil of the curtain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=191s">00:03:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of opened up so that you can see what's inside, but obviously normally this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=195s">00:03:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">whole thing would be covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=197s">00:03:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the table where the bread is held.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=202s">00:03:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that they're talking about is talking about in this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=205s">00:03:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is called, what room do you call this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=209s">00:03:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy of Holies, and the outer one is just called Holy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=212s">00:03:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the Holy Chamber, and this is the Holy of Holies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=216s">00:03:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the priests, they can only go as far as this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=221s">00:03:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is as close to you are able to get before you get to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=226s">00:03:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy of Holies, again, obviously all of this is in some sense symbolic, but only the high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=231s">00:03:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">priest is able to enter here on the Day of Atonement once a year, and even that, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=235s">00:03:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have to kind of hurry up and do your duty and come out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=238s">00:03:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So normally, only the priests can enter into this area, and again, on a regular basis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=247s">00:04:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is as far as God allowed them to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=249s">00:04:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what is happening today in chapter 24 is about what is supposed to be lit and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=257s">00:04:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">made into this room, so that every time they've entered into this room, these light and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=263s">00:04:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">bread was to symbolize something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=265s">00:04:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the primary thing that these two things, the light and the bread or the cake symbolize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=271s">00:04:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">was the presence of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=272s">00:04:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to jump into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=277s">00:04:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The lamps were to be kept burning through the night, and again, verses 1 through 4,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=282s">00:04:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and the word continually used four times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=285s">00:04:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice that over and over again, it says continually, repeatedly, day and night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=290s">00:04:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=291s">00:04:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It is to be lit morning and night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=294s">00:04:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It is to be a perpetual statute throughout the generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=298s">00:04:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice, if you study through 24, you'll notice that that language, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=302s">00:05:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the first part of it, verse 1 through 9, he repeats, do this, repeat it over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=306s">00:05:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">again, continuously, continuously, morning till night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=310s">00:05:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It is an everlasting statute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=313s">00:05:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've read it, you probably already picked up on that, that the intent of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=317s">00:05:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is to teach the nation of Israel of an ongoing presence of God in the nation of Israel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=325s">00:05:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the light represented the Lord's presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=331s">00:05:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this was, the Lord's presence among the nation of Israel wasn't, he just showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=336s">00:05:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">up to perform a miracle and disappeared, or he spoke to them and disappeared, but all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=340s">00:05:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of this pointed to the fact that God's presence was with the nation of Israel nonstop, continuously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=346s">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">over and over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=348s">00:05:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So every time a priest would enter into the holies, he would be reminded, oh, the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=353s">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=357s">00:05:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We see that in the Old Testament, Israel is often portrayed as the light of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/294618676#t=363s">00:06:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We see that Jesus says that he is the light of the world in John 8,
