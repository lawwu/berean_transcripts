class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=117s">00:01:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a while now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=118s">00:01:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I probably, if there's any one book that I've really dedicated myself to get to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=123s">00:02:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and familiar with, it's probably this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span

know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=150s">00:02:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">typically when we think about the meat of the gospel or meat of the book of Romans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=155s">00:02:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we usually think of chapter eight, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=158s">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter eight of the book of Romans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=159s">00:02:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Or chapter one through eight is the presentation of the gospel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=163s">00:02:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The first three chapters is about how all have sinned and fall short of the glory of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=167s">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">God and it introduces us for need for Christ and what does it mean to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=172s">00:02:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter eight, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=176s">00:02:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that takes us to chapter nine through 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=180s">00:03:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically, even some of the commentaries, if you read the commentaries, it'll say chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=184s">00:03:04.260</a></span> | <span

chapters where he's been making an argument, he's made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=190s">00:03:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">his point in chapter eight and that's kind of like the pinnacle of what Paul was trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=194s">00:03:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=195s">00:03:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then before he moves on to the imperatives in chapter 12, so therefore this is how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=199s">00:03:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ought to live, he takes three chapters to explain why God is not done with Israel, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=204s">00:03:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in essence, that's what he does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=206s">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He does take three chapters to explain to us where does Israel fit into all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=211s">00:03:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If God has opened the door to the kingdom of God to the Gentiles and all this time that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=216s">00:03:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the Jews believed that they were the kingdom, right, and then what does this mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=221s">00:03:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this time going through it, I realized that chapter nine through 11 isn't parenthetical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=226s">00:03:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=227s">00:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It fits right in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=229s">00:03:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It fits right in with Paul's argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=231s">00:03:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I realized with that chapter one through eight was the presentation of the gospel and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=236s">00:03:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to chapter nine through 11 is an illustration of that gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=241s">00:04:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the actual outworking of that gospel in the nation of Israel, what God has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=246s">00:04:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doing through the Old Testament, New Testament, and what God will continue to do going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=252s">00:04:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in actuality, he's not taking a break from his argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=256s">00:04:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In reality, what he's doing is he's given the argument, full scope of the argument up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=261s">00:04:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to chapter eight, and then he actually illustrates it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=264s">00:04:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how it played out with the nation of Israel, and that serves as an example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=269s">00:04:29.240</a></span> | <span

last verse, verse 36 next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=339s">00:05:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically what he's doing, he's summarizing the message of the cross in these verses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=344s">00:05:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's going to be a huge transition that's going to take place from chapter 11 to chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=348s">00:05:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=349s">00:05:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 12, he's going to start going into the imperatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=352s">00:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's given us the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=356s">00:05:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how the gospel has been playing out in the history of Israel and how it will play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=359s">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">out with the Gentile

this is what it means to you in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=368s">00:06:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your personal life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=369s">00:06:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not Paul's whole intention wasn't just, "Well, I hope you understand what the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=373s">00:06:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=374s">00:06:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, "Well, okay, now we're better educated on who God is and what he has done."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=377s">00:06:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a point to all of this, at least practically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=380s">00:06:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is because of what he has done, because of who he is, "Therefore, live out your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=385s">00:06:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and offer your body as a living sacrifice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=388s">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's going to be the main argument he's going to be making and challenge he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=393s">00:06:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">going to give us starting from chapter 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=395s">00:06:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But before he does that, he concludes and wraps up his 11 chapters of presentation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=400s">00:06:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=402s">00:06:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, what he has to say in these passages are rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=406s">00:06:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope if some of you guys had took some time to read it or at least wrestle through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=411s">00:06:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it, you'll hopefully get more out of it than if you didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=414s">00:06:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But either way, we're going to be looking at the three arguments that he's making here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=421s">00:07:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and basically in summary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=422s">00:07:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could probably spend the whole month or even more just talking about each one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=427s">00:07:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=428s">00:07:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, as Paul has already made these arguments and now he's giving it to us as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=432s">00:07:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a summary before he moves on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=434s">00:07:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So this morning, I want to look at three things that he gives, three qualities of the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=438s">00:07:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that he gives, again, as a summary of what he's been saying up to this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=442s">00:07:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So the number one, the first thing that he says, we find in verse 32 where he says, "For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=448s">00:07:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=454s">00:07:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He's made the argument up to this point that the Jews, because of their disobedience, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=460s">00:07:40.040</a></span> | <span

result of their hardening, God allowed the Gentiles to come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=467s">00:07:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he reminds the Gentiles that at one point you were hardened and God had mercy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=473s">00:07:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on you and he brought you to faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=475s">00:07:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the end, God has consigned everyone, Jew and Gentile, to disobedience that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=483s">00:08:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">may have mercy on all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=484s">00:08:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first point that we want to see in this is the gospel is made manifest through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=489s">00:08:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the disobedience of mankind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=493s">00:08:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The first summary, the gospel is made manifest through the disobedience of mankind.</span></div><div

should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=506s">00:08:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have, okay, so if you're sitting here right now with absolutely blank, kind of like, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=511s">00:08:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, that's, you know, he

you should be asking, if God consigned people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=520s">00:08:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to disobedience, how can he keep, how can he bring judgment upon mankind if God's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=527s">00:08:47.080</a></span> | <span

consigned them to disobedience, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=534s">00:08:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If he led them to disobedience, if he pushed them toward unfaithfulness, how can he come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=541s">00:09:01.760</a></span> | <span

you should be asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=545s">00:09:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not asking that, you probably

understand what he means by that, we need to really dissect what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=553s">00:09:13.680</a></span> | <span

the word disobedience in and of itself in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=561s">00:09:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Greek is

href="https://www.vimeo.com/239744011#t=576s">00:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It means unwilling to be dissuaded, persuaded, meaning you have no feelings toward it, that</span></div><div
