some time to look at the text, chapter 17 and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=116s">00:01:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">even 18 before you came, but chapter 17 and 18 is probably one of the more difficult passages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=123s">00:02:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to interpret.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=125s">00:02:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And not that the other parts have been easy, but if you've taken any time to look at it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=130s">00:02:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know about the seven horns and then the ten, you know, seven kings, seven hills, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=135s">00:02:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ten horns and then you have the beast and then you have the riding of the beast and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=139s">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then you have the waters and you have all this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=141s">00:02:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it requires a little bit more time to dig into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=147s">00:02:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, everything that we studied up to this point, remember we talked about there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=150s">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">four different ways to approach the interpretation of book of

a completely different application,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=159s">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">completely different understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=161s">00:02:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I already kind of shared with you, you know, our approach to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, so there are some things that we want to take some time to look and chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=171s">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">17, 18 really is meant to be together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=174s">00:02:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I shared that last week.</span></div><div

questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=180s">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we're not going to go in too deep, but hopefully you'll have a better understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=184s">00:03:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of it after we go through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=187s">00:03:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the picture, it's a lady riding on a beast with seven heads, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=192s">00:03:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a dark picture so you might not be able to see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=197s">00:03:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=202s">00:03:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the beginning, chapter 17 and 18, it is not a description of God's judgment as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">previous chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=210s">00:03:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So the three different judgments that we've seen, we had the seal judgments, the trumpet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=215s">00:03:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">judgments, and then we had the final bowl judgments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=218s">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All three of them were descriptions of how judgment was going to come upon the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=223s">00:03:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=225s">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 17 and 18 is not a description of his judgment, but why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=230s">00:03:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What has brought the judgment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=232s">00:03:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a description of the rebellion of mankind, the work of the beast, specific descriptions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=238s">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of how at the end, how they're going to be united and to go against the lamb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=243s">00:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result of that, how they're going to be conquered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=246s">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's more of a description, chapter 17 and 18, of why the judgment is coming than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=251s">00:04:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the specifics of what we've been looking at up to this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=255s">00:04:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it's what is being judged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=259s">00:04:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And these chapters describe satanic kingdom in the last days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=263s">00:04:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talked about it before, how the application of this is not necessarily all chronological.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=268s">00:04:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There are certain parts of what is mentioned here is not talking just about the end times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=274s">00:04:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's talking about the satanic kingdom in totality, the world in rebellion in totality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=279s">00:04:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are parts of it where we're talking about just the very end, when Christ comes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=283s">00:04:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the ultimate, the battle of Armageddon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=287s">00:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a description of that, but all the events that lead up to that is not necessarily just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=292s">00:04:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about the end times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=293s">00:04:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So just keep that in mind, that what we're reading here is not just talking about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=297s">00:04:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very end, but the totality of satanic kingdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=303s">00:05:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to jump into two parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=305s">00:05:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the identity of the great prostitute that is introduced to us in the very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=310s">00:05:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second part of it is the explanation of that that we see in verse six and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=316s">00:05:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be two major parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=317s">00:05:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So who is this lady and what is she doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=319s">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the explanation of that at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/239535874#t=322s">00:05:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, where else do we see a woman and the relationship with the beast?</span></div><div class="c"><span
