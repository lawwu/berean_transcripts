they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=204s">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">still couldn't let go of their past.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=207s">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So they tried to incorporate some of the law into the new covenant.</span></div><div class="c"><span

authors of the New Testament is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">arguing this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=224s">00:03:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That it is not through the law, but by the grace of

20 where he says, not only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=232s">00:03:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is the law not a way of salvation for you, he says the law came to increase trespass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=239s">00:03:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">To increase trespass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=242s">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that when God gave you the law, not only did it not save you, it actually caused</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=248s">00:04:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you to sin even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=251s">00:04:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the natural question that we would ask if we read that, and if we misread that, maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=255s">00:04:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">wait a minute, does that mean that God is the author of sin?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=259s">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because clearly God gave us the law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=262s">00:04:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if Paul is saying God gave us the law and law caused us to sin more, then could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=268s">00:04:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we say the logical response to that is that God is the author of sin?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=274s">00:04:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=275s">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">By no means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=276s">00:04:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to understand the context in which Paul is saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=278s">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul is using the language basically to provoke the Jews to pay attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span

reflect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=291s">00:04:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and to look upon what he's about to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=293s">00:04:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's provoking them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=294s">00:04:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He's deliberately using that language, which would get their attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=299s">00:04:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But along with that, what Paul says here about the law is not comprehensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=304s">00:05:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He says many other things about the law in other parts of his

good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=312s">00:05:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Other parts of the letter where he says that there is a law of Christ that we ought to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=316s">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">obey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=317s">00:05:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So what he's saying here is not necessarily comprehensive, but in the context of justification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176532249#t=321s">00:05:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in the context of salvation, the law actually does
