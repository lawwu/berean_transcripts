You know, as I mentioned to you before, we're studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=137s">00:02:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Romans, and if there was any one particular book that, to me, not that any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=145s">00:02:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">other passages in the Bible is not as great, and obviously every part of the Bible is inspired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=152s">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">by God, but if there's one book that I would commend to you to really dive into and study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=157s">00:02:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and to know it well, it would be the book of Romans. Because the book of Romans is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=162s">00:02:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">written to deal with any one particular problem. Paul writes to the Galatians and Philippians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=168s">00:02:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and he has many things that he covers in these things, but they all deal with a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=173s">00:02:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that was on Paul's mind, and he deals with that. And so the Gospel message is mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=179s">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's mentioned with certain emphasis. The book of Romans is really Christianity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=183s">00:03:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in a nutshell, all of it. There's no one particular thing that he mentions above everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=189s">00:03:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">else. It's all of it is mentioned, all of it he dives into. So I would say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=193s">00:03:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if there's any one book that we really should know well what it has to say, it would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=197s">00:03:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Romans. But in the book of Romans, if we were to pick a chapter that really summarizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=204s">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the thoughts and intentions and theology of the whole book of Romans, it would be chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=208s">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">eight. So if we were to take time and really want to dive into it, I mean, we really could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=213s">00:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm not trying to milk it, we really could spend probably months and months and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=218s">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a half a year just studying the book of Romans chapter eight alone, because so much is contained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=224s">00:03:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in this chapter. And so I hesitate to go through it too fast, even three or four verses at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=230s">00:03:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a time, because we have to skim through a lot of these things, the meaning behind all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things, in order for us to be able to cover it in a reasonable amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=241s">00:04:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just commend this book to you. I commend this particular chapter to you. If you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=245s">00:04:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to memorize any chapter in the book, this is the chapter that I really would commend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=249s">00:04:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to you to know it by heart, let it shape your thought, let it shape your thinking, and it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=255s">00:04:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">affect the way you praise God, how you view the universe and what God is doing. I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=260s">00:04:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to see what we're talking about today. The subject that we're talking about is Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=263s">00:04:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering. I think it is relevant, no matter when I preach this, when this is preached,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=269s">00:04:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is relevant at all times, because I can't remember a single time, whether our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=273s">00:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was small, we had 30 or 40 people, or larger than, large as our church has become, I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=281s">00:04:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">think of any particular time that I've ever been in ministry where there wasn't somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=285s">00:04:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in church that was suffering because something going on. Some of it I'm aware of, some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=289s">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it you guys are aware of, and some of it you guys are not aware of. But this idea of Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=294s">00:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering, it is so relevant, so important to us that we have a proper understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=300s">00:05:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the context of what Paul says, in particular in this text. So before I dive into it, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=306s">00:05:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">want you to understand that we don't deal with this separately from what Paul is saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=310s">00:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, I'm not going to go through all of it, but remember in chapter 6, Paul begins to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=316s">00:05:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">answer the question, if salvation is by grace alone, if you say that it's not by your works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=323s">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not what you do, but simply by the grace of God that we're saved, isn't that going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=327s">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lead to a generation of people who are going to say, "Well, let sin that grace may abound,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=331s">00:05:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't matter, that's how great our God is, that no matter what He does, He loves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=336s">00:05:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us and we can do whatever we want." Isn't it going to lead to a life of licentiousness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=341s">00:05:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And Paul says, "Absolutely not." By no means. If an individual has truly been united with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=349s">00:05:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, he died with Christ, he was resurrected with Christ, and the Holy Spirit has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=356s">00:05:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">put into him. So it wasn't simply that, that our sins were forgiven, but we've also been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=363s">00:06:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">delivered from the power of sin. And that's why the Bible often talks about redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=369s">00:06:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and deliverance, right? Not simply for the penalty of sin, but the power of sin has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=374s">00:06:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">broken because of the presence of the Holy Spirit. So Paul has been talking about in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=380s">00:06:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 7 how the power of the Holy Spirit has caused us to be delivered from bondage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=387s">00:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but not only did we get delivered from bondage, we were made to be children of God, sons of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=392s">00:06:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">God, to call Him our Abba Father, and as a result of that, we have become co-heirs with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=397s">00:06:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. So again, up to that point, the Holy Spirit, He didn't just nullify our sins, He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=405s">00:06:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">elevated us to be co-heirs, that we have access to this Father. Now having said all of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=413s">00:06:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that is all orthodox, right? We agree on all of that. But how do we understand this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=420s">00:07:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation? If you misapply your understanding of salvation, if we project my understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=427s">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of salvation to this Gospel message, a lot of strange doctrines and practices come out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=433s">00:07:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of misapplying what we think salvation is. Years ago, when the Charismatic Movement was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=439s">00:07:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in full swing, probably about 20-25 years ago, probably more than that, maybe closer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=444s">00:07:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to 30 years ago, the Charismatic Movement was called the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=449s">00:07:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a, the Charismatic Movement, the modern day, the singing and praising and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=454s">00:07:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">band and all of this, this all came in during that period. Because prior to that, it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=458s">00:07:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were contemporary, you had one guy playing guitar, right? Typically it was an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=462s">00:07:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">organ or a piano, and that would be a traditional, and then contemporary would be one guy playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=467s">00:07:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">guitar. But during the Charismatic Movement, the worship style changed drastically. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=473s">00:07:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that stuff is just a matter of style, whether you play organ or full praise team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=478s">00:07:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that has nothing to do with genuine worship. But one of the things that was being taught</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=483s">00:08:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at that time during this Charismatic Movement was that if you genuinely believe in God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=489s">00:08:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">God will and can heal you, whatever disease you have. So there was these healing services</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=495s">00:08:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that were going on, even in conservative Presbyterian churches, Baptist churches, all of a sudden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=500s">00:08:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">were having these healing services because, again, the central figure during this time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=504s">00:08:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was a man named John Wimber, who was the leader of the Vineyard Movement. The Vineyard Church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=509s">00:08:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">still exists today, but the leader of the Vineyard Movement basically was teaching that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=512s">00:08:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you believe, if you have genuine faith, that whatever ails you, God can heal. So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=518s">00:08:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">would have traditional worship. Today we have, you know, we have the regular worship, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=522s">00:08:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the contemporary worship. Well, during that time you had the contemporary worship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=525s">00:08:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then healing service, right? All of a sudden healing services were popping up left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=529s">00:08:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and right. But the problem with this movement was that John Wimber, who was the chief proponent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=537s">00:08:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of this theology, got cancer. So everybody was watching. Well, he was telling everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=543s">00:09:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you really believe, and people would say, "Well, I went to a healing service. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=548s">00:09:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't get healed." It was because you didn't have true faith. If you really had true faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=552s">00:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you would have been healed. So the problem is with you, not me, right? Well, he got cancer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=557s">00:09:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and so obviously people were watching and praying, and years went by, and there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=561s">00:09:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">periods where they said, "Oh, he's better. He's not better." But eventually he passed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=564s">00:09:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">away because of his cancer. And so that confused a lot of people who were fully 100% in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=570s">00:09:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">movement, and there was no big turnaround saying, "That was wrong." It was just kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=575s">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of fizzled out. And that's why it's just not, you know, these days you don't hear a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=579s">00:09:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">about it, but about 20, 30 years ago, it was just as popular as anything that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=584s">00:09:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">see today. It's because in their mind, even though they had the correct gospel, their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=591s">00:09:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">application, what salvation meant. Salvation meant that you're going to be physically healed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=597s">00:09:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Something I think a little bit more relevant today that's been around for a long time is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=601s">00:10:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the health and wealth gospel. I remember years ago, there was a popular speaker, and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=606s">00:10:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this man named Fred Price was a pastor of a very large church, a mega church in LA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=613s">00:10:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and his church was called the Faith Dome. And it used to be a sports arena that he turned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=617s">00:10:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it into his church, and he had tens of thousands of people meeting there. And then every Sunday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=622s">00:10:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">morning he would preach. And I didn't know his theology. I just thought, "Oh, this guy's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=626s">00:10:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a really good communicator." So I would listen to him every once in a while. But I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=630s">00:10:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one Sunday he had people stand up and he said, "Anybody here who's on welfare stand up."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=636s">00:10:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And people very reluctantly stood up. And when they stood up, he just ripped into them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=640s">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "The reason why you guys are on welfare is because you don't have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=643s">00:10:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">faith. God can deliver you from poverty." And he would just rip on them. And obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=649s">00:10:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I'm watching this, I'm cringing. And then the next thing he would have them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=652s">00:10:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sit down. And then he said, "Those of you who used to be on welfare, who used to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=656s">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">poor, didn't have a job, but now you do." And then you get up. And everybody gets up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=660s">00:11:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and people start clapping. It's because these people believed. And God delivered them from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=665s">00:11:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">poverty. And whatever sickness they had, God delivered them. And people would all clap,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=671s">00:11:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he would begin to share about his wealth. You know, and that's why, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=675s">00:11:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have faith like his, you can have this wealth yourself. Right? Now you guys are at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=681s">00:11:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a Bible teaching church, so we look at that and say, "That's ridiculous. Why would people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=685s">00:11:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even fall for that?" Right? We don't believe it on paper. We never signed a doctrinal statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=693s">00:11:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we examine ourselves carefully, you will find just how prominent this health and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=699s">00:11:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wealth gospel is, even in your life.

How often do we celebrate and thank God when God answers our prayer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=721s">00:12:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and we get a raise?

It's because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=757s">00:12:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul qualifies that by the Holy Spirit, we have become co-heirs with Christ.

So Paul, again, he's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=778s">00:12:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">arguing now, in case that you get a wrong understanding what salvation is, he says in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=784s">00:13:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 17, "If children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=789s">00:13:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him." It's kind of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/194936956#t=796s">00:13:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, build them up.
