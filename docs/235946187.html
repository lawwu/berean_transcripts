<span class="t">in reference, in contrast to the Beauty and the Beast, Beauty, not the Beauty, the Beast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=100s">00:01:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the last two weeks is kind of a set up for this conflict that we're going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=104s">00:01:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in chapter 16.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=108s">00:01:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the bowl judgments, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=112s">00:01:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And out of the three separate judgments that we've seen, the seal judgments, and then what's</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=124s">00:02:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And which is the most intense out of the three?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=128s">00:02:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The bowl judgments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=129s">00:02:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've been seeing an increase of intensity of judgment for each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=132s">00:02:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the seal judgment starts, again, if you look at it, it's pretty intense too, but then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=137s">00:02:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of steps it up in the trumpet judgments, and then we haven't even seen the seal judgments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=142s">00:02:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but all of this is in preparation for us to get to the seal judgments, which is in chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=147s">00:02:27.480</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=149s">00:02:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what happens after chapter 16 is the end result of this conflict, and then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=153s">00:02:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">get into, again, that Satan is bound, there's a thousand year reign of Christ, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=158s">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's description of the new heaven and new earth, and then there's, again, a description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=163s">00:02:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of eternity at the very end in

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=167s">00:02:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 14 and 15 is in reference to the Lamb of God, right, today's theme, and his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=177s">00:02:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">preparation and his angels and the worship of heaven, but the previous two chapters where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=182s">00:03:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we're looking at the activity of the beast and the dragon, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=186s">00:03:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where the theme is from, the beauty and the beast, in contrast, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=189s">00:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So today, we're going to be looking at what's going to lead up to chapter 16.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=194s">00:03:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember we talked about that in the last chapter, what was it, what were we on, 14,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=198s">00:03:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">13, so starting from chapter 12 where we started the second session, all the way to chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=202s">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">15, all of it is kind of like the background behind what's going to bring chapter 16.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=208s">00:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Was it meant to be taken chronologically?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=214s">00:03:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it explains all the activity of Satan from the very beginning of its creation until the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=220s">00:03:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">end times, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=222s">00:03:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same thing here, if we look at chapter 14 and 15, it's the description of the activity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=227s">00:03:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Lamb of God all the way up to the end times, and then these things are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=231s">00:03:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">clash, and then when that clash happens, we see chapter 16, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=236s">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Bits and pieces of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=241s">00:04:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the beginning, the contrast between chapter, I put chapter 13 and 14, but really it's chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=246s">00:04:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">12, 13 versus chapter 14 and 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=249s">00:04:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So these two chapters are going to contrast with what was happening in the two chapters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=254s">00:04:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we looked at prior to this week, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=258s">00:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you remember, the end of chapter 13 ends with the mark of the beast, 666.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=263s">00:04:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Either it's going to be on the forearm or the forehead, and all the world is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=269s">00:04:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">receive this number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=272s">00:04:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the consequence of this is that there's going to be economic consequences for those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=276s">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who do not get this number, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=278s">00:04:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how chapter 13 ends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=280s">00:04:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then chapter 14 begins with mark of the Father, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=285s">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we see a one who is like the Son of Man, and then 144,000 who is in its presence, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=293s">00:04:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to be having the mark of the Father

what's happening in chapter 13 and what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=301s">00:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">happening in the

satanic work all throughout redemptive history, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235946187#t=314s">00:05:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what
