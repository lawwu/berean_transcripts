One is, again, because it's a general review and we're going over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=9s">00:00:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">19 chapters, so we're not, we're just, all we're going to be doing is going over just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=17s">00:00:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like the broad outline. Is this too loud? Yeah, broad outline of the 19, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=24s">00:00:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">technically it's going to be up to 23 chapters. And then after that portion, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=32s">00:00:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have, we're going to play some games, okay? Well, it's actually not a game. I'm just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=36s">00:00:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask you a question, you're going to answer, okay? It is a game. It's going to be no-frills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=43s">00:00:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">game. So basically what's going to happen is, I'm going to tally up the points. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=47s">00:00:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be based on the outline that I gave you. We're going to be going over the outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=52s">00:00:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to have the fill-ins. I'm going to go over the outline. And then the questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=55s">00:00:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm going to be asking you is going to be related, mostly related to the outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=60s">00:01:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I wanted to do this is kind of to reemphasize twice, and then I'll give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=66s">00:01:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you time to discuss and think through. So the goal of the review is not so that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=73s">00:01:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can like know here's the flow and know all the details of each chapter. So at the minimum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=79s">00:01:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see the broad outline. And then if I said chapter 3, you know, you kind of know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=85s">00:01:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on in chapter 3. If I said chapter 13, you kind of know what's going on in chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=90s">00:01:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">13. And then all the major prophesies, messianic prophecies, that you kind of know where it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=95s">00:01:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is. So that when you think of the book of Isaiah, at least for the first 23 chapters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=100s">00:01:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll have a broad outline that's memorized in your head. So that's the goal today, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=105s">00:01:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not going to get into too much detail today because again, the purpose of this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=110s">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to ingrain in you the outline of the book of Isaiah that we're up to. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=116s">00:01:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so do you have any leftover on tables, anybody? You know, I forgot to email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=125s">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">again. So if you need more, raise your hand. If you have more at your table, raise your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=139s">00:02:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">hand. Okay. Okay. So just to kind of give you, if you look at the outline, you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=162s">00:02:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's A, B, and C. A, B, C. And so up to chapter 23, it's broken down into three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=171s">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">large, okay, thematic. It doesn't fit perfectly, but I think for the purpose of your memorization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=180s">00:03:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the first one, let me see. Somebody at this table, can you read A for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=188s">00:03:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">us? Johnny? Okay. So that's chapter one through six is about the description of Israel's rebellion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=202s">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and God's restoration. Okay? And then so the six chapters broadly fit under that topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=209s">00:03:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter B, if I can have Jonas. Okay. So again, not every single chapter may fall under that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=224s">00:03:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but from chapter seven through chapter 12 is promise of deliverance for God's remnant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=229s">00:03:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? And then C, God's judgment of the nations. So I only have up to chapter 20 because that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=235s">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all we covered, but that theme actually takes us all the way to chapter 23. Okay? So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=242s">00:04:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just think in our heads, even before we start. Chapter one through six is. All right, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=254s">00:04:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. One more time. Chapter one through six, Israel's rebellion against God and plan of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=263s">00:04:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">restoration. That's one through six. Okay. Chapter seven through 12, promise of deliverance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=269s">00:04:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of God's remnant. Okay. So it's pretty easy. You got, you got 12 chapters already. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=276s">00:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last part of it from chapter 13 to 23 is God's judgment to the nation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=282s">00:04:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Review done. Right? So that's, so I, what I want you to remember at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=288s">00:04:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is that three large, you know, themes. First theme, don't look at it this time. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=305s">00:05:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel's rebellion against God and God's plan for restoration. B. So it'd be a choir to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=322s">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be like. All right. And then third is God's judgment of the nations. Okay. So that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=328s">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">broad outline. So what we're going to be talking about is filling the details of what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=334s">00:05:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want you to pay attention to, to the outline. Try to memorize it as much as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=338s">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can, because after I'm done reviewing or going over it, we're going to, I'm going to be asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=343s">00:05:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. And the questions I'm going to be asking is, I'm going to give you a verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=347s">00:05:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to ask you what chapter that's in. Okay. And then I'm going to have you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=351s">00:05:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">raise hand, tell me what chapter that's in. And the verses are kind of taken out based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=356s">00:05:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">upon the themes in here. Okay. So if you know the theme well, when the, when the verse comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=363s">00:06:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">up, it'll be easier for you to raise your hand. And if your table wins, we'll have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=369s">00:06:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gift card for you to go out and eat with your table. Okay. With your table. All right. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=378s">00:06:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">15 bucks, dollar per person. All right. No, I was just kidding. A real, real meal for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=389s">00:06:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">your small group. Okay. But it has to be, you can't deviate up. You have to go with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=393s">00:06:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">your small group. Okay. All right. Let's begin. Oops, sorry. Okay. This is just kind of a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=402s">00:06:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">before we get into it, just a quick review of Israel's history. Okay. Just, just remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=412s">00:06:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a lot of you guys already know this, but just Israel's history, it begins with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=416s">00:06:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Saul. Saul's the first King of Israel. His son is David. David's son is Solomon. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=421s">00:07:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then Solomon's child, Rehoboam, right? So after he dies, Rehoboam is the rightful successor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=429s">00:07:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, of the throne. But what ends up happening is Rehoboam decides that he's going to, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=436s">00:07:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to cause them to pay heavy tax. And so the nation of Israel gets angry and Jeroboam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=442s">00:07:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">leads the rebellion against Israel and he takes 10 of the tribes and then he goes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=447s">00:07:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">north. And so the kingdom splits in half. So the two tribes, tribe of Judah, tribe of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=452s">00:07:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Benjamin stays with Rehoboam. So even though neither of them are righteous, right? This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=458s">00:07:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">split happens, humanly speaking, because Rehoboam chooses to, you know, take advantage of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=465s">00:07:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people and these people take off. So ever since then, ever since this happens, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=470s">00:07:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">two kingdoms that split, right? And so this kingdom, it keeps, it keeps going. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=477s">00:07:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the kingdom that we call the, the Northern Kingdom. They have 10 tribes. They're the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=485s">00:08:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ones who fall into captivity, but to the Assyrians first, right? And then later on the Babylonians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=491s">00:08:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">take the Southern Kingdom. Okay. When does the prophecy of Isaiah take place? Has any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=500s">00:08:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of these kingdoms fallen yet? Not yet. These guys are about to fall. They didn't fall yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=508s">00:08:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So he is prophesying during this period to the Southern Kingdom and he's prophesying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=514s">00:08:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about what's happening with these guys, but then, but he's also saying that this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=519s">00:08:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing is going to happen to you. Okay. So that's the background behind Isaiah's prophecy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=524s">00:08:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yes. All right. So just, just kind of give you a heads up on a quick history of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=531s">00:08:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">game. Israel is right here, Jerusalem. So the Northern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=539s">00:08:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll start with this. Southern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem, this area. Northern Kingdom splits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=543s">00:09:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they end up going into this area. Okay. So this here together is Israel, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=549s">00:09:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the Southern Kingdom is located down here and then the Northern Kingdom is up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=554s">00:09:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now so much of Israel's history is about their interaction with three major kingdoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=562s">00:09:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the Egyptians down here and you have the Assyrians and the Babylonians are at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=568s">00:09:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time that, that Isaiah is prophesying Babylon, Babylon has not taken over this yet. So Assyria</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=574s">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is here. Babylon is in the outer sides of over here. Eventually they're going to conquer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=579s">00:09:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyria and then this is going to be the Babylonian kingdom. Okay. Eventually. Right. So Isaiah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=585s">00:09:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is prophesying during this period where if they, if Israel wanted to survive, humanly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=591s">00:09:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, they have to attach themselves with one of these kingdoms. So in order to protect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=597s">00:09:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves from Assyria, sometimes they would pay tribute to Babylon, right? Or sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=602s">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they will pay tribute to the Egypt or Cush. So different nations hoping that if we ally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=607s">00:10:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with them, that they're going to help us. And so a lot of God's prophecies in book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=612s">00:10:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Isaiah is telling them that you think you're safe because you have some sort of alliance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=617s">00:10:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with the Babylonians, but in the end they're also going to be humbled. They're also going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=621s">00:10:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be judged, right? That your hope is placed in the wrong place. You should have hoped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=625s">00:10:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in God and not these people. So a lot of Isaiah's prophecies is about them jockeying position</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=632s">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and putting their trust in these foreign nations. Okay. All right. That's a brief background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=640s">00:10:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go. Um, a Israel's rebellion against God and his plan of restoration. So chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=647s">00:10:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one, if you remember Israel's sin of not recognizing their master, remember the, the verse here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=653s">00:10:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that donkeys, the animals recognize their master, but Israel does not. Right? So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=660s">00:11:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">begins as an indictment. So that it's kind of like a courtroom where the lawyer is standing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=665s">00:11:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Isaiah is kind of like the lawyer standing, indicting the nation of Israel. This is, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=669s">00:11:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is your sin and here's how you sinned against God. Right? And that's basically chapter one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=675s">00:11:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Within that chapter, remember we talked about false religion, like all your temple worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=681s">00:11:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifices. They're meaningless to me because why, why were they meaningless? They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=686s">00:11:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to appease God with their false religion. They're rebelling against God in every other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=690s">00:11:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">area, but they thought if they came to the temple and gave sacrifices, that somehow that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=695s">00:11:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was going to make up for what they were doing outside of the temple. But God saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=699s">00:11:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">false religion is not going to have any effect on God. In fact, it's angering God. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=707s">00:11:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it, if you notice in your outline, you'll see indentations on some of these, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=713s">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You have ABCD and then you have some indention that says, I, you know, one or two, all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=719s">00:11:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">indentations I indented it because those are where God breaks in in the midst of prophesying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=724s">00:12:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment. He breaks in and says, but God's not going to be angry forever. And then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=728s">00:12:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">talks about restoration. So all the indentation is where God breaks in and says, he's, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=734s">00:12:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to one day forget that and he's going to forget. Okay. So again, we're still in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=741s">00:12:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter one, 21 to 31, the fall and restoration of God's righteous city.

And then he says, your trust and riches and foreign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=759s">00:12:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">powers will fail you because they will be judged. So as we're going through it, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=763s">00:12:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have your Bibles, I encourage you guys to open your, keep your Bibles open and flip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=768s">00:12:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through it. Okay. So if you have your Bibles, just flip through it as we're going through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=774s">00:12:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it, as you see this and filling it in, just take a quick glance so that you'll know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=779s">00:12:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about.

F, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=791s">00:13:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">will take away our self-confidence and supply soldiers, leaders, and beauty. Right? Remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=798s">00:13:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked about that, how they're, they feel like their safety is going to be in aligning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=803s">00:13:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with the right people or they have the right leaders or, you know, it talks about at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=807s">00:13:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">end of chapter three, about the reliance and the beauty and how God's going to come and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=812s">00:13:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">take away all of that, all the superficial things that, that you're depending on again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=818s">00:13:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the first break in, in chapter four, two to six talks about the branch of the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=823s">00:13:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Remember how God's going to wipe them out. It's only going to leave a stump. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=830s">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from that stump is going to come the branch of the Lord. It talks about how the branch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=834s">00:13:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Lord is going to restore Israel. Right? Chapter five, one through seven, he describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=841s">00:14:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel as a vineyard, how he planted and cultivated.

So again, systematically God is indicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=854s">00:14:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Right? And then the woe statements, chapter five, eight through 30, woe to those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=861s">00:14:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">who trust and pursue riches above God. Okay. So after we go through this, and just before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=877s">00:14:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I get into the second section, I'm going to give you maybe about five, ten minutes just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=881s">00:14:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of go through your, with your small group, review this with them, with your small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=887s">00:14:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">group, and then I'm going to start asking questions and see who raises their hand and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=890s">00:14:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then, and then we'll play games a little bit. Okay. And then chapter six, one through 13</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=899s">00:14:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is the famous call of Isaiah.

Second section, B, promise of deliverance for God's remnant. God will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=965s">00:16:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">protect Ahaz from Syria. Remember this passage in chapter seven, one through nine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=971s">00:16:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">What happened here? Syria and Ephraim. Ephraim is another name for the Northern Kingdom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=976s">00:16:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So what, what, what does Syria and Ephraim do? They, they came to Ahaz and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=987s">00:16:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">ally with us so we can fight against Assyria. Ahaz chooses not to and he, he ends up allying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=993s">00:16:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">with somebody else and so they get angry and then he, they, they come to attack him. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=998s">00:16:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's at that time God sends Isaiah to tell him that, no, you, God's gonna protect you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1003s">00:16:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">God's not done with you.

And again, he breaks in in the middle of that and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1012s">00:16:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">says, you know, tell Ahaz that God said this and Ahaz, does he believe it? No, he doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1017s">00:16:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">believe it. It's like, oh, how do I, how can I be sure God's gonna do this? And he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1021s">00:17:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you a sign of Emmanuel, right? That he's gonna come through a virgin. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1027s">00:17:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where the famous, you know, prophecy about the, about Emmanuel.

And then he says, God's going to bring Assyria to bring judgment upon Damascus and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1042s">00:17:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Samaria.

God's gonna raise up Assyria and instead of protecting yourself, God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1054s">00:17:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">gonna actually judge you. And again, it breaks in chapter 9, 1 through 7, the promise of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1061s">00:17:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a, promise of a child. Okay. A little bit higher. Okay. Second part. Okay. God's anger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1076s">00:17:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">burns against Israel and their leaders for all, remember this phrase? He repeats it about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1080s">00:18:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">five, six times. And it's to remind the nation of Israel, even though all this judgment is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1085s">00:18:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">coming, that you refuse to return. So therefore, he says, for all, for all his anger has not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1092s">00:18:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">turned away and his hand is stretched out. In other words, he's not done with you. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1095s">00:18:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment is gonna, is gonna be much heavier than you think. Right? Because they refuse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1100s">00:18:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to repent. And then again, I remind Assyria is gonna, as God's agent and target, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1109s">00:18:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to be the target of God's judgment. Right? So it's not that Assyria was righteous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1115s">00:18:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they were just used as an instrument.

God allows Satan to work, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1120s">00:18:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bring upon judgment, but ultimately the greatest judgment is reserved for Satan himself. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1126s">00:18:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's kind of like the argument here in chapter 10.

Right? That's not the case at all. There's a lot of times where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1160s">00:19:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">God would use agents like Assyria or Babylon and just because it produces fruit doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1165s">00:19:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">mean that God, God favors that.

God can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1170s">00:19:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">donkeys, he can use rocks. So Assyria is a good example of a nation where God uses, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1177s">00:19:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't because God favored them. Right? And again, a remnant of Israel will return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1183s">00:19:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to Jerusalem in chapter 10, 20 to 34.

All right. So this part we're going to go over pretty quick because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1213s">00:20:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">each section obviously has, he has his own judgment against them. If you remember the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1217s">00:20:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Babylon when remember when Babylon falls, what was the response of the people? Mocking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1229s">00:20:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">them by celebration because the tyrant is gone. Right? Judgment on Assyria. Remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1249s">00:20:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we told you about how Isaiah is not written chronologically. This is a perfect example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1254s">00:20:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of that. Does Babylon come after Assyria or does Assyria come after Babylon? Assyria comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1261s">00:21:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">before Babylon. Right? But in the prophecy Babylon and then he jumps back to Assyria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1266s">00:21:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just any chronological order. It's thematic. Philistia, there's a short</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1272s">00:21:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">blurb on them.

He's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1278s">00:21:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">thorough. Right? Just as God is thorough with his love and grace, he's thorough with his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1283s">00:21:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment. Remember in the New Testament he says every every careless word, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1288s">00:21:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to be accountable for.

So God's judgment is just as thorough as his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1298s">00:21:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">love and grace. Judgment of Moab. What was unique about Moab?

So if you look at the history between between Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1324s">00:22:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and Moabites, there are periods when they're allies and there are periods when they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1328s">00:22:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">fighting against each other but they're like cousins. Right? Just like Ephraim. Okay. Damascus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1336s">00:22:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Cush.

And then judgment of Egypt. Then we didn't I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1386s">00:23:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it read but yours I didn't I forgot to take out. Okay. Remember how I talked about at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1393s">00:23:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the very end he talks about judgment but because of his judgment what happens? Right? At the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1400s">00:23:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">end they repent and the remnant of them come back and they said that Egypt, Assyria, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1405s">00:23:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel are going to be all united as one and they're going to be a blessing to all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1409s">00:23:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">other people. Right? So basically if you if you talk about Egypt, Assyria, and Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/153364427#t=1415s">00:23:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">they're talking about that piece of land.
