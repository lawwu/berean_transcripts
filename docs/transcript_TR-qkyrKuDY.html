Good evening, everybody. As a introductory note, would like everybody to know that we did remove the two front rows so that when we, after the time of singing praise, if you'd like to come up and kneel to pray, you can fill the front area as you please, and if there's no room, you can just come up right up to the stairs as well.</p><p>As an additional note, not as any kind of requirement, but as a suggestion, I do suggest you to pray audibly, meaning articulate your words. That's not to say that God does not hear your silent prayers or that he does not know your mind, but although God knows your heart and every need, he desires you to ask, and if we're gonna confess, then we should confess with our mouths, and what's more, in the same way that we sing with passion, we should be praying with passion as well, and so again, not as a requirement or not trying to make you do something you're not accustomed to, but my guess is it's difficult to concentrate and focus in silence for 30 minutes, but it actually takes that much more concentration and focus to put into words all that we're thinking, feeling, and desiring for God to hear, amen?</p><p>So would you join with me now in a word of prayer as we begin service with time of praise? Let's pray. Our Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God. Although we are undeserving, to know that you, as the God of the universe, you hear our every individual prayer.</p><p>It's astounding. We know, Father God, that you bestow on us your love, you give to us mercy every single day in Christ. Thank you, God, that you hear us, and I ask, Father Lord, that we would then have such a sense of privilege, we would have the sense of gratitude, we would be always in wonder and amazement and at all of the kind of care that you show us, and we pray, God, that as we join together, uniting our voices to sing to you, to pray to you, Lord God, this would be a blessed time.</p><p>It's in Christ's name, amen.

Good evening again and tonight as we take time to pray, I'm gonna be guiding our thought on a central theme about such a common problem that it feels like we can have an amazing week in the Lord and just fall into it the day after.</p><p>And I am talking about the problem of apathy. You know, when we think about our hearts, sometimes because there are circumstances and situations where we're just fatigued, or actually when we think about the things of God like Sunday worship, Bible study, and even prayer meetings, there is the problem of repetitiveness, redundancy, or something that seems so routine.</p><p>But we recognize that upon examination of our hearts, and we need to do it often, the problem isn't that we have the same thing every week or every month. Because we're gonna come into worship every week. Because even when we think about our prayer meetings, are we not gonna pray over the same things that we've prayed over before?</p><p>We're gonna be praying over our sins and confessing them. We're gonna be praying over the topics that people share. We're gonna be praying over the things that we struggle with and the needs of the church, et cetera, et cetera. And so I wanna give just a first encouragement that we have to center our minds on fighting this common problem that happens so regularly, even aside from the fact that yes, we are participating in things that we commonly always do.</p><p>The scripture says in Isaiah chapter 29, verse 13, "Then the Lord said, 'Because these people draw near me "with their words and honor me with their lip service, "but they remove their hearts far from me, "and their reverence for me consists of tradition "learned by rote.'" We're familiar with this because Jesus quoted it himself, that God is incredibly, for lack of better words, annoyed, is distasteful, when there is just simply lip service.</p><p>God is not accepting of just ritualistic traditions. It is not okay if we just simply show up on time because it's time. It's time to worship, it's time to pray. So my challenge tonight is going to be let us pray that things like this we have the proper attitude.</p><p>Let's pray that we don't grow tired or worrisome of services or times like this, but rather we see it as an attitude of true, unique privilege, amen? This is for me. Let's have that kind of attitude. And I wanna put up a couple of prayer points, things to put off and things to put on for us.</p><p>We wanna take time to examine, we wanna take time to evaluate, are there certain thoughts or attitudes in my heart so that we guard against any kind of apathy that is growing? First and foremost, as you would commonly suspect, the greatest source of apathy is undelt sin. So as in previous maybe times of coming together to pray, I wanna ask, are there sins by which we have not confessed, either past or present, or even if it feels like, well the moment has passed, it's already been two weeks, whatever it may be, if somewhere in your mind you thought of your sin as it's just a bruise and I'm gonna heal, you're deceived.</p><p>It leaves God completely out of the picture. Let's take time to confess. Why? Because any unconfessed sin causes us to be careless. You recall back in the Old Testament that when an individual thought, you know what? I know this lamb is blemished, the lamb is blind, the lamb is this, but let's just offer it up.</p><p>He'll take whatever we give. That kind of carelessness is indicative of apathy. What's more, I ask you this question. By chance do you come tonight with a level of disappointment? With a level of no expectation? I come, I pray, nothing happened last time. What's the use? A level of discouragement.</p><p>A level of kind of like almost there to quit mentality. Pray for perseverance. Pray for a heart that's willing to wait on the Lord. And then there's this question of is there any part of you that is no longer, or in this time, amazed at the incredible grace God has given you?</p><p>Is there a level of thanklessness in you? Please take time now just to think about where your heart is if any part of you have come into this place with a sense of apathy. I'm gonna give you some time to privately pray. Let me lead us by saying a quick word.</p><p>Let's pray. Father God, you have taught the people from long ago not to come into your presence completely burdened to come, but rather, God, with amazement, with thoughts of you. I pray, Father God, that as we have joined together, let our hearts rise to you and do a spiritual work in us, God, that you would challenge us to fight, to guard our hearts against all forms of apathy.</p><p>We pray now, God, you would hear our prayers. Amen. Just to mention again, because I forgot to give you time, if anybody would like to come up to kneel and pray, please go ahead and do that now for the next five minutes. Again, the topics that are right behind me, please go ahead and pray over the things that we need to put off, the questions to examine our hearts, and then in about five minutes, we'll continue on with more worship.</p><p>Thank you.

And so, if our hearts are growing apathetic, there's this question. The grand purposes of God for his kingdom, the joy of God's heart for salvation, we have to pray for that.</p><p>If there is any kind of apathy in your heart where you feel like kind of frustrated because you are doing technically all the right things, all the expected things, the Bible study, the sharing, the discussion questions, all of that, let's pray for this. On the screen, we're gonna put up a couple more prayer topics.</p><p>First, the passage from Matthew. Jesus said, "What do you think? "If any man has a hundred sheep "and one of them has gone astray, "does he not leave the 99 on the mountains "and go in search for the one that is strained? "If it turns out that he finds it, "truly I say to you, he rejoices over it "more than over the 99 which have gone astray.</p><p>"So is it not the will of your Father who is in heaven "that one of these little ones perishes?" So, in highlighting this passage, Jesus is talking not about a strategy, but just simply the joy of God's heart in seeing one lost sheep coming to salvation. So, let's pray.</p><p>Let's pray that our hearts are enlargened, our spiritual sight is just blown away by the incredible heart of God, and that our heart then would be in accordance with his for the grand kingdom that he is building. And so now, also, let's pray all the names that come to your mind of loved ones, all the individuals in your immediate vicinity, the people that you come across who need to hear the message, who have heard or perhaps aren't coming around.</p><p>Let's lift them up in prayer at this time. Please go ahead and go right into it, and I'll come back to give the next segment. (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) - Allow me to pray to close off that topic.</p><p>Heavenly Father, we sang together that you would use everything in our lives. And so Father, we pray that at our church, God, we're so blessed with equipping and preaching. Use it, Lord, for your glory. Lord God, we're blessed with fellowship, community. Use that, Lord God, for your glory. And Lord, everything then we have in life, all the resources you've blessed us with, use that for your glory.</p><p>As we take time to think, Lord God, that our church has hundreds of kids. Use us, Father God, to show them faith and the love of the Lord Jesus that conquers everything. And I pray, Father God, we would have eyes to see, not just cute kids, precious kids, not just individuals who are attendants and new visitors, but God, help us to see with spiritual eyes, as you do, Lord, that we would see the lost and their desperate need.</p><p>But Lord God, then that we would be convicted and moved to do everything in our power to show them the glory of Christ. We thank you in Christ's name, amen. As we think about guarding our hearts against apathy, you know, one of the greatest just lines of biblical counseling is just simply this, what do you want?</p><p>The moment we are apathetic about the Lord Jesus is because foolishly we want something else. And God had given us this warning in the scriptures in Matthew chapter six, verse 20, it says, "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven "where neither moth nor rust destroys "and where thieves do not break in or steal.</p><p>"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Jesus taught us this treasure principle. In as much as we're staring at the building of the account, in as much as we have hope of collecting and collecting, and the more that we have our investment, and the more that we admire that investment, there our heart will be.</p><p>And so, what is it that we want? What is it that we're staring at that we admire so much? What are some of these treasures? Another way to put it, A.W. Tozer said in a book, he says, "There is this principle also of being impressed. "The way Satan gets us to be apathetic "is to simply impress us with all the lesser things of life." So, the exact same thing stated another way is, what are you impressed with?</p><p>Are you so impressed with the things shown on YouTube? So impressed with people's, whatever it may be, their homes, their makeovers, their this and that, how they do things, their sports, their performances, their songs. Are we so apathetic because we're so impressed with all the wrong things? So, as we put up the next set of prayer topics and the passage there, please pray with these evaluation questions, and if you brought your notebook or something to write on, this is the time to get real specific.</p><p>What is it in your heart that's a precious treasure? You feel at an incredible loss if you don't have it. What are your personal ambitions to such a degree where you've been planning, you've been researching, you've been giving all of your attention to that particular thing? What are you coveting in other people where you're so impressed because the people that you feel like have made it or have succeeded are the people who have actually fulfilled your ambitions?</p><p>If that's you, as you evaluate, let's pray for humility. Let's pray in actual submission to say, "Lord, rather than asking you to rip this out of my hand, "here it is first. "I volitionally surrender it to you." Are there any areas where you lack trust? You're just in fear, particularly if you're parents, you're afraid your children will not be happy, your children will not be as educated, your children will fall behind.</p><p>Are there any areas where you're lacking trust in your own personal arenas? In your own advancement? In your own happiness? In these things, please take time as you pray to get very specific. Sometimes we raise questions like this and it's so broad. Basically, I can summarize it, "What are you struggling with?" But this is the time to get really specific with God and say, "God, I trust you with my salvation.</p><p>"I trust you with everything else "but here in this arena, "I have a hard time trusting you." Be honest, be confessional, be candid. Are you distracted? As again, I brought up how A.W. Tozer put it, "Are you distracted and impressed by the world?" Let's pray. Let's pray as King David did when he said to God, "I will put no unworthy or worthless thing "before my eyes." That is your choice.</p><p>That's your action. That's your decision. What will you put before your face? What will you enjoy and pass the time? But rather, let's pray for a great, great vision before the Lord that we would have an ongoing meditation and growing knowledge of our Lord Jesus. Please go ahead and take those topics and pray.</p><p>(soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music) ♪ Oh, kneel me down again ♪ ♪ Here at your feet ♪ ♪ Show me how much you love ♪ ♪ Humility ♪ ♪ Oh, spirit be the star ♪ ♪ That leads me to ♪ ♪ The humble heart of love ♪ ♪ I see in you ♪ ♪ You are the God of the broken ♪ ♪ The friend of the weak ♪ ♪ You wash the feet of the weary ♪ ♪ Embrace the ones in need ♪ ♪ I want to be like you, Jesus ♪ ♪ To have this heart in me ♪ ♪ You are the God of the humble ♪ ♪ You are the humble ♪ ♪ Oh, kneel me down again ♪ ♪ Here at your feet ♪ ♪ Show me how much you love ♪ ♪ Humility ♪ ♪ Oh, spirit be the star ♪ ♪ That leads me to ♪ ♪ The humble heart of love ♪ ♪ I see in you ♪ ♪ You are the God of the broken ♪ ♪ The friend of the weak ♪ ♪ You wash the feet of the weary ♪ ♪ Embrace the ones in need ♪ ♪ I want to be like you, Jesus ♪ ♪ To have this heart in me ♪ ♪ You are the God of the humble ♪ ♪ You are the humble ♪ ♪ You are the God of the broken ♪ ♪ The friend of the weak ♪ ♪ You wash the feet of the weary ♪ ♪ Embrace the ones in need ♪ ♪ I want to be like you, Jesus ♪ ♪ To have this heart in me ♪ ♪ You are the God of the humble ♪ ♪ You are the humble ♪ ♪ You are the God of the humble ♪ ♪ You are the humble ♪ - In our last segment of our prayer time, after I explain the topics, I will break you guys up into the three, or you can just pray if you're here with your family.</p><p>But we have a lot of stuff going on, but these are just some highlights of some corporate prayer topics. One, as you guys know, the college ministry, their summer is wrapping up, and they have already been gearing up for the ministry on campus, getting ready for the influx of new students, and this year they're going to different campuses as well.</p><p>So let's really pray for, at the start of the calendar academic year for effective ministry, let's pray that those opportunities to engage the students are really fruitful. They have planned various events from welcome lunches, et cetera. So let's pray that all of those will be effective. Secondly, as each period goes by, we do hear of a lot of individuals where they're either learning that beloved family members are either sick severely.</p><p>We sometimes hear that there are passing of loved ones, whether it's grandparents or even father, mother. If you are aware, in the little pod, you can bring it up and pray, but also we would request one prayer for Elder James. So as you guys know, Diane was pregnant, but she suffered from preeclampsia, and when she went in on emergency notice, soon after she had to deliver, but the baby was only 26 weeks.</p><p>So that's roughly three months early. So let's pray for health both for Diane and the baby. The baby's name is Clement. Because the baby is so young and so small, there is still like a worry for complication. Sometimes there are breathing complications and various difficulty. So let's really lift them up to the Lord.</p><p>Finally, the Taiwan missions team, we've been meeting this month. We have our next training and meeting just in a week or two. As the team goes out in October, please pray that it will be a successful trip where we can have divinely appointed opportunities to meet and converse with the people there.</p><p>We will be primarily working with college students. Just about every day we'll be on campus, either doing a cultural exchange, English corner, discussion time, tours of the campus, tours of classrooms, and then we've also planned a time to whoever we meet to have an all-day activity. We're going and doing a hike and a long walk together.</p><p>So let's really pray that God will prepare our hearts as a team, prepare hearts of the people that we'll talk to, and have a really fruitful time of ministry out there. So I'm going to go ahead and request that you guys look around, take initiative to get into pockets of three.</p><p>We'll pray over these things and then close off with a closing song. Thank you.

Let's pray together.</p><p>Father God, we do want to, with all of our hearts, thank you. God, thank you that you are the one washing us with your word, challenging us to mature and grow. I thank you, God, with your fatherly love, your putting away the things that are ignoble and causing us to be all the more conformed to your son.</p><p>And it is our prayer that you will cause us to mature in both our mind, the conviction, Lord God, of the principles of scripture, but also, Lord, maturing our hearts, that we will be passionate about the right things, that, God, we would never be apathetic about the kingdom of the Lord or the things that have to do with Christ, but rather we will grow, we'll grow in faith and love.</p><p>We thank you, God, this day that you heard our prayers. It's in Christ's name, amen. Thank you, everybody. As a final couple announcements, number one, the shuttle service to the far lots will be going, but will stop at 9.30, so after you have time of fellowship, please make sure you make your way out to the lot.</p><p>Also, we need your help to reset our sanctuary back for service. Please help us roll away the carpet to that side of the sanctuary for the storage, and please do help us on either side. We have brown chairs that we need to reset and put the tables back in.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p></div></body></html>
