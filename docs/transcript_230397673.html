Meanwhile, Nemesis hears of their plans and comes to planet Earth to be super, super duper bad. - Oh man, those Groots man, they sure almost got me. But I can't believe I escaped them. Those ginormous Groots gave me such a hoot.</p><p>But you know what? Now that we're on planet Earth, I am going to get Captain Korp and score. (laughs) (children cheering) - Nice. - Nice. - There you go. - That was fun. - Wait. - Oh, sorry. - Wait, what are they doing? Weren't they trying to hurt him?</p><p>Why are they playing together? - Okay, let's try again. - Why are they having fun together? - Ready, set, go. - I don't like this at all. I do not like this at all. - I'm so glad we can become friends and play together. - Yeah, we're Groot. - I never thought I'd be friends with you guys, but thank you for sharing the gospel with me, Korp and score.</p><p>- Of course, it's cool. I mean, we all make mistakes, and as long as you understand you need to change and repent. - Yeah, all my bad friends are super confused by how much I've changed. I mean, looking back, I can't believe all the evil things that I used to do.</p><p>- You know what? It's okay. God understands that all of us make mistakes, we make wrong choices, and he still loves us even when we sin. - We're going to go get some yoga now. Do you guys want to come with us? - Actually, we have a meeting to go to called Villains Being Secretive, so yeah, we start when we can.</p><p>- Okay. - We'll see you later. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. - Nemesis didn't understand why they were being disobedient and evil, and so he decided, frustratingly, to attend the Villains Being Secretive meeting to ask some help. (audience laughing) - Guys, I don't understand. What are you doing?</p><p>We are supposed to be enemies. En-ne-mies. E-n-n-ie. I enemy. They are enemies. - Wait, why are they our enemies? - Huh. I don't know. - Can you at least just listen to us and hear what we learned at VBS? - No, I don't want to learn anything that you've learned at VBS.</p><p>- Yeah, but it's good for you. Maybe you'll change and you won't be so evil. - Anger management issue? I don't have anger management issue. - Come on. Come on, Nemesis. Okay, fine. I'll listen to what you've learned at this VBS. - All right, so, on day one, in the beginning, or, day one, we learned that God created us to love him.</p><p>So, for me, I was very thankful for Corky's work for showing me that God created me to love him instead of brainwashing them for my evil desires. - Okay. - On day two, we learned that God will still love us even when we make mistakes. I'm sorry that we beat up Cork and Spork, but more importantly, I'm sorry to God.</p><p>Cork and Spork were the ones who shared the gospel with us and helped us see the light. - On day three, we learned that God sent his son to save us. I'm so glad that God sent Jesus to save us from our suffering. I'm so glad that, I know that God sent Cork and Spork to help us understand the gospel.</p><p>- Okay, coffee. - On day four, we learned that God has a plan for Jesus. We learned... - Because we read the Bible, Julie understood how Jesus died for us, so we can wait for his second coming. (audience murmuring) - You're right. I mean, maybe it was full time that I was wrong this whole time.</p><p>Maybe I was evil. I mean, was I bad? What do you guys think? - Well, I mean, if you really do believe that you're evil and you feel sorry for it, well, we'll learn today in BBS on the last day that God sent us, or he promised us, a helper.</p><p>- Wait, I think I've heard about that before. I might have heard you guys talking about that, that God sent a helper called the Holy, the Holy Spatula, I believe, or Sponge? - No, the Holy Spirit. - Oh, the Holy Spirit. - Yeah, all you have to do is repeat and believe.</p><p>- God will forgive you and the Holy Spirit will guide you. - You're right. You know, maybe I do believe. I mean, all right, I guess I do believe. First thing I have to tell you guys, I don't have an evil twin brother. Secondly, I do still have beautiful, nice skin.</p><p>I mean, but you're right, I believe. I am sorry, everybody, for being evil. - Okay, be through with you, but most importantly, God forgives you. - All right, thanks, guys. - I'm through! - Through. - Through. - It all came to an end. But not only did Corcoran sports play the gospel, but nemesis, the most evil nemesis, accepted Christ and was moved by the Holy Spirit to follow God.</p><p>And he came here for us to find out more cooked with the word of slander.
