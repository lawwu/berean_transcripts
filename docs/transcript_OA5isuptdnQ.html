First of all, we want to say happy birthday to our kids who are worshiping with their parents. Cadence Cho is celebrating the birthday. And then Curtis Lee is turning 10. And Amy Lou is turning 15. Eloise Park is turning 3.</p><p>Jude Park is turning 2. Audrey is turning 13. And Hannah is turning 5. So happy birthday to all of you. And so we want to give you some highlights of the announcements before we get started. Praise and prayer, not this coming Friday but the Friday after on August 14th we have praise and prayer at 730.</p><p>It's going to be outside. So hopefully it won't be as hot. But again at 730 and two Fridays we're having it. So our weekday Bible study for the Thessalonians have concluded at least for the smaller groups. And then the Thessalonians study -- sorry, Ephesians study. But the first Thessalonians is going to be starting on the first week of September.</p><p>So we need you guys to sign up as soon as you can so we can divide you up into small groups and home groups as soon as possible. And then we're going to have the first Thessalonians beginning September. So I just want you guys, if you want to be a little bit studious, just get ahead of the game and read first Thessalonians as often as you can and outline it so when we jump in you'll know, you'll kind of have a head start on that.</p><p>So that's going to be on first Thessalonians. And today after our praise time, our brother Sam Cho is going to be baptized. So he's going to be coming up and giving his testimony after the worship time. So for those of you who are at home, again, for those of you who are here, after I pray, we'll give you some time to give the offering electronically.</p><p>If you wanted to give it physically, it's also in the back corner. You can just drop off your check there as well. Let's pray. Gracious and loving father, we thank you for your goodness. We thank you, father God, for being patient with us. We thank you for your living word that teaches us and guides us.</p><p>And even the depth of understanding of what it is that you have done. The more we understand, the more we see your glory, the more we desire to worship you. Lord, you truly are deserving. I pray, father God, that our worship may be pleasing in your sight. That even in our giving, help us to give it to you generously with our hearts filled with joy.</p><p>That it may be multiplied for your use. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. (light piano music) Let's all rise together as we sing just to go through just again, this song is a hymn, "The Solid Rock." As we think about and then reminded about being anchored in Christ, this song is very appropriate.</p><p>And if you do have your phone, the lyrics are on the app. So if you guys can pull that out and follow along. I'm gonna read the verse one chorus. It says, "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.</p><p>And on Christ, the solid rock, I stand. All of the ground is sinking sand. All of the ground is sinking sand. That we, I pray and hope that we sing these lyrics with understanding that Christ is who we anchor to 'cause we're standing on solid ground. (light piano music) (light piano music) My hope is built.</p><p>♪ My hope is built on nothing less ♪ ♪ Than Jesus' blood and righteousness ♪ ♪ I dare not trust the sweetest frame ♪ ♪ But wholly lean on Jesus' name ♪ ♪ On Christ, the solid rock, I stand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ (light guitar music) (light guitar music) ♪ When darkness fails ♪ ♪ When darkness fails his lovely face ♪ ♪ I rest on his unchanging grace ♪ ♪ In every high and stormy gale ♪ ♪ My anchor holds with on Christ ♪ ♪ On Christ, the solid rock, I stand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ (light guitar music) (light guitar music) Singing out his oath, his covenant.</p><p>♪ His oath, his covenant, his blood ♪ ♪ Support me in the whelming flood ♪ ♪ When all around my soul gives way ♪ ♪ That is all my hope and strength ♪ ♪ On Christ, the solid rock, I stand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ (light guitar music) (light guitar music) ♪ When he shall ♪ ♪ When he shall come with trumpet sound ♪ ♪ O may I then in him be found ♪ ♪ Trust in his righteousness alone ♪ ♪ On Christ, the solid rock, I stand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ On Christ, the solid rock, I stand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ ♪ All of the ground is sinking sand ♪ (light guitar music) (upbeat music) ♪ We will fear the battle ♪ ♪ We will fear the night ♪ ♪ We will walk the valley with you by our side ♪ ♪ You will go before us ♪ ♪ You will lead the way ♪ ♪ We have found a refuge only you can see ♪ ♪ Sing with joy now ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ Our Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress ♪ ♪ Raise your voice now ♪ ♪ The love is greater ♪ ♪ Proofs you stand against the sin ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ Even when I stumble ♪ ♪ Even when I stumble ♪ ♪ Even when I fall ♪ ♪ Even when I turn back ♪ ♪ Still your love is strong ♪ ♪ You will not abandon ♪ ♪ You will not forsake ♪ ♪ You will lead me on ♪ ♪ Through the never-ending rain ♪ ♪ Sing with joy now ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress ♪ ♪ Raise your voice now ♪ ♪ The love is greater ♪ ♪ Proofs you stand against the sin ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ We're neither high nor dead ♪ ♪ We're neither high nor dead ♪ ♪ Can separate us ♪ ♪ Hell and death ♪ ♪ Will not defeat us ♪ ♪ He who gave his son to us ♪ ♪ Holds me in his love ♪ ♪ Neither high nor dead ♪ ♪ Can separate us ♪ ♪ Hell and death ♪ ♪ Will not defeat us ♪ ♪ He who gave his son to us ♪ ♪ Holds me in his love ♪ ♪ Sing with joy now ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress ♪ ♪ Raise your voice now ♪ ♪ The love is greater ♪ ♪ Proofs you stand against the sin ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ Sing with joy now ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪ ♪ The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress ♪ ♪ Raise your voice now ♪ ♪ The love is greater ♪ ♪ Proofs you stand against the sin ♪ ♪ Our God is for us ♪  >> Good morning church family.</p><p>My name is Sam. I'm part of the family ministry. This is my wife. You can commonly see her rocking out on the keyboard. I have two daughters. Carol and Cadence who are four and Cadence just turned two. I'm here and excited to share my brief testimony about how I'm being here baptized today.</p><p>I was born into a loving Christian home and just simply thought being a good kid was enough. Everything was good until my junior year of high school when my sister Diane went off to college and life became a bit more lonely and depressing. One weekend Diane came home to visit and she simply asked me do you think you know Christ?</p><p>If you look at Diane she's crying already. I answered with a no and she proceeded to share the gospel with me. This is the moment where I can truly say to myself I started seeking after the Lord. During this time the Lord continually revealed my sins such as selfishness, lust and pride and that my circumstances was caused because of my total depravity.</p><p>I recognize that my wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. I also realized that I needed to make Christ my Lord and I wanted to pursue to be obedient to him. Around late high school I accepted Christ as Lord over my life.</p><p>Life as a believer has been different with each life stage. In my early college years my sins were very clear. It was constant struggles with lust and girls. It was a struggle with career and money. Now in my early 30s my sins are more subtle and harder to pinpoint.</p><p>A recent sin I have been wrestling with is making my kids a top priority. It's been a huge struggle as a father to give what I think is best for my kids as opposed to discovering God's will and prayerfully deciding. I have decided to make Christ my Lord and life is not about me or my kids but more so about how can I die to myself each and every day.</p><p>God's word in Galatians says I have been crucified with Christ and it's not I who lives but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me. I was infant baptized and confirmed in college through the Presbyterian church and after my own personal studies on baptism and rejecting the idea of infant baptism I thought to myself what is the point of getting baptized now?</p><p>After navigating through my own heart the answer is simple. It's because Christ is my Lord and I want to be obedient to him. I want to be obedient to him and get baptized as I possibly can. I want to be obedient in every possible way I can and this means getting baptized, not confirmed.</p><p>I am here with my shortcomings as a sinner and through this baptism I will be uniting with Christ in his death and resurrection which by confirmation I was not able to do. For that I am excited for this moment. I am excited to navigate through life being sanctified and surrendering all to him.</p><p>Today marks my baptism and my daughter's second birthday. I am excited to be baptized by Pastor Peter who has shepherded me and yesterday I found out that James is going to be part of it as well. I joke about letting James marry my sister but in all seriousness, James has been a huge mentor, a brother that helped me grow in so many ways.</p><p>Not just me but I know so many other brothers feel the same way. For that I am excited and I thank everyone for this time. >> You understand when you go into the water you are uniting with Christ in his death and when you come out you are uniting with his resurrected life.</p><p>I am excited to be baptized by Pastor Peter.

The debt that is so thick, there is no way to get out of it other than to entertain what is bankruptcy.</p><p>How do I get out of this? You see, the law came to reveal, to bring us to the point, to bring us to repentance so we don't come before God and say I did bad but I will do better the second time. If you give me another chance, I will get it right the second time.</p><p>That's not repentance. True repentance is coming before God and recognizing the debt is too big. There is just no way. That's why in Luke 18 when Jesus describes true repentance, he first describes a Pharisee who completely missed the mark. A Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself. God, I thank you that I am not like other people.</p><p>You see where his pride comes from? He wasn't looking at God. He was looking at other people. And that's where pride comes from. Typically when they compare their sins with other people, they say I am not like those other people, swindlers, adulterers, tax collectors. I fast twice a week and pay tithe of all that I get.</p><p>Sometimes the people who are the most faithful at church are the hardest people to get to with the gospel. Because they have allowed their self-righteousness to be their righteousness subconsciously. And as a result of that, the gospel doesn't penetrate. They are never humbled. They are always frustrated with the sins of other people.</p><p>But the tax collector in verse 13 says standing some distance away was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven but was beating his breast saying God be merciful to me the sinner. Now humanly speaking, the Pharisee was a good man. Humanly speaking. He was getting tithes. He was praying.</p><p>He was making disciples. He was trying hard to obey God's law. This tax collector was cheating his people. He was making other people's lives difficult. He did this superficially and said the tax collector was the one justified before God and the Pharisee was the bad guy. You Pharisee. That's one of the worst things you can call a Christian.</p><p>You Pharisee. Think of it from a human perspective. He is the upright moral man who is concerned about his brothers. And he is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.</p><p>He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.</p><p>He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God. You have to recognize that all of those sins that you committed of the previous generation, all of your forefathers, all of the kings, all of the warnings of the prophets, that you are under that condemnation. When Paul says in the book of Romans, the wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness, he is talking about you.</p><p>He is talking first and foremost about the Jews. You were guilty of a life sentence and you were sentenced to die in prison and somebody came along and said, you know what, I took your place. You are free to go. That in and of itself, you would think that person would live outside in freedom even if he struggles financially.</p><p>Even if he is out on the street, that he would live the rest of his life always thinking about the guy who took my place. Always thankful. Always grateful for what he has done. The gospel doesn't stop there. He says he not only died to forgive the sins of those people in the old testament, old covenant, he says number two, Jesus died to give those redeemed the promised eternal inheritance.</p><p>Again, it's like I am in truth. I know you understand it here but let that sink in. He didn't just give them freedom. He said he gave his inheritance. Look what he said in verse 15b. Those who have been called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance. The promise of eternal inheritance.</p><p>He didn't just release them from the obligation of the penalty of sin. He elevated them and kept his promise of inheritance. What is his inheritance promise? Genesis 12. Now the Lord said to Abram, go forth from your country and from your father's house to the land which I will show you and I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and I will make your name great.</p><p>You shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I will curse and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. He made a unilateral covenant with the nation of Israel and he doesn't say if you do this, I will do this.</p><p>He says I will do this. Keep that in mind. You need to keep that in mind to understand what he is saying in verse 16. Look at verse 16. Again, if you are not thinking critically and you are already half asleep, might as well keep sleeping because this part requires your attention.</p><p>Verse 16. For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. Think about that. What does that mean? The one who made the covenant has to die in order for the covenant to be effective. What covenant do you know where that is the place?</p><p>What does he mean by that? Who needs to die? For a covenant is valid only when men are dead. That doesn't make any sense. Covenant is only good when we are living. When we die the covenant is gone. If the husband and wife -- even in the marriage covenant if the husband and wife are dead, the covenant is only good if the other dies.</p><p>Do you read that? If you are not confused, you haven't been paying attention. You should be confused. You feel like I don't get this. Then you are paying attention. Those of you sitting there thinking that makes perfect sense, you need to wake up. You are not following. If you are paying attention, what does that mean?</p><p>The covenant is only good when men are dead. The covenant is only good when men are dead. The covenant is only good when men are dead.
