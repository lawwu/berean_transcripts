href="https://www.vimeo.com/161069464#t=607s">00:10:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And because he had a heart attack, he ended up in the hospital and he was there for about</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/161069464#t=623s">00:10:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So by the time he was released in the hospital, he had to start this process over.</span></div><div
