So the question that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=13s">00:00:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I ask is, "Describe the promise of hope given to Israel through the roots of Jesse in verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=17s">00:00:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 5." So what I would like you to do is, because you have three weeks, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=23s">00:00:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">need to do Thursday just Thursday.

And if you look at the second question, it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=34s">00:00:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"Name specific things that you remember in the life and person of Jesus that fulfills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=39s">00:00:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">these promises specifically." So if you took time and actually went through this, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=44s">00:00:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">probably find about 10 to 15 things that are actually fulfilled in Christ.

Yes, he was peaceful. You know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=53s">00:00:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean? Like Jesus came and he didn't go to war. You can do that off the top of your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=58s">00:00:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Or what I really encourage you to do is take the opportunity that you have as we are headed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=63s">00:01:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">toward Christmas and preparing for the Christmas day and to get your heart ready. I know some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=68s">00:01:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of you moms have been copying the Advent texts every day. But what I really want you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=75s">00:01:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is take that opportunity from now until Christmas and really meditate on, in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=81s">00:01:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this text, chapter 11, and go through each detail. So give me an example. "There shall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=87s">00:01:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">come forth shoot from the stump of Jesse, the branch from his roots shall bear fruit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=91s">00:01:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, so in what way did he come? Okay, take some time to look through the genealogy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=98s">00:01:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of Matthew chapter 1 and what are some highlights. "And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=103s">00:01:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding." So in what part of Jesus' life do you recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=110s">00:01:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that in the Gospels, right? Where was it clearly evident of his wisdom? Where was it clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=116s">00:01:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">evident of the Spirit being upon him that he was a great counselor? Knowledge and fear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=122s">00:02:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Lord was upon him. Where is that fulfilled in Jesus' life? "His light shall be in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=127s">00:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes sees." So in other words, that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=131s">00:02:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't just consider what was right and wrong based upon what everybody else saw, he saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=135s">00:02:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond that, right? So where are these examples? So some of you guys, or a lot of you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=140s">00:02:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">may know just off the top of your head and say, you could probably think of an example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=145s">00:02:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and you say, "Oh, he did this, and this is an example." But what I want you guys to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=149s">00:02:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is take time to comb through the Gospels and see how much of this you can find in the New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=155s">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament. Do you get my question? Okay? Now if I ask you to do this on a normal week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=160s">00:02:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously that would be way too much for you to do, but because this is really three weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=165s">00:02:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You can take a whole week just doing this, right? So you don't have to follow Thursday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=171s">00:02:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Friday, Saturday, I just labeled it like that, but I really want you guys to take some time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=175s">00:02:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to really wrestle through Chapter 11. So even if it takes you a week and a half to two weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=179s">00:02:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">just to do Chapter 11. But by the time you get to Chapter 12, Chapter 12, 13, will go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=186s">00:03:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by pretty quick. More Chapter 13. So by the time you get to Tuesday, Wednesday, those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=193s">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">questions are a lot like the other questions that you have. It's pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=198s">00:03:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you read it and you put some thought into it, you can answer it pretty quick. But Chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=203s">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">11 and Chapter 12 require some meditation. Okay? You get it? Okay. So, again, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=211s">00:03:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to say it again. The memory verse, please jot it down if you don't have it, the memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=215s">00:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">verse for the next three weeks is Isaiah Chapter 11, verses 1 through 5. Okay? So I made it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=221s">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">short on purpose. Because it's three weeks worth. It should have been like six verses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=227s">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but I gave you five. So you're welcome. Okay? Yeah. So just, I think, you know, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=236s">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it just kind of, I didn't plan that way. It's like, oh, we're going to land on Chapter 11</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=239s">00:03:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when we take Christmas break. But God sovereignly planned it that way, right? We believe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=243s">00:04:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">predestination. So it's been predestined. So take some time to do that. Okay? All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=252s">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">All the papers have been handed out. So if you didn't get one to fill out, just raise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=257s">00:04:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your hand and there's plenty left over on the tables. And then if you ask for an electronic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">copy and you didn't get one, that means for whatever reason, I didn't, you're not on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=269s">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">list. So you need to ask, you need to tell me. Okay? Did you ask? Okay. Anyway, whoever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=277s">00:04:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">asked and you didn't get it, let me know. When I'm done with the teaching, I'll go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=281s">00:04:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll add you and I'll send it to you. Okay. All right. So we're in Chapter 9 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=289s">00:04:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">11. All right, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening. We thank you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=303s">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord God, for your graciousness. We thank you, Lord God, for your love that sustains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=309s">00:05:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and guides us that despite our shortcomings, we thank you that you motivate us and inspire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=316s">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us by your humility, by your grace.

And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=351s">00:05:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for that end, we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. All right. So we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=358s">00:05:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at Chapter 10, 9 and 10. And not all the chapters break out in this kind of neat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=363s">00:06:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">order, but Chapter 9 and 10 happens to work out that way. All right. Can you check in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=393s">00:06:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and take that out and put that back in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=394s">00:06:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

That's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=474s">00:07:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. Okay. Hey, you know what? I forgot. Did you guys check up on your memory? All</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=494s">00:08:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right. You're going to have to do that at the end. All right. When you guys get together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=499s">00:08:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in your group, you guys can check up on your memory. All right. So Matthew 10, 28, Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=506s">00:08:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=510s">00:08:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." And this probably summarizes verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=516s">00:08:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 9 and 10, where Chapter 9 is again, a judgment upon the nation of Israel, even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=523s">00:08:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">though the beginning of it, we talk about his promise of the coming Messiah. But Chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=529s">00:08:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">9, after that, it pretty much to Chapter 10, verse 4, is judgment coming upon the nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=534s">00:08:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of Israel.

In the end, the judgment that came,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=539s">00:08:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the Assyrians came and they conquered you.

God, right? It's not the Assyrians that you should fear. You should fear God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=550s">00:09:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Chapter 10 talks about to the Assyrians, how even though they conquered, ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=555s">00:09:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment is coming upon them because they didn't recognize who the real God was. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=560s">00:09:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the end, I think Chapter 10, 28, Matthew 10, 28, pretty much summarizes what the teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=566s">00:09:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's about to teach in Chapter 9 and 10. Okay. So again, just like last week, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=571s">00:09:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go down the questions and some of the questions are going to be obviously pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=575s">00:09:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">easy. Some of them I'm going to spend a little bit more time. The first one is, "What change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=580s">00:09:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from their present condition does Isaiah predict in 9, 1, and 2?" And so again, if you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=586s">00:09:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at it, Chapter 9, "But there will be no gloom for who was in anguish in the former time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=592s">00:09:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the latter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=596s">00:09:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time he has made glorious the way of the sea and land beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=601s">00:10:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=605s">00:10:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">deep darkness on them has light shine." So if you look at it, the territories that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=611s">00:10:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned Zebulun and Naphtali was the starting point of a serious conquest of Israel. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=617s">00:10:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in other words, he's saying that these lands that were conquered, right, in former time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=626s">00:10:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun, but in latter time he made it glorious. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=630s">00:10:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he's going to turn it around, right? So he's about to introduce the solution to their problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=637s">00:10:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So "Though Israel has experienced gloom and anguish, God will defeat their enemies and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=641s">00:10:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">turn gloom into joy, darkness will turn into great light." So he's, again, he's setting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=645s">00:10:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it up for the coming of the Messiah. "So in what ways is the coming of the kingdom of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=655s">00:10:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">justice and righteousness mentioned in 9.7?" So again, you know, the whole point of all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=661s">00:11:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of this is he's bringing relief, right, for the judgment that came upon the nation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=667s">00:11:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel. That the poor and the helpless, they were widowed, and again, because it was institutional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=673s">00:11:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">oppression, when the Messiah comes, he says the government is going to be ruling, God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=678s">00:11:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be ruling in fairness and justice and righteousness, right? So again, you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=688s">00:11:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about the Messiah, the Messiah's going to come and he's going to not only affect individually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=693s">00:11:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but he's going to affect the society, right? So God's solution to a violent nation's conquest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=700s">00:11:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is not greater army. So he's saying, is it hard to see? There's nothing I can do about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=710s">00:11:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it now. Can you, are you going to? Huh? If you change the background to like white? No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=721s">00:12:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no, then the text will turn, because there's no color in the text, it'll just turn to black,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=729s">00:12:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. Really, you can't see? No, but you can't see? You can see it? Sang, can you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=742s">00:12:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it? No. Actually, that's a young, fresh group on this side. Can you guys see it? Oh, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=752s">00:12:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">can't see it either? Okay. Just switch the background to white or beige. All right, I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=759s">00:12:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">never use that again. I used black before, you guys had no problem. Black was okay, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=765s">00:12:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">blue and red is no good? Okay. Note to self. Is that better? Did you just turn it black</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=774s">00:12:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or did you turn it white? Okay. All right. So that's better. Yeah? Okay, very good. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=796s">00:13:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what I want you to notice is, God basically tells the nation of Israel that a superpower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=802s">00:13:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">has come and they destroyed you, and here are the cities, and at one point they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=805s">00:13:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">destroyed, but God's going to turn it into joy, and then all of this is a setup for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=810s">00:13:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Messiah is going to come. Messiah is going to come and do this, right? He says His name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=815s">00:13:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=820s">00:13:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Peace. Now, what's unique about this is that obviously, you know, oftentimes names in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=826s">00:13:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible are used to kind of characterize what God's going to do, or it would say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=833s">00:13:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">God will save, God will provide, and so God's name is in a lot of people's names. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=838s">00:13:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">title that is given to the Messiah that's coming is not just about God is going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=843s">00:14:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and do this, or God's going to judge, or God's going to deliver. It actually is just a name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=848s">00:14:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of God. Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. So obviously, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=855s">00:14:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">know, us in the covenant on this side, we look at this, and this is not just a title</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=859s">00:14:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jesus. This is Jesus. This is who He is, right? And part of the reason why we believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=864s">00:14:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that He's the second person of the Trinity. This title cannot be given to just anybody,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=871s">00:14:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so the hope that He's going to bring to the Messiah is not freedom. He doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=877s">00:14:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">simply say that here's the oppressor, He came and He's ruling over you. He said, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=882s">00:14:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Messiah is going to come, and He's going to rule over you, right? So the answer to oppression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=889s">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is not another king that's going to conquer, I mean, is going to come and conquer, get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=893s">00:14:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rid of them, and so you can be free to do whatever you want, right? He says the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=898s">00:14:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to the oppressor is to bring a good king. Not no king, but a good king, right? And that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=906s">00:15:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">again, oftentimes as Christians, what we miss, you know, concerning our sanctification, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=911s">00:15:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">second aspect about our salvation is not, we're not just freed from sin. What does the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=917s">00:15:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible say? We're freed from sin. We were once slaves of sin, and we've been freed from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=922s">00:15:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and now we're slaves of what? Slaves of righteousness. So we were once under the dominion of darkness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=929s">00:15:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">now we're under the dominion of the light.

So the answer to the oppression isn't freedom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=941s">00:15:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to do whatever you want. It is to be, to have a ruler that is good and just, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=949s">00:15:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's how the Messiah is described for us. Why is the judgment coming upon the nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=957s">00:15:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of Israel? So from this point on, basically God is describing to Israel, here's what has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=964s">00:16:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">happened.

How would you describe the first section, verses 8 through 12? Now how do we know there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=984s">00:16:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">four separate ones? At the end of each one of these four, how does it end? Okay, so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=998s">00:16:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you've read it through, you should have noticed that that phrase is repeated at the end of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1003s">00:16:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">every one of these judgments, right?

And instead of humbling them, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1331s">00:22:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">become proud and say, "No, we're going to do it right this time." Right? But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1336s">00:22:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of Assyria, who else is coming? Well, that's later, in the text. Look in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1344s">00:22:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the text. Okay?

So, not only Assyria, but the other smaller nations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1368s">00:22:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

In other words, God is saying, remember how it ends? Right? For this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1379s">00:22:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for all this, His anger has not turned away, and His hand is stretched out still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1384s">00:23:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, judgment is, the period of judgment is not over.

And in the end, who's doing all of this? What's God's point? Who's doing all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1436s">00:23:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of this? God. Right?

Right? Remember how they first responded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1453s">00:24:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when judgment started coming, when the other nations started coming? Remember in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1457s">00:24:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the very beginning of Isaiah? How did they initially respond? Yes? But think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1464s">00:24:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about the text. Think about the text that we're looking at in Chapter 1, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1467s">00:24:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning. Remember? Look at Chapter 1. You only have to flip three pages, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1476s">00:24:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens? What was their response to the initial judgment that came? What is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1485s">00:24:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he angry about? I hate superficial religion, like activity at the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1497s">00:24:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, what is all of that to me? So the initial response was, hey, maybe go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1502s">00:25:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to the temple and offer sacrifices and give prayer, and he says, what is all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1506s">00:25:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that to me when your heart is still filthy and dirty? Right? Your prayers are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1510s">00:25:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">meaningless, because what he wants is repentance. Right? You don't repent, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1516s">00:25:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you do more religious activity. All it does is anger God even further. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1521s">00:25:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that was their initial response, and so one of the things that they did is, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1525s">00:25:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">be more religious. And that's part of that pride. We're going to do it right this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1528s">00:25:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time.

And part of the reason why he's not done with his judgment is because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1543s">00:25:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't lead you to where God wanted you to go, which is to be broken and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1547s">00:25:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize that God is God. Right? Again, we talked about that, right? And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1556s">00:25:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the theme of basically Chapter 10.

It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1560s">00:26:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like he's not just poking.

Just as his grace and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1565s">00:26:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy is thorough, so is his judgment. The purpose of judgment wasn't just slap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1570s">00:26:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on the hand. Right? The rebellion of Israel was so deep, and their hearts were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1577s">00:26:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so hardened, that God had to come and hit them over and over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1582s">00:26:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that's how hardened they were. So when the judgment first came, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1587s">00:26:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't even see it as judgment. They said, maybe if we strategize. Maybe if we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1591s">00:26:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, connect it with Assyria or Egypt or whatever. And they were trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1595s">00:26:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">strategize, using every resource that they had to think that if they were just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1599s">00:26:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">smart enough, we can get out of this. And they went to religiousness. They aligned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1603s">00:26:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves with other people. They got, you know, they tried to establish the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1607s">00:26:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right leaders. And none of that works. Right? Because in the end, the point that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1611s">00:26:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God's trying to make is, you don't recognize that I'm the one. Until you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1615s">00:26:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">come before me, humble yourself, and repent. Right? God's judgment will be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1619s">00:26:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">will remain. Chapter 11, he transitions now, not only is Israel wrong, now the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1631s">00:27:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyrians are now getting arrogant. Right? Not recognizing that God is allowing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1637s">00:27:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them to become a power. And how does God describe the Assyrians? As is what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1647s">00:27:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">As a tool. It's just an axe that God is wielding to do his work. But the tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1653s">00:27:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">begins to think, right? That they're sovereign. Say, hey, we conquered Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1659s">00:27:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're more powerful than your God. So, basically what God is saying to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1663s">00:27:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">nation of Israel is, God's going to humble you. And you see that the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1667s">00:27:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why you were powerful is because God was using you as an axe. Right? Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1671s">00:27:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God's going to turn his anger toward you. Right? So again, the wrath of God is now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1677s">00:27:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">directed to Assyrians, who became proud that they were above God of Israel since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1681s">00:28:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they conquered them. Right? Not realizing, right, that God is not done with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1689s">00:28:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel. God still favors Israel over Assyria. But even though there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1695s">00:28:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment upon them, God uses Assyria to bring judgment. Right? But that's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1700s">00:28:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">his child. It's kind of like, you know, if I took my kid to daycare or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1706s">00:28:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and he's acting up and I tell the teacher, I say, "Hey, spank him if he gets out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1710s">00:28:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">line." And the teacher starts to spank him. He's like, "Dude, this is fun." You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1714s">00:28:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">know what I mean? And he goes out of line and he starts spanking him and spanking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1718s">00:28:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">him. You know what I mean? He said, "Well, I told you not to do this." And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1721s">00:28:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the dad shows up. He's like, "What are you doing?" Right? He said, "You told me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1726s">00:28:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to spank him." He said, "No, to discipline him. What you're doing is beating him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1730s">00:28:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">up. Now you're abusing him." Right? And so basically that's the picture here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1734s">00:28:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyria comes in, spanking a nation of Israel, not recognizing it's because God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1739s">00:28:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is allowing him to do that. And then these guys start becoming arrogant, thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1743s">00:29:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Now these guys are all under me." And then he starts abusing them. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1746s">00:29:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">father shows up. He's like, "No." Right? "Now you're going to be judged." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1751s">00:29:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that's chapter 11, or chapter 10. Two conclusions are given through this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1756s">00:29:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">passage. The judgment God allowed to the Assyrians was temporary. It wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1761s">00:29:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">permanent. Right? God wasn't done with the nation of Israel. And that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1766s">00:29:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he's trying to, he's going to remind Assyria, "Those are still my people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1769s">00:29:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though, because of their sin, they're being disciplined. Right? Assyria</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1774s">00:29:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was not operating independently of God's sovereign plan. They were serving God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1778s">00:29:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimate purpose. Right? So again, if you read 5 and 6, it says, "Ah, Assyria, the rod of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1787s">00:29:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">anger, the staff in their hands is my fury. Against godless nation I send him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1792s">00:29:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and against the people of my wrath I command him to take spoil and seize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1795s">00:29:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the street." In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1798s">00:29:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that you were able to do is because I allowed you. Right? But he does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1804s">00:30:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not so intend, and his heart does not so think, but it is in his heart to destroy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1808s">00:30:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and to cut off nations, not a few. In other words, God allowed you to do this, but now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1813s">00:30:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're getting carried away. You're being abusive with your power. Right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1816s">00:30:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what he's saying. So what would God do? What is the judgment that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1824s">00:30:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to bring to the nation of Israel, or Assyria? Again, the first four cities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1830s">00:30:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know how we talked about the beginning of the judgment upon Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1834s">00:30:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mentions the cities. The beginning of the judgment upon Assyria mentions the cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1838s">00:30:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the cities, 9 were mentioned in verse 9, were all fortresses, cities in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1844s">00:30:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the northwestern Syria, the outpost of Damascus. These cities were trophies of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1849s">00:30:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">boast for the king of Assyria. Okay, that's why all the cities are mentioned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1853s">00:30:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And God says, "God will humble the arrogance of Syria, Syria's king, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1859s">00:30:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wipe out the pride look in their eyes." Okay, and God's going to humble you now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1870s">00:31:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In what way was he deluded in his conquest of Judah? So all of these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1878s">00:31:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 13 to 15, let's look at that. He said, "For he says, 'By the strength of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1885s">00:31:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hand I have done it.'" In other words, this is Assyria talking about himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1889s">00:31:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The nation is saying, or the king, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1894s">00:31:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and by my wisdom I have understanding. I remove the boundaries of peoples and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1898s">00:31:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">plunder their treasures. Like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1903s">00:31:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples, and as one gathers eggs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1909s">00:31:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that have been forsaken. So I have gathered all the earth, and there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1912s">00:31:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">none that moved a wing, or opened a mouth, or chirped." Right? So, again, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1917s">00:31:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a description of Assyria. Because he experiences all the success, basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1921s">00:32:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he's saying, "I did this. I can move boundaries. I can get these people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1925s">00:32:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I can basically do whatever I want." Right? And so, therefore, God comes and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1929s">00:32:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">says he's going to humble them. So, again, we see parallels even in the New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1935s">00:32:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament. The temptation is when, you know, the temptation for the nation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1941s">00:32:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Israel was even when they were being judged, not recognizing that God's hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1946s">00:32:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is upon the judgment. Right? And then the way that he tries to get out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1950s">00:32:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment is by working harder, being smarter. Right? And so, in that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1955s">00:32:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're being judged even more because God's not done. So, because my discipline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1959s">00:32:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't working, you're not submitting, so more judgment is coming. Assyria,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1963s">00:32:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment is coming for the exact opposite reason. They enjoy all this success,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1968s">00:32:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not recognizing your success is because God was behind you. Right? So, you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1973s">00:32:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the opposite? And the same thing with us. Right? When we don't succeed in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1979s">00:32:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">something, I mean, we have a tendency to be humble, but a lot of times, what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1984s">00:33:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that happen? You know, what happens? We're going to work harder. You know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1989s">00:33:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to make some adjustments. We're going to be wiser. We're going to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1992s">00:33:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, seek better counsel. And we do everything except humble ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=1997s">00:33:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">before God. And as a result of that, more judgment comes. Or, you're very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2003s">00:33:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">successful at something. Right? And I think that can happen, like, I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2007s">00:33:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the arrogance of man, which is every time, and this could be true as a church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2013s">00:33:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be true as an individual.

I think sometimes success</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2059s">00:34:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">has more damage, has more damaging effect than even when we fail.

And what did we do wrong the first eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2219s">00:36:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">years? Right? If there's anything, I think what God was doing for the first eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2224s">00:37:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">years is to teach one thing. It ain't you. Right? It ain't you. And if God's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2232s">00:37:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bless anything, He's going to bless something, bless people, bless ministries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2236s">00:37:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and bless families.

Because ultimately, the best place for a church and individual to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2245s">00:37:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is to be humbled and recognize that we're just instruments. Right? I'm just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2250s">00:37:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mouthpiece. Right?

As much as they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2531s">00:42:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">scaring Christians and people out, the modern Muslims are tired of it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2535s">00:42:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're stepping out. But there aren't enough churches out there receiving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2539s">00:42:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them." So he was basically saying, "We need Christians to step up." And so even in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2544s">00:42:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">midst of that, I think a practical application is that there is a, no matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2548s">00:42:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how fearsome and no matter how much terror they try to put in, that in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2552s">00:42:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">end, the same thing God's telling these people. Right? It's not the Assyrians that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2556s">00:42:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to fear. It's interesting that it's coming out of the same area. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2560s">00:42:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the Assyrians. It's not Syrians. It's not ISIS that you need to fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2565s">00:42:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's God behind them. Right? When the king of Assyria made his way near</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2573s">00:42:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Jerusalem, he said, "They're going to come in arrogance." So all the cities that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2577s">00:42:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mentions, right? You know how he just kind of lists off one city after city?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2582s">00:43:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, that's the path to come to Jerusalem. So in other words, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2586s">00:43:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyrians and their arrogance are coming and conquering city after city after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2589s">00:43:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">city. But what does this say? But when they come, right, God's going to stop them at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2595s">00:43:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their tracks in verse 32. Right? No matter how many cities they conquer, it's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2601s">00:43:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 32, this very day he will halt at Nob. Right? When God says stop, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2607s">00:43:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to stop. Because you're not going to touch my people. Right? The only way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2614s">00:43:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he's going to allow them to be touched is if God says yes. Right? If God says yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2620s">00:43:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a purpose behind this. But as long as God says these are my people, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2626s">00:43:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyrians have no power. So they may have come and marched all their way up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2631s">00:43:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their point, but right before they get to Jerusalem, basically God says you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2634s">00:43:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to stop right here at Nob. Right? And that's what he's saying. Verse 32,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2639s">00:43:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"This very day he will halt at Nob.

In other words, in anger, because he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2647s">00:44:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't conquer it. Right? That's exactly what happens later on. They come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2652s">00:44:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">marching all the way to Jerusalem, and they can't get past the wall. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2657s">00:44:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"Behold, the Lord God hosts will lop the bows with terrifying power.

And so he mentions the majestic ones can come. So the answer isn't another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2677s">00:44:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">great nation. Right? He says the answer to all of this is the one. Right? The one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2684s">00:44:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming. That's interesting that he would say here's the Assyrians. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2690s">00:44:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're probably just as terrifying or more terrifying than when you see these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2694s">00:44:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ISIS people are afraid to go to the Middle East and all that. So these guys are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2698s">00:44:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually coming to you by army.

We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2704s">00:45:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">have our government and all that. But these Assyrians are coming, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2707s">00:45:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what they're beheading people. They're putting their enemies that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2710s">00:45:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they've conquered on sticks, and they're making their children watch their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2713s">00:45:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">parents crucified. That's what the Assyrians did. That's why the people at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2718s">00:45:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that time hated the Assyrians, because they were so brutal. Right? And all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2722s">00:45:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that was done to bring terror upon their enemies. So when they come, they would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2727s">00:45:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so frightened they wouldn't even fight. That's what the Assyrians were known for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2730s">00:45:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at that time. Right? So he's saying that, no, if they're going to come right up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2734s">00:45:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there, and when God says no, it's going to stop. And the answer to that, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2738s">00:45:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't say, "These mighty angels are going to come from heaven." He says, "No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2742s">00:45:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The sign that I'm going to give you, that God's going to deliver you from this, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/149246257#t=2746s">00:45:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Emmanuel.
