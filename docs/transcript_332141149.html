I'm Dean, I'm in the Family Ministry and I lead the Welcome Team. I wanted to just tell you a little bit about the Welcome Team and find out if you might have a heart to serve in this ministry. Welcome Team, we're the ones that you see with the blue lanyards, greeting people when they first come for worship service or ushering people to their seats. You don't need to be an extrovert to be a part of Welcome Team, you just need a heart to really show hospitality and love people. Actually, we'd love to have newer members as well because you have a closer perspective to what it was like to be new to our church and as the church is growing in numbers and in other ways, it'd be helpful to have you on the team as you understand what someone who's new might be seeing and what some of the questions are that they might have. So, definitely can tell you more about Welcome Team. Please contact me or one of the members of the Welcome Team if you'd like more information and if you'd like to serve, we'd like for you to prayerfully consider it and again, please get in touch with us. Thank you. Clean Up Crew is a simple way for us to love our brothers and sisters here at Brien and the Lord by keeping this house of worship clean and almost anybody can do it. What we do is we meet after second service, we sweep up the sanctuary and clean the bathrooms. It's a quick job, around 20 to 30 minutes and just a one month commitment. If you're interested in signing up, you can contact Brien Pomonikin and he'll get you hooked up. Hi, my name is Victoria and I just wanted to say how thankful I am for Parking Ministry, just the opportunity to serve with so many, their brothers and sisters, just being able to greet and just helping just direct flow of traffic in the different lots and everything like that. Just personally, I feel like anyone can do it, so you don't need any special talent or skills or any gifts or anything like that. Just if you have a willing heart to serve and just be able to, yeah, just encourage those and just greet everyone who's coming to church, whether they're newcomers or members of the church, it's just a great way to just greet everyone in the morning. Hope you're able to sign up. We encourage a month long commitment, but just whatever days you're able to do, we'd love to have you there, so thank you. Hi, my name is Mitchell Kim. My wife, Grace, and I are in charge of Snack Team. Snack Team is a ministry that uses one of God's great gifts, food, to help facilitate fellowship in the church body after service. Volunteers sign up for one month out of the year to help prepare and serve snacks. So it's a fairly unintimidating way to be involved in ministry at church. No prior cooking experience is needed, just the heart that wants to serve the church body. If you would like to sign up or find out more information about Snack Team, you can contact either myself or my wife through Facebook, email, or text. We look forward to serving with you, thank you.
