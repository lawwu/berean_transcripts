Let me read that again for you all and follow along with me. Start from verse 15, chapter 5 of Ephesians. Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time because the days are evil.</p><p>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the word of the Lord is. And so remember if you were here from the first session, taking those two verses, I talked about walking by the word, which is the wisdom of the mind. And again, we talk about wisdom. It's not just knowing or having information, but the purpose of that wisdom, the purpose of the word is for your transformation.</p><p>And then verse 18 says this, do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be what filled with the spirit and in our second session together, I talked about walking with the spirit, which is the wisdom of life, the wisdom of life, that the spirit of God empowers us.</p><p>The spirit of God is the presence of God in our lives as he dwells in us. That's that empowers us to live out the Christian life through what the word has implanted in you and I. And then this morning looking at verse 19 to 21 addressing one another in Psalms and hands and spiritual songs, singing and making memory to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always for everything to God, the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>And in verse 21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ, out of reverence for Christ. So this morning, take it from revision chapter five versus specifically verse 20 to 21. What I want to share with you is this walking love, walking love, which is the wisdom of the heart or the wisdom of the soul, right?</p><p>Walking love and giving thanks as Paul mentions here, it says, always give thanks, give me thanks always. And it's not always easy to give thanks. It really isn't. By giving thanks to God for everything is evidence of faith in trusting God. There's a little too much echo. If you lower the volume a little bit down, so we don't want that echo cracking.</p><p>Great, thank you. And so giving thanks to God for everything is the evidence of faith in trusting God and trusting in not in circumstances or your situation, but trusting in his goodness, in his character, in his wisdom, trusting in God who does not change by the shadow of day, right?</p><p>Let's be honest here. You and I are pretty flaky. We are, you know, Peter and I were talking about this and coming up and we're just, you know, there's things that ministers and pastors talk and share. We have what we call common suffering. Okay. There's common things we go through and suffer.</p><p>And it is absolutely true that one of the biggest disappointment for a pastor to have is to trust people because people are flaky. People are not always faithful. Some people are backstabbers, right? Some people are gossipers. Some people are just plain, simply dumb. Dumb, dumb. You know, one of my favorite movie characters is John Wayne, right?</p><p>And he has the most, the best quote, the best quote that I love. And he says, "Life is hard, but it's harder if you're stupid." Okay. Amen. It's true. Life is hard. And you know what I'm talking about, right? I've been stupid many times. I'm sure you've been stupid many times.</p><p>Right? That's why the Bible doesn't call us, you know, lions, horses, or eagles, go eagles, right? But the Bible calls us sheep. Sheep. Because sheep are dumb. Sheep are stupid. They're so weak. They're so finicky. They're so cowardly. They're, they're, they're, they're so pitiful animals. Pitiful. I mean, that's how God looks at us, right?</p><p>Like we like to look at ourselves like, you know, like the eagle or the tiger, okay? Or the bear. Or the anteater. I'm just kidding. But God looks at us as man. Sheep. Sheep. And I've learned in my life too, and the thing about it, it's, it's, it's for me, I personally, I have this, it's a, it's a blessing and it's a shortcoming, right?</p><p>Is this, I'm super loyal. Like I am loyal. Like, like if you're my friend, I am your friend to the end. I am like really loyal. And when, when, when I come across people and I put trust in people and I did that, and that loyal to me, I get devastated, devastated.</p><p>Some of you are like that, right? No, no. I've never hurt people. That's how people, you know, you know, I'm not a killer. I'm a lover, right? Okay. But you know, you, when you, when you trust your circumstances, when you trust in people who are so flaky and finicky, right?</p><p>You can get disappointed. That's why, you know, we can be faithful no matter what circumstances, situation we're in, because you ought to be, we trust in God. We need to trust in God and trust in him and him alone. And so giving thanks to God for everything, right? It's ultimately is trusting in his goodness and his character and his wisdom.</p><p>And so Paul goes out to say here, right? That giving thanks always for everything to God, the father, God, the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. He says in verse 21, submitting to one another out of reverence or out of what? Love for God. Now, hold on.</p><p>I said, this sounds like contradictory. Okay. Why would you want to submit to other people when you can't trust people? Right? I just share with you how flaky you are, right? How unfaithful we, we are all in many ways in our lives. And so why would Paul then here tell us to submit to one another when you can't trust one another?</p><p>Because what Paul is trying to say is this, that ultimately our trust is not in people, but our trust is in who? In Christ. And that God is sovereign. God has control in every person in this world. And think about it. How many billions of people we have in the world now?</p><p>I think last time I counted, it was like almost over 7 billion, right? Close to 7 billion. That's so crazy thinking because 20 years ago, it was about 5 or 6 billion. Too many people in the world, right? But the point is that just think about all the intricacies and individuals from, you know, whether they're in China or they're from Korea or they live in the US or, you know, they live in Seattle or LA, whatever.</p><p>That God is in absolute control of every individual. That's mind-blogging to me. It's like, wow. Wow. Wow. Remember, I don't know if anybody is an X-Men fan. X-Men? There was a doctor, no, no, was it a professor? Xavier. Xavier, right? And he has this little chamber. He goes in, he puts this little thing on, and he's able to see all the what?</p><p>Mutants. Okay? All right? That's a sad example to give actually. God doesn't just see the mutants. He sees the people. He sees the people. And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people.</p><p>And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people. And he's able to see all the people.

But if you would just stop and take the time to see that there are people who are hurting not only in the church, but in your community and in this world that doesn't know Jesus Christ.</p><p>and in this world that doesn't know Jesus Christ. There's little room for you and I to be what? Self-conserving. Self-focus. Self-loving. Self-loving. I mean, the gospel displays that to us, doesn't it? I mean, the gospel displays that to us, doesn't it? That's why it says here, "Have this mind among you which is yours in Christ Jesus which is yours in Christ Jesus who, though he was in the form of God who, though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God." did not count equality with God."

So, when we look at Ephesians chapter 5, So, when we look at Ephesians chapter 5, it is very interesting where Paul makes a connection it is very interesting where Paul makes a connection for sexual immorality, impurity, or covetousness that is what idolatry.</p><p>This is so interesting how he makes that connection. You can see, any sexual sin You can see, any sexual sin ultimately is the worship of self. ultimately is the worship of self. Which is what? Root of all idolatry. Root of all idolatry. Now, obviously, we don't Now, obviously, we don't text savvy, text savvy, sophisticated, enlightened culture, enlightened culture, we don't have images of Gods made from stone we don't have images of Gods made from stone or wood If you go to third world countries If you go to third world countries or India, or even many parts of China or India, or even many parts of China even today, when you walk into a Chinese restaurant even today, when you walk into a Chinese restaurant you have a little image of you have a little image of Chubby Buddha you have a little image of Chubby Buddha which is a form of idolatry which is a form of idolatry but see, idolatry is basically, what is this?</p><p>is making God is making God into your image that's what it is and it's actually worship of self and it's actually worship of self and all sexual sin and all sexual sin it's a desire to fulfill it's a desire to fulfill your pleasure your pleasure, thus it is a worship of self, which is idolatry this is what Paul is saying here and he pauses don't let no one deceive you with empty words empty words it says in verse 11, take no part in unfairful works of darkness, but instead expose them for it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret I tell you, today's culture is very interesting times we live in there was a time in America that the greatest virtue everybody know what it was?</p><p>the greatest virtue in America used to be truth truth look at all the universities even Berkeley considered one of the most liberal universities, Berkeley if you see there anybody graduate from Berkeley? no? nobody? what is your motto at Berkeley? no? really? even at Berkeley you don't know? look at the picture if you look at the Berkeley their logo, there's a book that's open, which is the Bible and there's a torch and Berkeley's motto is "let there be light" you look at all the universities that started but many of them are Christians, whether it's Yale or Harvard the virtue, the purpose of the universities was to pursue what?</p><p>truth to pursue truth in the light of the gospel you know what the greatest virtue in America today is? it's not truth it's tolerance it's tolerance no longer is truth it's tolerance, right? ok? now do you know how stupid that is? that is so stupid that's why today because our greatest virtue no longer is truth it's tolerance, why?</p><p>all these sexual deviations like the Bible talks about, has become mainstream, not only mainstream it has become what? celebrated whether it's transsexual, whether it's homosexual, bisexual whether it's polygamy whether it's any sexual activity outside of the context of marriage today, because in the name of tolerance it's not only accepted but it's celebrated think about how stupid that is, right?</p><p>like, what would you think if I said to my wife "honey, I tolerate you" you think about that tolerance is a cowardly way of accepting people, right? ok? without loving them and so we live in a culture today of political correctness, right? in the name of tolerance to accept all forms of deviation that is contrary to scripture, which is not love at all because in society today tolerance is considered love, it's not love it's cowardice and by the way the most proponents, the group of people who are the most proponents of tolerance are the most intolerant think about that think about that they are I don't know if you guys follow what's happening to our universities ok?</p><p>today in our schools, right? we have safe zones safe zones? what the heck is that? people are in our universities now, and some of you just finished college, right? you know what I'm talking about they're afraid to dialogue ok? clashes of ideals oh because I'm a snowflake don't tell me something that I disagree with you.</p><p>Your language is offensive oh, that's hate speech you guys all smile and laugh you know exactly what I'm talking about, right? Berkeley, the University of Berkeley, that's known for truth forsaken for truth now proponents of tolerance who have become the most intolerant if they bring a speaker that is contrary to some of the beliefs, that is politically incorrect, what do they do?</p><p>they burn down the campus now you look at me and say "Pastor Aaron, what are you talking about? How does that relate to the gospel?" it has everything to do with the gospel because I'm telling you, we are living in times, and it is not going to get any easier, right?</p><p>where the gospel will be hate speech you look at me and say "Pastor, you're crazy, right? Look at Canada today Peter and I were talking about this you can't say that homosexuality is a sin anymore churches that preach the gospel preach repentance, point people to their sin and point them to Jesus Christ, right?</p><p>are being shut down by the government this is not China we're talking about Canada you don't think that's going to happen to America? It's happening now that you can't even dialogue truth think about it, think about it in culture or a university, how in the world are you going to evangelize a dying world without the gospel?</p><p>when the gospel becomes offensive language it becomes hate speech these are the times we're living in so I want to encourage you I want to challenge you, right? as Paul says, right? we're not to tolerate sin, because tolerance of sin is not love we are called to expose the works of darkness speaking the truth in love and always, as Peter says in 1 Peter chapter 3 always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and respect see, love pleases God right?</p><p>love pleases God that's the wisdom of the heart that's the wisdom of the soul second, love bears one another's burdens turn with me to Galatians chapter 6 Galatians 6 brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression you who are spiritual should restore him or her in the spirit of gentleness keep watch on yourselves lest you too be tempted Galatians 6 says here, but what?</p><p>bear one another's burdens, so fulfill the love of Christ right? so what? love bears one another's burdens, there's just two things when I talk about burdens, right? there is the general idea of people's struggles in life it could be financial struggle it could be marital struggle it could be relational struggles, it could be you know, maybe once business is not doing so well okay, just burden it could be because their health is not good it's very generally speaking your brothers and sisters' burdens it's the idea of coming alongside right?</p><p>to bear, to help carry, okay? their burdens, specifically here, what Paul is talking about is that if someone is caught in what? transgression caught or fell into sin okay? our job of those who are spiritual is not just pastors, but it's the idea of one who is mature, not perfect but mature should restore that individual in the spirit of gentleness so what is the the calling of love?</p><p>love bears one another's burdens we are called to what? come alongside if you have a brother and sister who's in sin, and to confront them in a loving manner, with what? it says with all gentleness right? and keep yourself, at least you too why? because we are all we could all fall into temptation we are all prone, in one way or another to fall into transgression but see, bearing one another's burden what does it do?</p><p>it fulfills the law of Christ and Paul says, for if anyone thinks he is something, when he's nothing he deceives himself what is he saying? be humble when someone falls into sin you don't rejoice over that because it greased the Holy Spirit and it hurts the testimony of the gospel but we are called to what?</p><p>love and care, and pursue those who might fall into sin because why? because we are all weak in many ways, but let each one test his own worth and then his reason to boast will be himself alone and not in his neighbor for each will have to bear, what?</p><p>his own load, right? we all fight our own individual temptation, but we are also called to what? love and bear one another's temptations, and sin that's why being in community is so important that's why having brothers and sisters close to your life where you are able to openly confess your sins and share about your struggles and your temptations and let one who is taught the worst share all good things with one who teaches I'm going to show a picture this is one of my favorite pictures of alright I love this picture okay not because I served in the military right?</p><p>it just shows it just it speaks volumes to me it speaks so much volumes to me you can look it up for a while but see in the military we have a motto, you know what that is? never leave a fallen comrade behind never leave a fallen comrade behind in the military we have this motto, right?</p><p>we believe that if someone is wounded or someone is captured we will make every effort to go rescue that POW the prisoner of war or one who is missing in action, called MIA that we carry each other's burdens the effort, the extent the degree, right? it's that motto of caring for our brother caring for our fellow comrade who probably been wounded or captured this motto is what makes the military so unique compared to any other organization any other organization and so my question to you is this how much more should the church that is redeemed by the love of God through the sacrifice of Christ care for one another and why?</p><p>carry each other's burdens, because love carries what? each other's burden amen church? let me give you a let me give you an example John Troika come up here for a minute he's my brother from another mother two things in common we both love Dodger baseball go Dodgers, woo! yeah!</p><p>and number two we have the same last name another common thing we're both good looking, alright? (laughter) let me just give you an example, right? you know sometimes in life life happens it does happen and you know what? because of life, because of tradition I'm going to stumble and fall and if I stumble and fall the last thing I need you to do is kick me in the butt I need you to carry me sometimes pick me up brother can you pick me up?</p><p>(laughter) and sometimes you're going to stumble and fall and I'm going to kick you brother but other than I kick you but I'm going to carry you too man come on man, let's get up here see, God calls us to carry each other sometimes, right? to help each other to encourage each other to pray for each other to love each other that's what the burden of the Bible is talking about here amen, let's give John a beautiful applause (applause) (applause) can we shut this down?</p><p>thank you, thanks brother from another mother, amen (laughter) love carries one another's burdens church it does and then verse 9 actually goes to say and let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will weep if we do not give up verse 10 so then as we have opportunity let us do good to everyone and especially for those who are in what?</p><p>the household of what? faith, church the church love bears one another's burden Paul keeps saying don't grow weary of doing good and I'm telling you, it's not easy carrying people's burdens because like I tell you, right? life is messy, people's issues are messy, but we don't abandon people's issues, we don't abandon them, okay?</p><p>so don't give up, don't give up in doing good, keep loving keep serving, keep praying keep striving, because why? the greatest philosopher said what? we are too legit to quit (laughter) (laughter) Peter Pompano is the only one who knows what I'm talking about the hammer said that, the hammer, MC Hammer alright?</p><p>I think he had a whole essay, what was it? Too Legit to quit, right? Okay we are! we are the children of God, we are redeemed by God, we are called to be the light of the world, we are called to be the salt of the world, we are the body of Christ we are called to love one another care for the brother and the sister finally, love never fails love never fails we love others because why?</p><p>the love of Christ compels us Romans chapter 8, throw it to me Romans chapter 8 like I share with you you know, if you study and read through the book of Romans, Romans chapter 8 is the epics, the highlight the climax of this book in Romans chapter 8 it's such an awesome chapter and you know, we don't have time to go through everything that Paul speaks about here in Romans chapter 8 let's start with verse 26 it says, likewise the spirit helps us in our weaknesses but we do not know what to pray for as we ought to, but the spirit himself intercedes for us with all means to do for us I love that verse, you know why?</p><p>because you know, I don't know about you, there are times that I don't know what to pray I don't alright, maybe you're spiritual I'm not that spiritual there are times where I go to my devotions and I don't have words to pray, there are times where I've been in seasons of my life I've been in situations of my life where I'm so overwhelmed by the circumstances, I just I don't know what to say, but you know what the Holy Spirit does for us you know what this is saying here, in this verse that the spirit of God prays for us intercedes the spirit himself intercedes for us with growing to do for words in verse 27, and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints again, reminding us that we are weak and our prayer life are not as it ought to be, but you know what the prayer life of the spirit is always on point on target according to the will of God verse 28, many of you know this verse right?</p><p>and we know that all we know that for all, for those who love God, all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose verse 29, for those who he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and those who he predestined, he also called and those who he called, he also justified and those who he justified, he also glorified you know what that is?</p><p>this is the unbreakable chain of the gospel, I love it alright, what chain? the chain, the fact that we are predestined, the chain that we are called the chain that says that we are justified and that eventually we will be glorified remember I shared with you yesterday that you know God will begin a good work in you, will complete to the end and that you are not that powerful to even to stop God's plan and purpose in our lives well Paul is reminding us here it's the gospel chain that is unbreakable chain yes and then he goes on to say here verse 31 right, why?</p><p>why is the gospel unbreakable? why is this gospel chain unbreakable? it says what then should we say to these things? these things that God loves us, his spirit dwells with us, that God has called us, God has justified us and God will glorify us why? so if God is for us, who can be against us?</p><p>verse 23, 32 I'm sorry he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us, how would he not also with him graciously give us all things? so think about it right church, whatever you go into today whether it's the individual or as a church culprit, if you're going through difficult times, right you can always fall back to the truth and the glory of the gospel this is what Paul is saying, because if God who did not spare his own son his own son for your salvation what it says here the promise is that how would he not also give him or give us graciously all things so we can live this life through the spirit of God and through the word of God and by the grace of God and then he says who shall bear any charge against God's elect, right, there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus it is what God who justifies who is it to condemn Christ Jesus is the one who died more than that, who was raised who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us man, not only do we have the spirit of God who dwells in us, that intercedes for us we have the son of God who sits on the right hand of God interceding on our behalf church, what am I saying we cannot lose winner winner, chicken dinner, amen do you see this?</p><p>that's what he's saying here right, we have more than more than that who has raised us who is at the right hand of God who indeed is interceding for us, who shall separate us for the love of Christ he's saying we are what now right all these things who shall separate us for the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword it is a rhetorical question and yes in this earth, in this life we are like sheep like I told you, right and for your sake he says here we are being killed all day long we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered but as Paul says, goes on to say here in verse 37 knowing all these things, we are what?</p><p>more than what? Conquerors and I told what time of when my son was young enough to play sports he's old enough to play sports now but I mean, when he was young I used to love coaching I love coaching besides passion, coaching is one of the ways where you can influence young people's lives right and because I like sports too but when he was about I think 10 years old I was coaching 10, 11 year old flag football and we had an awesome team I mean we would like destroy other teams okay, we would be on like three touchdowns and I would tell my kids, don't let off the pedal let's put the pedal to the metal and crush the other team okay, I would have players come up to me my mic, just like coach come up to me and said coach A, could you like maybe give other team an opportunity to score uh, no okay I didn't believe in everybody getting a trophy philosophy okay, I didn't believe in let's don't keep score because it's gonna hurt little kids, no no no right, trust me, when I was coaching like basketball, when he was my son was 7 or 8, okay it was a little league where you can't keep score but you know who kept score?</p><p>The kids did the kids I mean it's so sad when you live in a society where parents have become children and children have become kids, I mean children have become adults what kind of society we live in, right you could come in last place and still get a trophy, what?</p><p>maybe you grew up that way, but that's not how we grow up, right it doesn't do any good for the kids, right when they're losers, but you give a trophy okay, some of you might not offend them right now, but get over it because why, sometimes losing builds character if you don't teach kids how to lose, right how do you build character, how do they face life?</p><p>think about that, right you know what I'm saying is true so one time we were gathering, we were playing playoffs now, okay, and you know how I got on my knees and I gathered all the kids and you know, you listen to the coach, right and I look to the kids, okay, listen, remember remember kids, right, God loves winners and some of you are offended by that too right now well get over it but it's true okay, we are mortal conquerors and we're not winners because we're any better, because Christ is the winner, and Christ is victorious Christ conquered death Christ conquered Satan thus, through the power of Christ, and by the grace of God and the spirit of God, we are mortal conquerors somebody say amen I know you ain't black, but you can say amen amen come on church this is great preaching, amen that's not a good preaching I'm just saying the truth of God the gospel of God that's something to get excited about we are mortal conquerors in Christ Jesus see, nothing is separated from the love of God right, he says, for I am sure I am confident that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor rulers nor anything present nor things to come, nor powers nor height, nor death, nor anything else and all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God this is what Paul is saying, not just dying and rotting flesh, nor sickness or cancer, not all the troubles and suffering in this life can separate us from the love of God no angels, no archangels, no demons Satan can't separate us from the love of God no kings, rulers, dictators or even Trump can separate us from the love of God not all these things, today, tomorrow or for eternity, can't separate us from the love of God, there's no power on earth in heaven or in hell that can separate us from the love of God there's no place high enough low enough, wide enough that separates us from the love of God there's nothing in all creation even to the ends of the universe or in the darkest black hole can separate us from the love of God absolutely nothing, anyone can separate us nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord I'm tired I'm tired let me wrap this up there's a great hymn you know, one thing growing up in a reformed church as a kid we used to sing a lot of hymns and there's a hymn that I want to I'm not going to sing it to you because I don't want to be a stumbling block to y'all let me read this the lyrics of this hymn the hymn is called "Oh what wondrous love is this" it says "what wondrous love is this, oh my soul, what wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss to bear the dreadful curse for my soul for my soul to bear the dreadful curse for my soul when I was sinking down, sinking down when I was sinking down beneath God's righteous crown, Christ laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul Christ laid down his crown for my soul what wondrous love is this, oh what wondrous love is this oh my soul to lay aside his crown for my soul to lay down lay aside his crown for my soul in the last chorus to God and to the Lamb I will sing to God and to the Lamb who is the great I am while millions join the theme I will sing, I will sing while millions join the theme I will sing and all God's people said Amen</p></div></body></html>
