walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=127s">00:02:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on campus, and when I approach them, they immediately like, "What is he doing on campus?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=132s">00:02:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I try to share the gospel, it's not like before where I can just have casual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=135s">00:02:15.740</a></span> | <span

there, and I saw a guy, he was an Asian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=146s">00:02:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">man probably in his late 50s, and I was able to share the gospel with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=151s">00:02:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was actually very interested, and I started having a conversation and found out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=155s">00:02:35.660</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=161s">00:02:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it was some sort of a, he's here to learn English, but he was only here for about four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=165s">00:02:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">or five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=166s">00:02:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said that there was a group of other people from Nepal who came with him, and in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=172s">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the midst of the conversation found out that he was a devout Buddhist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=176s">00:02:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had many conversations with Buddhists before, and I actually even did a paper when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=180s">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I was in college about Buddhism, the beginning of it and different things that they teach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=185s">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was really intrigued because he knew a lot about Buddhism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=189s">00:03:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">He was a very devout, committed man, and he's in his late 50s, so 50 plus years he's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=196s">00:03:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">studying, and he takes his faith very seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=199s">00:03:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So of course I wanted to share the gospel with him, but I wanted to find out more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=203s">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what he believed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=204s">00:03:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so about 30 minutes straight he just started going off about his doctrines, and it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=208s">00:03:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really intriguing because he was telling me stuff that, some of the stuff I've never heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">before, so it was just interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=213s">00:03:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, this is what you believe in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=215s">00:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This elaborate system of how to get to nirvana, and what are some of the teachings, and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=219s">00:03:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there's three different stages of how to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=224s">00:03:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was very, very interesting, because again, some of it I've never heard before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=228s">00:03:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously I was looking for an opportunity, so okay, now I'm going to break in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=232s">00:03:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when am I going to jump in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=234s">00:03:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just kind of let him finish his story, and it was interesting to a certain degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=240s">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when there was a little break, I stopped and I asked him, "So this is what you believe?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=245s">00:04:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Yes, I believe this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=248s">00:04:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, "Well, how do you know it's true?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=252s">00:04:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know, he was going on for 30 minutes, and he's like, "Huh, you just have faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=260s">00:04:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what everybody, I said, "Okay, so I'm just, I'm not questioning you, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=264s">00:04:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">just asking, I'm just interested in how you came to this conclusion."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=267s">00:04:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So because anybody can just say, "Here's what I believe, you know, like I flew, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=273s">00:04:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and I landed here today."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=275s">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, "Well, how do I believe you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=277s">00:04:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how do you believe that?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=279s">00:04:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you just say faith, then anybody can just say anything, say you just need to believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=284s">00:04:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he just kind of like, "Well, you just have to believe, I guess."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=289s">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, I asked him, so I asked him further, "Do you think you believe what you believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=293s">00:04:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because you tested this out and it was proven to you and you really like, this is what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=296s">00:04:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">convicted about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=297s">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you just happen to be raised, born and raised in a country that taught Buddhism and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=303s">00:05:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">your parents are Buddhists?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=304s">00:05:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "Probably both."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=308s">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so I asked him, "So what part of it have you wrestled with and have come to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=312s">00:05:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the conclusion?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/125629857#t=315s">00:05:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we were going back and forth, and again, this was not an argument, I was just</span></div><div
