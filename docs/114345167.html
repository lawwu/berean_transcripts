My first experience with Alex was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=37s">00:00:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually in a Bible study context. So I was teaching a Bible study over at Pastor Peter's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=41s">00:00:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">house when his church was much smaller. And during those days, we didn't have a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=47s">00:00:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">newcomers so anytime someone new showed up to the church, immediately they stuck out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=52s">00:00:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly with Alex, that was the case because he was, I mean, the moment he walked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=55s">00:00:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in, the biggest guy in the room. And so he walks in and the thing that I vividly remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=61s">00:01:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about Alex was he was wearing his baseball cap backwards. And being the big guy that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=68s">00:01:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he is and before you really get to know him, he's a really friendly guy, but before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=73s">00:01:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">get to know him, he doesn't necessarily appear to be that way, I guess, at first glance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=77s">00:01:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I saw this guy, he's got his hat backwards, he's this big guy, and I just thought to myself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=83s">00:01:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, this guy's bad news. It's bad news, got to make sure we guard the sheep and protect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=89s">00:01:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the flock. And if this guy's looking to cause trouble, then we got to make sure that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=94s">00:01:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">address that early. But clearly first impressions were changed dramatically as he continued</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=100s">00:01:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to come out. We got to know him much better. And it's funny in that Alex going out to China</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=108s">00:01:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is in a lot of ways, I think, going through the same sort of emotions and same sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=114s">00:01:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">mental process that I was going through when we decided to move up to NorCal. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=120s">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he first again came out to Berean, he was just a college student. He was in one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=125s">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">very first small groups I ever led at this church. And just from the get go, he exhibited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=131s">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">his faithfulness, his desire to learn, to grow, and the fact that he really loved Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=136s">00:02:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and he loved the church. And then from that point of being a college student, he eventually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=141s">00:02:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, graduated and he became more of a friend. I didn't really see him as someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=145s">00:02:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that I shepherded, but I saw him as a brother in Christ. And our relationship grew to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=149s">00:02:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">point where I asked him to be one of my groomsmen, to stand up with me on my wedding day, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=155s">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I felt like he was a brother that had encouraged me so tremendously that it would be fitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=161s">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for him to be up there with me when I got married. And then so our relationship changed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=166s">00:02:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from me being his pastor to me being his brother and his friend. And then soon, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=172s">00:02:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as again, Pastor Peter mentioned just a bit ago, he started to serve alongside me. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=177s">00:02:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we were co-laborers too. And when we had sort of broached discussions about possible people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=185s">00:03:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that could help with the college ministry and Alex's name was mentioned, I mean, immediately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=190s">00:03:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">there was no question that he would be a huge asset to our group. And I think the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=194s">00:03:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">why is because again, being that consistent and faithful presence that he is, we knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=200s">00:03:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what we were getting with Alex. We knew that by asking him, there was going to be certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=204s">00:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we could expect for him to contribute into our ministry. And there was no question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=209s">00:03:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about asking him and him not being able to follow through with those things. And so during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=215s">00:03:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the time that we served together as co-laborers in gospel ministry in the local church, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=221s">00:03:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I found my relationship with him continued to transform. And now that he's being sent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=226s">00:03:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">off by this church to do the work of the Great Commission out in China, I think it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=233s">00:03:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of the cherry on top in terms of this process of sanctification and growth and development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=239s">00:03:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've seen taking place in Alex's life. I think it should be gratifying for all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=244s">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">us to see and to take part in what's happening tonight, because this really is God operating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=251s">00:04:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">through brothers and sisters in this community to not only be encouraged by Alex, but to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=257s">00:04:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really seek to encourage Alex and his family as they go out. But yeah, I'm just so thankful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=263s">00:04:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for Alex, for his presence in this church and as much of a loss as it'll be for Berean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=271s">00:04:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to have to send him out, China's going to gain a lot from Alex's presence. And so Alex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=277s">00:04:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is zealous for the gospel.

And so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=289s">00:04:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that Alex is being sent out with the support, the resources and the prayers of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=294s">00:04:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this church, I think we should anticipate and be really eager to hear about all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=298s">00:04:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">God is doing through him and through his family as they labor faithfully in Beijing. So brother,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=304s">00:05:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just again, so thankful for you, thankful for your friendship. I'm thankful that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=309s">00:05:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">can talk about anything from the angels to the Lakers to church ministry to just our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=316s">00:05:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual lives and how things are going with us as parents and as husbands. And I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=321s">00:05:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hope that we are able to encourage you tonight and even in the coming months before you leave,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=327s">00:05:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">as much as you've encouraged us for the last several years.

I think every single one of us that was there at that Bible study when Pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=353s">00:05:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Alex first came into our house had the exact same impression. Yeah, because he didn't look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=360s">00:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like a guy who belonged in a church initially, you know, looked like a gangster guy. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=365s">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he has that serious expression about him. And he, people call him Genghis Khan because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=371s">00:06:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he kind of looked like a Mongolian. And, but again, I think everybody knows who knows him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=377s">00:06:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well. He's like a big teddy bear inside. He tries to be this tough guy, but we know him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=384s">00:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So again, you know, when the scripture tells us, "Sanate lehens hastily," I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=391s">00:06:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to a brother, a pastor who's been ordained outside of the church. And he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=395s">00:06:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">telling me the process and how in the context of the ordination, he felt like, is this it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=402s">00:06:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this the way ordination is supposed to be? Because the room full of 150 people, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=406s">00:06:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">passed the test and a bunch of people that didn't know them were saying, "Hey, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=410s">00:06:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">being commissioned out into ministry." And I remember him just kind of leaving the ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=415s">00:06:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">leaving the ordination process. And he was saying how disappointed he was. He thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=419s">00:06:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be more than that. And, and, and again, we were talking about that ordination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=423s">00:07:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">process. Well, what did the Bible say? How does the Bible say we ought to bring people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=428s">00:07:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">into ministry? That we ought to take very serious, you know, what it means to come into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=434s">00:07:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry that when we ordain somebody and say, as a church, we confirm the calling of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=437s">00:07:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this man, that we are not just hastily sending somebody out. Every once in a while, somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=443s">00:07:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would ask me, "Now, now that you're a pastor, do you encourage your children to go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=448s">00:07:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry?" And, and I say this with a clear conscience. I said, "No, I do not. I do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=454s">00:07:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage. In fact, I wouldn't encourage anybody, push anybody to go into ministry because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=458s">00:07:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">know what ministry means." Is that, there's that beginning process of like Simon of standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=465s">00:07:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in front of people and leading and small groups and all of that stuff.

You know, and you go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=493s">00:08:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this roller coaster ride that's kind of hard to relate. It's like, why, why would, why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=497s">00:08:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">would it, why would it be so difficult? And again, you know, Pastor Aaron knows exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=501s">00:08:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm talking about. And soon Pastor Alex will know exactly what I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=505s">00:08:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the, the wear and tear that being called into ministry requires, and that's why he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=514s">00:08:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">says someone who desires to be an elder is, seeks a noble task. Pastor Alex has never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=522s">00:08:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wavered in that. He, he wanted to do ministry. And again, being called into ministry, Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=530s">00:08:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">says, Paul tells Timothy, 1 Timothy 1.18, wage the good warfare, right? Paul described</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=537s">00:08:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry as warfare. He describes it as a fight in 1 Timothy 6.12. He says, "Fight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=541s">00:09:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the good fight." Again, Paul at the end of his life, 2 Timothy 4.7, he described the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=547s">00:09:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">totality of his ministry as, "I have fought the good fight." So what we're doing today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=552s">00:09:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is really ordaining him to enter into this fight. Not that, the rest of the church is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=557s">00:09:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not, not that if you're not ordained, you're not in this fight. But in particular, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=561s">00:09:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a man is ordained, when the church lays hands on this man, we're asking him to take charge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=566s">00:09:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to take the lead. And when the criticisms come, when the bullets come, that you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=570s">00:09:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the guy in the front who's going to take the bullet first. So ordination really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=575s">00:09:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is a, a setting apart from the church to say, we're ordaining you. We're, we're confirming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=583s">00:09:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you to lead us in this fight. And so, yeah, I'm hesitant. I'm not eager to send my kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=591s">00:09:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">out to battle. Now, if they say they want to go, I will be the first one who will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=596s">00:09:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">proud. And I'd be, I'd be thankful that God is leading them in that direction. But would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=600s">00:10:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I ever push them in that direction? No, I would not push them in that direction. As</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=604s">00:10:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this time of ordination, I want to encourage all of us, and in particularly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=611s">00:10:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, Pastor Alex. What does this day mean? And obviously he's been a pastor, at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=615s">00:10:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">least serving as a pastor. But today, as we confirm him together, you know, when you launch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=622s">00:10:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a new business, you want to make sure that you have your proper, you know, study done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=627s">00:10:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the market study. You know, you, is it the right place? Is there, is there a supply and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=631s">00:10:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">demand? You know, whenever you, you do something new, you want to make sure that all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=637s">00:10:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are prepared and all the tools that you need, that, that you have that. You know, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=642s">00:10:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">year we have graduations. People graduate because they learned a set of facts and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=646s">00:10:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to apply it in the real world. Well, ordination, calling it to ministry, is unlike</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=652s">00:10:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">anything else. It's unlike anything else because the battle that he's fighting is not a psychological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=658s">00:10:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">battle. It's not a sociological battle. It's not a financial. It is spiritual. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=664s">00:11:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">why it says 2 Corinthians 10, 3-4, "For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=669s">00:11:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=673s">00:11:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">divine power to destroy strongholds." This is not something that we can enter into thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=680s">00:11:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that, well, you know, he's very articulate, he's strong, he has, he has a degree. He has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=685s">00:11:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">many experiences. So now he's equipped to go. Paul warns us, again in Ephesians 6, 12</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=692s">00:11:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and 13, "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=698s">00:11:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=702s">00:11:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">evil in the heavenly places." It is a spiritual battle. He said our enemy is spiritual. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=709s">00:11:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so therefore the weapons that we need to gear up on are spiritual. So again, I don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=715s">00:11:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to spend too much time in this, and I know you're already tired of, you know, your tolerance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=719s">00:11:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">level of my preaching is already kind of filled to that point, so I don't want to go too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=724s">00:12:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">over. But at the same time, we want to encourage Pastor Alex, and again, reminder of the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=729s">00:12:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what this battle really is. Because it is a spiritual battle. The scripture tells us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=735s">00:12:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to gear up spiritually. And, you know, we don't look at Pastor Alex and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=741s">00:12:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, he's going to, we believe he's going to be successful and fruitful in ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=744s">00:12:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because, because we see all of his gifts, and he has all this education, all this experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=750s">00:12:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so now he's going to apply it to ministry. That's exactly opposite of what Paul says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=755s">00:12:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's our mentality, you're already setting yourself up for failure. He says, if God really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=760s">00:12:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">exists, which we believe, if heaven and hell really exist, if angels are real, if demons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=765s">00:12:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">are real, we know that our struggle is against them. It may manifest physically, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=771s">00:12:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">real power behind our discouragement, the real power behind the pushback and the persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=778s">00:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is always spiritual. So therefore, we are reminded to gear up spiritually, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=784s">00:13:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to put on the full armor of God. He says in Ephesians chapter 6, he says, "For we do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=790s">00:13:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against authorities, against the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=794s">00:13:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cosmic powers, over the present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=799s">00:13:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">heavenly places. Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=806s">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the evil day, and having done all to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=811s">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the belt of truth." So the first thing that he says, you're putting on the armor of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=816s">00:13:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As we commission him to battle, the first thing he says is to fasten on the belt of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=821s">00:13:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">truth. Now obviously the truth is referring to the Word of God, which we talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=825s">00:13:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this morning. But the idea of fastening on the belt of truth, it has the imagery of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=830s">00:13:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">prepared for action. Truth is not just changing our paradigm or the way that we look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=836s">00:13:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">world. Truth equips us for battle. That's the image that we get. They would tie up their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=843s">00:14:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">belts before they go into battle in order that whatever it is that they're wearing would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=847s">00:14:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not trip them up. So the first idea is to be prepared. He's been trained in seminary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=855s">00:14:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He's in the process of getting his THM. And so he has a lot of biblical knowledge that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=861s">00:14:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">crammed into his head. And all of that is not simply to say, "Well, he's got a degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=866s">00:14:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now he's got an MDiv. He's going to get a THM." And so because he has these titles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=872s">00:14:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, "No, these truths are given to him to prepare him for action." And that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=877s">00:14:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">first thing that he says, that the Word of God is our weapon. In fact, he begins the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=882s">00:14:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">armor with the Word of God. And then at the end of it, he also says to put up the spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=889s">00:14:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sword, which is the Word of God. Second thing that he says is to put on the breastplate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=896s">00:14:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of righteousness. You will be tested. If you push against the darkness, they will push</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=905s">00:15:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">back. You don't go and preach the gospel in the darkness and darkness doesn't say, "Thank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=912s">00:15:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you." If you push against the darkness and you bring the gospel to people who have not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=915s">00:15:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">heard, they are going to push you back. And one of the first ways that you'll see it manifested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=921s">00:15:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is in order to nullify your message, they will nullify the messenger. And that is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=926s">00:15:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">common thing that you see, even with the Apostle Paul. We see in Thessalonica where he preaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=931s">00:15:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel and he was so fruitful. When he left, in order to nullify the power of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=935s">00:15:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel, they were saying that, "That guy is like any other philosopher who came here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=939s">00:15:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All he wants from you is money."

That's why Paul says in Acts 24, 16, "So I always take pains to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=993s">00:16:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have a clear conscience toward both God and man." And the reason why he takes pains to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=998s">00:16:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have a clear conscience before God and man is because he knows. He knows that his life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1004s">00:16:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is a platform to be able to preach the gospel because they would easily nullify, "You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1008s">00:16:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what, Apostle Paul, that guy's saying all this stuff, but look at his life. Look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1012s">00:16:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the way he spends his money. That guy, all he wants is money." So Paul lives in such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1015s">00:16:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a way so that he would not be accused of any wrongdoing. 1 Peter 2, 12, "Live such good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1022s">00:17:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1026s">00:17:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us." Even when they want to disqualify you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1033s">00:17:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, "Live in such a way to put on the breastplate of righteousness that Christ gives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1038s">00:17:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that even if they want to accuse you, they can't." Thirdly, "Put on the shoes for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1043s">00:17:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace." So again, putting on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1047s">00:17:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the shoes, he gives us a picture of being ready to go. And I would say, if, when anybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1053s">00:17:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">says that they're interested in going into ministry, the first thing that I will ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1057s">00:17:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">them is, "Are you ready to go?" If you, once you're done with your training and the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1062s">00:17:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">ordains you, are you ready to go? So what do you mean by ready to go? If you are being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1067s">00:17:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ordained so that you can be here and you see, you see the comforts of, of maybe, on appearance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1074s">00:17:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like, "Well, this is comfortable, this is nice, and this is what I want." The first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1078s">00:17:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thing I would ask is, "Are you ready to go?" Are you standing before God and saying, "Here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1082s">00:18:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">am I, send me." Obviously, Pastor Alex has made that commitment from the get-go. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1089s">00:18:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he is being ordained today because he's already committed to go. The word gospel just means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1096s">00:18:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">good news. And by the nature of the word news, news is not something, you don't tell somebody,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1101s">00:18:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"I have some news," and then walk away. Right? You don't tell somebody, "I got some news."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1106s">00:18:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't say, "I have good news. See you tomorrow." Right? The nature of the word gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1114s">00:18:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">means to tell somebody. That's what the word means, news. So to be a minister of the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1119s">00:18:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">means that he is ready to go. He's ready to tell people. He's ready to proclaim it, wherever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1125s">00:18:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it is God sends him. So the first call of a minister is to stand before God and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1130s">00:18:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"Here am I, send me." If we're not ready to be sent, then we're not ready to be, to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1138s">00:18:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a proclaimer of the gospel. It's to go. But going isn't just about moving location. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1145s">00:19:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Well, if we go to China, we'll go." But again, one of the best insights that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1151s">00:19:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">gained about mission work was from a missionary who was out in the mission field. And he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1156s">00:19:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"The greatest challenge of a missionary is to continue to go." Because you have that initial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1161s">00:19:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going. You pack up your stuff, and it's uncomfortable, and you move to a new location. But our natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1166s">00:19:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">human nature is to learn to adjust. Everywhere we go, make it our home. Whether it's here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1172s">00:19:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's NorCal, or whether it's a foreign country, it's our natural nature to want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1177s">00:19:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make wherever we go our home. And that's the challenge, is to constantly remember that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1182s">00:19:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we are aliens and strangers in this world, whether you are living in Irvine. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1188s">00:19:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's some of the mistakes that we make, is that we think, "Well, we're home, and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1191s">00:19:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not." No, none of us are at home. It's just that when we physically move somewhere, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1197s">00:19:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly reminds us we're not home. So that part of it, putting on the shoe of the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1205s">00:20:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of peace, is to have that mentality to constantly be ready that this is not your home. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1210s">00:20:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">one day we will be home in eternity. Until then, we are to go physically, we are to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1216s">00:20:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">socially, emotionally, and spiritually. Be always ready, wherever God calls us. He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1223s">00:20:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"In all circumstances, take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1228s">00:20:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">flaming darts of the evil one." Why do you need to take up the shield of faith? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1235s">00:20:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you're being set apart from ministry. When the scripture says that you have an adversary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1240s">00:20:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour, guess who the primary target is going to be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1245s">00:20:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Are the people who are the most committed to share the gospel. And so, all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1250s">00:20:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to become a target.

Because if you become a leader, and you fall, the effects are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1258s">00:20:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be much greater. It's not because we're more special, it's just that there's more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1264s">00:21:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">consequences when we fall.

Because they were the closest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/114345167#t=1285s">00:21:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to Christ.
