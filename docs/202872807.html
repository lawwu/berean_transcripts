href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=72s">00:01:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the team is India versus I forgot which country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=75s">00:01:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But because of that you can understand there's a sense of nationalism that's really stoking</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=83s">00:01:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happened was at the start of the game they had asked us to stand, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=88s">00:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously they didn't ask us in English, they asked us in Telugu, which is the native</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=93s">00:01:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">language of the Indians within that region.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=95s">00:01:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They asked the pastors in Telugu if they could stand and if we could stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=100s">00:01:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now at this point we don't know what's going on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=103s">00:01:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the pastors, one of the two, replies to the patrons, "Hey look, we'll stand, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=110s">00:01:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they're American so they're not going to stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=112s">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll stand."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=114s">00:01:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it didn't sit well with one or two people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=118s">00:01:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For the most part the group didn't like it, but for the two it really, really ticked them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=123s">00:02:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=124s">00:02:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of them turns around and kind of motions for us to stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=127s">00:02:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can see he's kind of agitated at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=130s">00:02:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a little angry, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=132s">00:02:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's going like this and I hear music so I'm like, "Okay, it's a national anthem."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=136s">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I try to get the team to stand, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=138s">00:02:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we stand, but the moment we stand, we're like maybe like 10 seconds after the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=143s">00:02:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of the anthem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=144s">00:02:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We stand, we do our thing, we're very respectful, and then we sit down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=149s">00:02:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the patrons goes up to the pastors and they start speaking in Telugu, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=154s">00:02:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I find out later that he's very upset because we didn't stand right away and also he didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=160s">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like the pastor's answer, namely that we wouldn't stand because we're Americans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=167s">00:02:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We thought, "Okay, since they're in this country, all of them should stand and you should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=171s">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on that bandwagon making all of us stand."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=174s">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now none of us minded at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=176s">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Had the team known that's what they wanted, we would have done initially, we didn't care,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=180s">00:03:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=181s">00:03:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The pastors were just trying to be as accommodating as possible to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=186s">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what ended up happening is because this is a very nationalistic environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=191s">00:03:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they have liquor in their system, they start being very aggressive, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=195s">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They come up to the pastors and start yelling at them, berating them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=200s">00:03:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the two gets slapped in the face, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=202s">00:03:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And as all this is going on, the other people within their group, although they didn't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=207s">00:03:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like what they did, they're a little bit more reasonable and they're trying to hold the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=211s">00:03:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">other two back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=212s">00:03:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what ends up happening is the two pastors, one of them splits up, goes outside, he gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=217s">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">hit in the...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=218s">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Unbeknownst to us at the time, he gets hit in the face, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=222s">00:03:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what the pastor told me was two shots to the face right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was some slight bruising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=227s">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The other pastor is inside and they're a hotel, they don't have any security.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=240s">00:04:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a lot of back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=242s">00:04:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They would sit down and they would stare at him, so they'd get back up, sit down, stare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=246s">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and get back up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=247s">00:04:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So finally what they decided to do was put us in a different room, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/202872807#t=251s">00:04:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they watched the game, we didn't see them for the rest of our trip there.</span></div><div
