Good evening, Church family. Let us pray as we begin our night. Heavenly Father, thank you for tonight as we get to gather together for praise and prayer. However our weeks have been, may we come with seeking hearts, with humility knowing we are in need of your mercies. May we come now with eagerness to praise you, to honor you, and to know you, for it would be our greatest desire. Teach us, Lord, how to pray, how to be obedient to you, and to live a life worthy of the gospel we receive. May we take great joy in knowing we as your children can draw near to you with confidence that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need, and all of this because of Christ Jesus. So may you be blessed tonight, Lord, in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let us all rise as we sing these praise songs.   As we gather. As we gather, may your spirit work within us. As we gather, may we glorify your name. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship, we'll be blessed because we care. We'll be blessed because we care. As we gather. As we gather, may your spirit work within us. As we gather, may we glorify your name. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship, we'll be blessed because we care. We'll be blessed because we care. In Christ's love. Step-fast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning. New every morning. Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord. Great is thy faithfulness. Let's sing the step-fast love. The step-fast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning. New every morning. Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord. Great is thy faithfulness. (gentle music) And as we gather. As we gather, may your spirit work within us. As we gather, may we glorify your name. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship, we'll be blessed because we care. We'll be blessed because we care. Knowing well. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship, we'll be blessed because we care. We'll be blessed because we care. (gentle music) Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. O my soul. I'll worship your holy name. The sun comes up. The sun comes up. It's a new day dawning. It's time to sing your song again. Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me. Let me be singing when the evening comes. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. O my soul. I'll worship your holy name. (gentle music) You're rich in love. You're rich in love and you're slow to anger. Your name is great and your heart is kind. For all your goodness I will keep on singing. 10,000 reasons for my heart to clap. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. O my soul. I'll worship your holy name. (gentle music) And on that day, and on that day, when my strength is failing, the end draws near and my time has come. Still my soul will sing your praise unending. 10,000 years and then forever more. So bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. O my soul. I'll worship your holy name. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul. O my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. O my soul. I'll worship your holy name. Lord, I'll worship your holy name. Lord, I'll worship your holy name. (gentle music) - And then you may be seated. - All right, thank you for all of you who've come to take time to pray with us. We're gonna do things a little bit different tonight, but before we get started, today is June 25th, right? And you guys all probably know that, but June 25th is a special day in Korea because this is the day that the North Koreans came in and started the war with the South. And so when I was younger, there actually used to, there's a song that we would all sing and that basically is that 6/25/1950 is a day that we should never forget. And so every kid who grew up in Korea during that era knows that song by heart. And the reason why they made us sing that is because it was a constant reminder for us that we were at war with North Korea and that we should always be ready. And so again, back in the '70s, when they would ring the sirens at 10 o'clock, you'd have to go home. And anybody else who stayed outside after 10 o'clock, it's like, oh, you're a North Korean spy, or if you disobey the government, you're a North Korean spy. So there was this constant warning that we can go back to war with North Korea at any time. And so again, in Korean, we would sing this song, especially on this day, we would sing this song, say 6/25, this is the day that our enemies came marching into South, and we would sing this in Korean. I share this with you because the scripture tells us that we are to be reminded that we are in this constant spiritual warfare. And when we forget that and we begin to live like civilians, as if this is our home, then our first thing that you'll see is our prayer life suffers. Because whether you pray or don't pray, because it is a spiritual endeavor, you don't necessarily see a radical difference in your life. If you don't study the Bible, you know, you get shamed when you go to Don Quixote. If you know more about the scripture, you can share with other people, and there's a way to measure if you know the Bible or don't know the Bible. But prayer is directly connected to our soberness and understanding that there's a spiritual battle going on. And so as I've been mentioning, I'm sure if you've been on the Internet and you've been hearing other pastors, there's been constant reminder that the devil has been very active recently, not just through what's been going on in the government, but the pulpit, and as I mentioned last Sunday, has been corrupted. There's always been corruption in it, but now it's almost like if you don't test what's coming off the pulpit, you will be deceived. That's how much wrong doctrines are coming off of pulpits. And many, some of them may not even be Christians. And it's no longer shocking what I hear from the pulpit. And so in order to engage in this battle, we need to build a church that's going to last more than you. We want to make sure that we build a church where it's going to be inherited by the next generation, your children and children after that. In order to do that, we need to have a healthy church, more than being concerned about multiplying fast and getting as many churches planted as much as possible. I think the greatest problem today is not that we don't have enough churches. The problem today is the churches aren't healthy. And so we've always, from the very get-go of the church, wanted to build a healthy church. And then when the church is healthy, we pray that it would multiply. And so in building the healthy church, we put four visions together. The first and the most important is, when you come through Bryn, that we want to have a God-centered church, not man-centered. God-centered meaning that we are primarily concerned about what God thinks. Before we think about what would they think if they hear this, what kind of church does our neighbors want? What kind of church is needed in our generation? Our primary concern is what does God think? God-centered. In fact, one of the most freeing things for Christians is for us to first and foremost recognize how insignificant we are, that we don't come into church saying, "What does it have for me?" We evaluate everything based upon, "What does it do for me?" Galatians 2:20, it says, "We have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer us who live." And so our primary stumbling block as Christians is when we are the center, even though we don't say it, in the way that we live, we evaluate everything based upon how it affects me. And so that's what we're trying to reverse. The Bible tells us the first step of sanctification is recognize that we are lent. We are just a mist that comes and goes. That's why the psalmist says, "Help me to number my days so that I recognize how temporary I am." And so when Christ truly becomes the center, that's when we can really live because the life we live in our flesh usually goes against God. So our primary thing, we want God to be exalted. We want God to be the center. So everything that we do, our question is, "Would they like it? Would people come? Is this the kind of church that our neighborhood wants?" That's not the question that we wrestle with. The question that we are constantly wrestling with is, "Is God honored by what we do, whether people like it or not, whether the church grows or not?" Secondly, if we want to be God-centered, you have to be Word-centered. You can't be God-centered if you are not in the Word because even God-centeredness can be us-centered if it is not centered on the Word of God. We project what we think God wants based upon our desires and what we want Him to be. And so in order to be God-centered, we have to be Word-centered. So our natural question in the way that we do church is not, "Does it work?" Our primary question is, "Is it biblical?" Is that what the Bible teaches? What does the world think? That is not our primary concern. Our primary concern is, "What does the Bible say?" The difference between a church that is centered around the shifting culture of our generation is that every time there's a movement, the church changes. Their vocabulary changes. Their sermon changes. What is emphasized changes. The culture of the church changes. What is allowed in the church changes. A Word-centered church never changes because the Word of God does not change. Whether it was 2,000 years ago, whether it is now, or whether hopefully 100 years from now, that what we believe in this church, what is practiced in this church, is not going to be any different than this generation, your generation, and our grandchildren's generation. And so that's what we're trying to build in the church-- God-centered church based upon the Word-centered church that is going to last. It's not going to change because our culture is changing. Obviously, based on that, that's the church that we're trying to build. That's why when we talk about building a church in truth and love, it's never one or the other. Every once in a while, we hear things like, "Well, we want to make a safe place," because that's a term that's being used in our culture. Because whether you're a Christian or not Christian, we need a safe place-- a safe place at work, a safe place at school, a safe place at home, a safe place at church. That type of language is not coming from the Word of God. That kind of language is coming from our culture. What we want in a church is not a safe place. That's not our primary concern. Our primary concern is where the truth is exalted, and sometimes the truth will cut. And when non-Christians come to the presence of God, they should not feel safe. When they hear the Word of Christ and the gospel is proclaimed, and they leave after the clear teaching of the gospel, and they feel safe, the gospel was not presented properly because the gospel warns non-Christians that there is judgment coming. So how can we create a safe place for non-Christians who are going to be judged if they do not repent and still in unrepentance feel safe? And so we want to make sure that we build a church based on love and accountability, right? That we want to practice love, but in the context of truth. And so that's the church we want to build. And then evangelism happens as a result of that. You know, most people think that evangelism is the hardest part of the fourfold vision. In reality, the fourth vision is actually the easiest part because you go to work, you talk to people. You go to restaurants, you have friends, right? Tell me a single person here that doesn't have friends or doesn't talk to people, right? The only difference is when we're not sober and we're not walking right with God, the conversation is forced. But when you're walking right with God and you're sober, it's like talking about anything else in your life. If it's important in your heart, it will come out. How hard is it for you to talk about the best movie that you've watched? How hard is it when you have this meal and it was the best sandwich that you had to go and tell your friend about it? It's not that hard, right? The reason why it's hard is because we're not sober in other areas, so we end up artificially, you know, manufacturing conversations that we normally would not have. And so I share all of this because we want to be mindful of the kind of church that we're building, right? As our church continues to grow, whether we were 50 or 500 or 5,000, that our principles are not going to change. We're not going to change. Even if people come in and say, "Well, at my church we used to do this, and if we did this, more people will come, and my non-Christian friends will feel more comfortable if we did this." We can always improve on everything that we're doing, but fundamental things that we believe in the church will not change, cannot change, because it is word-centered, okay? So all of this, everything that I've said, obviously it's something that we go over in our church membership class, but in order to do all of this, it is all contingent upon our first vision, which is being God-centered. If we're not meeting God, word of God becomes manufactured. It becomes a source of pride instead of a source of tool or guidance, right? A church becomes more of a neighbor, a community, than really a place where we're carrying out the mission of God. In evangelism, it's like pulling teeth, right? You're trying to sell something that you yourself don't believe or practice. So all of it is contingent upon this first vision, right? Are we meeting God at church? What does Christ mean to you? And that's why we want to pray. That's why our theme for this year was "Watch and to Pray." We have to--prayer is not one of many things that the church needs to do. If we're not praying, everything else doesn't matter. We're doing it by our own strength. And so we're going to change things up today. I'm going to--instead of giving you a chunk of time to pray, I'm going to lead you in prayer, okay? So I'm actually going to do something I haven't done in years. I'm going to lead us in worship, and I'm going to ask you guys to join with me in worship. And the songs that I picked are brand-new songs for those of you who are of certain age, okay? Because we don't sing them. In fact, I don't think anybody sings them anymore. So it may be new to some of you, and some of you who are a little bit older, it'll be more nostalgic. And the reason why I picked those songs is because my repertoire is very small, and I pick songs that are easier for me to play. That's one reason. The other reason was I actually was hoping that Isaac and the team would be able to lead it, but when I gave him the songs, he didn't know more than half of it. So he is of that age where he hasn't heard it, okay? The other reason why I chose these songs is because each one of these songs are songs of prayer. So if you watch it, it's not just doxology. We're not just repeating doctrine. Each one of these songs are simple songs, but they're a prayer to God. And so I'm going to lead you through the prayers, and so as we're sitting, I'm going to be repeating these songs, and so you don't have to follow along and say, "Oh, man, he's singing it three times already." But I want you to pay attention to the lyrics, and when you sing these songs, sing it as a prayer to God, okay? So when in the lyrics, there's a petition for God in the singing, sing it as if you are praying this prayer, right? Don't just mouth the words. We're not here just to sing. God is not pleased just because we have good voices, right? In fact, I remember years ago when I was in seminary, my seminary professor took all the students to a synagogue in L.A. just so that we can experience what synagogue worship is like. And I remember being there 90% of the time we sang, and they didn't just sing anything. They just opened up the psalm, and he would recite something in Hebrew, and then the congregation would recite it back in Hebrew in song. And so the whole time we were there, maybe about 40, 45 minutes, it was singing, and then the rabbi would come up, and he would give a short exposition, and then they'd have celebration afterwards. And he said that in the early church in the synagogues that this is what the worship looked like. They would just literally open up the scriptures, and then they would sing it, right? And so a lot of the songs that we're going to be singing tonight are related to a particular psalm that is put into words, not all of them, but some of them. And so I'll guide you through that as we go. So I'm going to get positioned here. So don't pay attention to the quality, okay, because I haven't--I haven't--you know, I really wrestled with whether I should do this or not because I don't want to be a distraction to you, but I really want you guys to pray. I really want the songs that you sing be expression of your heart toward God, right? And so don't sit there like you're watching a concert. Don't sit there like you're just singing a song. Really position yourself to pray. So if you want to, you know, get somewhere, if you want to buy Epivirus, if you want to stand up, it's up to you, okay? But please use this opportunity to focus your attention to pray before God. So let me get seated over here, and then I'll pray, and then we'll get started. While I'm sitting up, just take a few minutes to pray on your own, to get ready, okay? And when I'm ready, I'll get started.        All right, let me pray for us and get started. Heavenly Father, Lord, we gather together as a church to seek your face. Whatever burdens that we have brought into this room, I pray, Lord God, that you would anoint this time, Lord God, that we may search you with all our hearts to seek, to ask, to knock. Help us, Lord God, not to be casual in this time, but really to be able to know your heart. Lord, use these songs to stir in our hearts, Lord God, the longing that these words would represent our very selves, Lord God. So we pray for your anointing, we pray for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Before we get started, again, each one of these songs I'm going to try to introduce to you. And again, as we sing, and then I'll see if, you know, I may extend it, I may not. But during any of this time, if you want to pray, you know, as you're singing, just pray, you know, along with these words. This is my desire, this is what I desire, and to just take some time to pray however you want to pray. This first one that we're singing is "As We Seek Your Face." Again, this is a pretty simple song. And the term "seeking your face," as we come before God, as I said, is not a casual seeking. So if you look at 2 Chronicles 7, 14-15, and as they were dedicating the temple, after Solomon built it, it said, "And my people who are called by my name "humble themselves and pray and seek my face "and turn from their wicked ways. "Then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, "and will heal their land. "Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive "to the prayers offered in this place." And so the temple was dedicated as a place of prayer. And the term that is used here, if they come and seek my face, seek my face isn't just a casual coming into the temple to drop off your offering and then to go home. The idea of seeking your face is coming to Christ, coming to God in an intimate setting. Just like today, you may get a phone call or you may get an email, but if you want an intimate conversation with somebody, say, "Hey, let me see you face to face." And so that's the idea here when it says to seek God's face, that we're not just coming here to sing, to put words together for obligation, but a longing in our hearts to really be in his presence. And so that's what this song is, as we seek your face, may we know your heart. Not just to know you mentally, but your own heart. And so as we sing it, hopefully this would be our prayers together.  As we seek your face, may we know your heart. In your presence, acceptance. As we seek your face, may we know your heart. In your presence, acceptance. As we seek your face, at your feet we fall. At your feet we fall, sovereign man. By daily, only at your feet we fall. Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you. Let the world around you be known. Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you. Let your eyes out and worship and your head. Let's sing, as we seek your face. As we seek your face, may we know your heart. In your presence, acceptance. As we seek your face, at your feet we fall. At your feet we fall, sovereign man. By daily, only at your feet we fall. Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you. Let the world around me fade away. Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you. Let your eyes out and worship and your head. The next worship psalm, as a dear packet for the water. It comes from Psalm 42, one through five. It's a psalm written during the captivity in Babylon. And it was a psalm just longing for God, wanting to be at the temple and to worship. And so the psalmist is singing, I long for you, I desire you. Because they miss the corporate worship at the temple so much. And so the part that I really enjoy singing, as a dear packet for the water, so my soul longeth after thee. And you alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. Again, it comes from Psalm 42, one through five. Let me read it for you. Psalm 42, as a dear pants for the books, so my soul pants for you, oh God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my food day and night. For they say to me all day long, where is your God? These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God. With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival. Why are you in despair, oh my soul, and why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise him for the help of his presence. So again, I pray that you would take it to heart, right. Don't attend prayer. Don't attend worship. Worship. Come to pray. So if your posture is -- I am just going to sit here and watch. Let's see how this thing goes. I hope that you would really engage. And if your heart is hardened, maybe you are distracted by something, pray. You don't have to sit, just sit there and pray and seek God. I am so entangled with things that I shouldn't have been entangled with. And I just don't have that heart. To take time to pray and really seek the Lord, seek his face. So I want you to sing these songs and sing it as your words. Right. Not the psalmist, not some song that was written. But these are your words. I long to have you. I may not be there but this is my desire. I long to have you. As the dew planted for the water so my soul longed after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. As the dew planted for the water. As the dew planted for the water so my soul longed after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king. I love you more than any other soul, much more than anything. You alone. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You alone. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. I want you more than gold or silver only you can satisfy. You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eye. You alone. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit lead. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. And I long to worship thee.  Father, that truly is our desire. Lord, I pray that you will stir in our hearts a longing for you, Father God, that this world cannot satisfy. Help us, Lord God, in our weakness, in our tempted minds and hearts, Lord God, that it's been compromised because the material things, the compromises, Lord, that we've allowed in our hearts. I pray as this psalm, as this song, Lord God, longs and yearns that this would be our true desire, that this would be our prayer. I pray that you would build a church in this generation, Lord God, that our love would not grow cold because of the increase of wickedness. Help us, Lord, to cling to you with all our might. Lord, that as the deer panteth for the water, that we would long for you more than anything else. Amen. Lord, I want to know you more. I know that each week there's different things that we wrestle with. You know, we come on Sunday and we get convicted or, you know, a Bible study or you hear people's testimony, but as soon as we go home, there's Netflix, bills to pay, children to raise, and we are so easily entangled. And so this song, again, is a reminder that in the midst of entanglement, that we need Christ more than anything else. In 1 Timothy 6, 9 through 10, it says, "Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs." We have to make money. We have to pay bills. We want to be wise in making investments. But if we don't guard our hearts, that becomes our primary concern, that we can easily be fooled to think that my greatest calling as a father or a mother is to make a lot of money and provide for our children. And next thing we know, our hearts are far from God. And it's not money itself. It's a love of money. And nobody thinks that they're pursuing the love of money. It just happens in the context of I've got to be a good father. I've got to take care of my kids. I've got to be responsible. But if we're not careful, the love of money creeps in, and that becomes our primary pursuit without us ever making a decision. In 2 Timothy 4:10 it says, "For Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica." Demas, if you know, in scripture was one of Paul's travel companions. He suffered along with Paul. He went to jail along with Paul. He was stoned along with Paul. But at the tail end when he was about to be executed, Demas had enough, and he packed up his bags and went home. And if you notice, it says he went back to Thessalonica. You know, we've been studying through Thessalonica, and Thessalonica was a model church that in the context of much persecution, they persevered, and they were so--Paul was so encouraged to hear the news, and yet at the end, it says Demas, one of the key figures in this church, ended up being tempted, and he packed up his bag and left. No one is exempt from this temptation. So if we don't fight to guard our hearts, this will happen. It's not--it can happen. It does happen, right? And so this song kind of, you know, helps us to focus our attention. At just the time that I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine, right? No one's sick. My bills are paid. My job is great. My family is great. But I feel at ease. I feel at home, and I know I'm not alone. Then in my rest, there comes a test that shakes me till again I know that what I had is not enough, and again, I've got to grow. This probably is a lot of us. There's nothing urgent happening. Kids are well-fed, have a good job, you know, you have money being saved in the retirement, but your heart is not where it needs to be. And so God reminds us, right, to examine our hearts so that we do not drift. So at just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine.  At just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine. I feel at ease. I feel at home. And I know I'm not alone. Then in my rest, there comes a test that shakes me till again I know that what I had is not enough, and again, I've got to grow. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. The full supply I'll find as I move closer to the heart of God to strengthen me, to nourish me, and to fill my mind with him. I've truly grown, but even so, my hunger hasn't gone away. Still I long, so I thirst to know him more each day. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Let's sing one more time. Lord, I want to know you more. And really make it our longing for God. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Deep within my heart, I want to know you. Lord, I want to know you. And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. Lord, I want to know you more. As we've been going through Hebrews, the section that we studied a couple weeks ago, Hebrews 12, 12-13 says, "Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble, and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed." And again, this is a description of someone who is just fatigued. And maybe some of us came into this room with struggles, which I know, there's been a lot of stuff that's been going on. And again, you know, obviously this is not something I can share, but we've been praying for you. And I know there's other people that you haven't shared. There's heartaches, some of you have lost loved ones, some of you going through various things. And maybe just fatigue, you know, you're fighting your sin, and it just seems like you're going in circles over and over again. Maybe you're having marriage problems. Maybe you have, you know, longings that you've been praying for that you feel like God's not answering, and sometimes you're just fatigued and tired. And so that's what Hebrews 12, 12-13 is describing. And again, as we said a couple weeks ago, where we are promised by God that God does not turn away a broken reed or, you know, even a little wick that's been burned, right? And so this song is "Precious Lord, Take My Hand" is somebody who is fatigued, just longing and crying out to God, like, "I need your help." So if you know the song, please sing it a little bit louder so that I can follow. Okay, but again, let's make this our longing and praying together. Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand. I am tired, I am weak, I am worn. Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light. Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on. So one more time, precious Lord. Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand. I am tired, I am weak, I am worn. Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light. Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on. When my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near. When my love is almost gone. Hear my cry, hear my call. Hold my hand, lest I fall. Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on. When the darkness appears and the night draws near, and the day is past and gone, at the river I stand. Guide my feet, hold my hand, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Precious Lord, take my hand. Precious Lord, lead me on. Before we sing the next song, why don't we take a few minutes and come before the Lord individually. And just pray before God. The songs that we sang and the things that you brought into this room. And take some time to pray on your own before we move on to the next song. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ We may have some specific people that comes to mind when you think about this. And to really during while we are praying and crying out to God, cry out on their behalf. Cry out on behalf of the people, our generation. People who are lost. And to really be a light for them. And to pray for them. Intercede for them. Okay. So make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry. Not just empty prayer. Not just words. But a cry. A longing in my heart. Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh. Cause me to stand and cry out for this land. Cause me to be one who is set free. To stand as a house of prayer. Cause me to stand out, cry out for this land. When was the last time you cried out to God for sinners to come to Christ? So if it's hard to pray that, sing it. Right. That this is our desire. This is what I desire. That this song would lead us to pray and cry out on behalf of our generation.  Make me a prayer. Let my prayers be a cry. Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh. Cause me to stand and cry out for this land. Cause me to be one who is set free. To stand as a house of prayer. Make me a prayer. Make me a prayer. Let my prayers be a cry. Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh. Cause me to stand and cry out for this land. Cause me to be one who is set free. To stand as a house of prayer. Make us a prayer. Make us a prayer. Let our prayers be a cry. Humble our heart so that you may draw nigh. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. Cause us to be one who is set free. To stand as a house of prayer. Make us a prayer. Make us a prayer. Let our prayers be a cry. Humble our heart so that you may draw nigh. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. Call us to stand. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. Call us to stand. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. To stand as a house of prayer. Lord we pray that You would cause our church to be a place where we can come to pray together. To cry out for our generation, Lord God. Lord I pray that the reality of Your salvation and Your judgment will become more and more real to us, Lord God. That we may live sober lives. Help us, Lord God, to see this generation. Our brothers, our sisters, our friends, Lord God, who do not know You. That we would ache on their behalf. That we would be on our knees crying out, Lord God, for their salvation. So we pray, Father, that You would make us a house of prayer. Individually and together, Lord. That You would help us open our eyes to see that this generation will pass. And so we pray, Father God, that the time and the opportunity, the gifts, the finances, the freedom that we have, help us to be all poured out, Lord God, for the sake of Your name.  After we sing this last song, I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray together. This is the only song that isn't necessarily in prayer. But I want you to, again, because this represents, I think, all our testimony. To remember what He saved us from, where we're at, what it is that we have, right? And this is, we may have come to Christ in different ways, but this is all our testimony. I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way. The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave. Had no hope that You would own a rebel to Your own. And if You had not loved me first, I would refuse to steal. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.  I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way. The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave. Had no hope that You would own a rebel to Your own. And if You had not loved me first, I would refuse to steal. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. But as I ran my hell-bound race, indifferent to the cost, You looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross. And I beheld God's love display. You suffered in my place. You bore the wrath reserved for me. And all I know is grace. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. Now Lord, I would be Yours alone and live so mighty. The strength to follow Your commands could never come from me. Oh Father, use my ransomed life in any way You choose. Let my song forever be my only voice is You. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. Hallelujah, all I have is Christ. Hallelujah, Jesus is my life. Lord, we pray that this would truly be our longing and our sincere prayer that we would recognize Lord God that all we have is Christ. And all we desire is Christ. Help us Lord God to seek Your face, not only tonight, but every day Father God. To know You, to love You, to proclaim You. We be the greatest passion that consumes our thoughts and our hearts. Help us Lord God to seek You as a dear pandith for the water. That we would long for Your presence. That we would drink of Your water and eat of Your bread. That we would find this joy Father God that can only be found in You. Help us never to forget what it is that we have been saved from. That our worship Lord God will be an overflowing thanksgiving in our hearts to You. So I pray that as we have sung and as we have prayed, help us Lord God to be a church that lives up to our prayers. We thank You Father in Jesus' name, we pray. So if I can break you guys up into groups of maybe about three. And I'm going to just give you about 10 minutes, maybe two or three. Just grab some people around you, take some time to pray. If you have urgent things that you want to share and pray, you can pray for that. Otherwise, just take some time to pray for each other just generally. And then I'm going to call you up in about 10 minutes. Our worship team is going to come up and they're going to wrap us up. So if you can turn the lights on right now. And then just grab two or three people around you and turn your chairs around and take some time to pray. You only have about 10 minutes.                                                                           For those of us who are still praying, please continue to do so. If not, let us all rise as we close this night with this song of adoration, "How Great Thou Art."  >> Oh Lord, my God. >> Oh Lord, my God. When I in awesome wonder consider all the works Thy hands have made. I see the stars. I hear the rolling thunder that hath rewound the universe to sleep. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. And when I think that God his Son, thus bearing, sent him to die, I scarce can take it in. That on that cross, my burden lightly bearing, he bled and died to take away my sin. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art.  Christ shall come. When Christ shall come, with a shout of affirmation, and take me home, with joy shall fill my heart. Then I shall bow, with love of adoration, and there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. How great Thou art.  Amen. Let us bow and pray together. Our God, we absolutely believe that you are mighty and powerful. And God, you are great beyond our imagination and what our minds can perceive. Help us, Father God, to know you in greater light. Help us, Father God, to thirst for you, that we may know you in every facet of who you are. Lord, we repent of the fact that sometimes we are experts in different fields, markets, ideologies, and more. And yet, Father God, we do not exercise the same kind of intentionality to come to know you. But Lord, we desire more. Father, we want to love you to greater depths. Father God, we want to experience walking with you in greater faith. And so I pray that this would be our regular experience day to day. Lord, we do pray that anybody in here who is struggling with faith, would your word minister to them. Father, would your spirit convict them. And God, illuminate their eyes. And for every single one of us, Lord, truly desired to walk with you, we recognize that it is a battle. Help us, Father God, with great dependency, yet in the power of your spirit, in the power of your word, to persevere. We thank you for this night, Lord. We lift all things to you in Christ's name. Amen. Good evening, everybody. Just a real quick announcement. Please stick around for fellowship. For the BAM individuals, we have extended fellowship time in the cafe that you can join us there for snacks and time to hang out with each other. Thanks again, everyone. Good night.</p></div></body></html>
