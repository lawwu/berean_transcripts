So it's either you're here, the airplane's about to take off, or you're there. You gotta be in one place or the other. He said don't leave them in between thinking that the plane is still there when it's not.</p><p>So in the introduction, Roman numeral one, don't feel bad for asking comprehension questions. Ask the unbeliever following questions. So remember, you don't want to sit there and use them as a wall that you're just talking to. You want to know truly if they understand what you're saying, and you want to be able to do that with good questions.</p><p>So if you use, we said this in the past, but try not to use the yes or no questions. Ask them questions that will force them to display or expose their heart a little bit. So you can ask, do you understand that, and then repeat what you said. So let's say you said you were talking about a topic for one minute, and at the end of it, even though they were nodding along, if you asked, hey, do you have questions about this, or do you understand what I was saying, you'd be surprised.</p><p>They might have been nodding the whole time, and at the end they'd be like, I have no idea what you're talking about. So it helps. Oh, what about it did you not understand? And they'll start saying, oh, you know, when you said this, how does this work? And then what happens is you begin to see where they actually are, rather than just assuming.</p><p>So A, B, and C were the first three points of the Gospel. God is creator and owner. He is sinless and requires perfect obedience. So you stop there. Somewhere down the line, and you ask, do you understand this? Do you have any objection to the fact that God created you?</p><p>Do you believe that? Do you agree? Or is there something about that that you don't agree? So you kind of go down these lists of questions. Let it be you're sinful, unable to save yourself, and you'll pay the penalty for your sin. Ask them questions again. And as you go through, you'll see that even though they conceded to some things, all of a sudden you find them back, like three steps back.</p><p>And you're like, hey, but didn't you say this? And then they're going to have to say, oh yeah, I did say that. And so you bring them back to the line. So what you're doing is you're trying to put the line here, and you're trying to move them towards the line.</p><p>And when they get to the line, you're trying to move them forward and get them to that line. So when you get to that line, reemphasize that line. So that if they drew back a few steps, then you say, hey, but didn't you say this? We agreed to this.</p><p>And you bring them right back. And you say, OK, now we can move forward again. Letter C, Christ, the sinless Son of God, paid sin's penalty for all who repent. Christ, the sinless Son of God, paid sin's penalty for all who repent. That's what we talked about last time.</p><p>Letter D, and here it is. Do you understand that simply knowing these facts cannot save you? Obviously, this is really tough to get to in what we did yesterday. Again, the evangelizing that's with the strangers, and you don't know how much time you have. It's hard to display this whole message.</p><p>This whole thing is actually most beneficial for what I would think to be relational evangelism. But here, you can actually get to those points, though, with people. You can leave and leave them, even though maybe even the entire gospel might not have been fully displayed, and you feel uncomfortable about that.</p><p>You can still leave them in crossroad questions. Do you understand that simply knowing these facts cannot save you? Do you understand that if you do not believe this, what the Bible says is that you are a hellbound person? And you have to say that very carefully and very gently and with care.</p><p>But if you do, this is where you ought to leave them. If this is what you want, because people are nice people. Most people you come across are people fearers, and so you can actually use some of that to your advantage. You can bring them to these places. If this is truly what you want, though, then you need to repent of your sins.</p><p>And while you don't want to leave them in that place of people fear, you want to bring them and draw them to a place where they fear God alone. It's still, when you think about being wise and shrewd, you want to use shrewdness in this, too. Use whatever capability you have, not to manipulate them, but to draw them to the truth.</p><p>That's a little bit tricky, what I just said, so be careful with what I just said. You're not trying to manipulate a person. But really do your best in that. I'll field some questions after this section. Instruct them to repent. So repentance involves confession of sins. Repentance involves confession of sins, and then repentance results in forgiveness.</p><p>Okay, Marsha, can you read for us 1 John 1.9? So we see that great promise there. It's kind of an if-then statement. If we confess, then He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Many people we come across will concede to some type of brokenness.</p><p>And if you can draw them to an understanding of sin, you can say, you can actually repent and confess right now. That's possible. And many times we feel afraid to get to that point, but that simple offer, people will take it. Because people are guilty people. Every person is walking around with guilt.</p><p>And so if you give them an opportunity, it could kind of come out in a favorable response. Acts 8.22. Is it important that it's a confession of sin, not sins, but sinful? Oh, I see what you're saying. So going back to point 2 of the Gospel in humanity, biblical anthropology would state, at this point, this is all assuming the previous points.</p><p>Just remember that. So this does not stand alone. This would be terrible alone. So with the understanding of trying to get people, everyone feels like they're sinful most of the time. And so trying to get them to understand, hey, it's not that you lie, it's that you are a liar.</p><p>It's not that you sin, you're a sinner. So getting them to that point will have already required you to have presented God's holy standard. It will already have required for you to show them you're so much worse than you actually thought you were. I think so. That's why this is really difficult in a cold evangelism setting.</p><p>So you have to make the call about whether in a cold evangelism setting you would still say this is enough to give them opportunity to repent of something. Because in a perfect world, you want them to have complete understanding before you get to repentance. But sometimes I will go to the repentance portion, and then as they're laying down their guard and saying I want to repent and confess over my sin, I'll take them back to a previous point.</p><p>I don't know how to explain it other than as you do this more and more, I think you begin to see more and more things. I mean, you guys probably evangelized way more than I did, I think. I mean, I'm 15 years into Christianity, which is more than I realize.</p><p>When I say it out loud, I'm like, "Oh, that's longer than I thought." I still feel like, in some ways, I still feel like a young Christian. But yeah, you just have to kind of, it's case by case. That's why evangelism class is a little strange. You're taking someone linearly through this thing that's nowhere near linear.</p><p>This is such a process. It's like trying to think how you would raise a kid. It's never linear. That's a great question, though. C.G., can you read for us Acts 8.22, and then we'll go back to Carmen for the next one? You know, that passage in John? This is a passage that I went back and forth in a lot in my previous years.</p><p>Because I got this, like, "Man, I grew up in such a nominal Christian setting that I felt like the requirement for Christianity, you know, the count the cost portion, was so astronomical that I really got that feeling of who then could be saved. There's a good part of that.</p><p>But then, in the midst of that, I think I really did forget the simplicity of it. Look at that passage. "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him, and believes Him who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed on in death into life." You don't want to make people run through hoops that you have created for them.</p><p>And because of my faithlessness to a kind of a degree, we might look and say, like, be very skeptical constantly. But honestly, we have to kind of recheck it sometimes and really think, "Hey, is this an opportunity where I could just say this passage?" You know? "Hey, if you're in some kind of brokenness here, but it says here, if you hear His word, and if you believe in Him, then judgment is gone." You can become a saved person for all of eternity, like in two minutes.</p><p>It's hard. Remember, we're not doing easy believism. That's not what we're going to do. But I think we swing enough on the cautious side for me to be able to say confidently to you guys, "Don't forget the simplicity of the Gospel." Let's see here. "Turn your heart from all that dishonors God.</p><p>Literally, repent means to think after. The Greek word metanoia is to turn." To repent is not to say sorry. Although that is very, very much involved in it. Actually, I like using the word sorry for people because repentants, they're like, "What's that?" They say, "Have you ever been sorry about something you did?" And explain to me what that sorrow looked like.</p><p>And so they'll say, "Oh yeah, there's this time I did this, and then, oh man, I felt so bad." I was like, "That's repentance." I was like, "What happened? Let me show you what repentance is. What happened after that?" They're like, "Oh, I felt so bad. I'm like, dude, I told the person I'll never do this again.</p><p>I got scarred by it. It was deep in my mind. It changed the way I live." Things will come out. So again, help them. Ask good questions to help them draw understanding. Isaiah 55.6. "Seek the Lord while he may be found. In good inductive study, what you want to do is ask the negative.</p><p>Why would he be saying this? What would happen if this weren't the case? What would happen if you don't heed this?" Kind of that negative part. It's like, "Seek the Lord while he may be found." That kind of gives us an air of like, "Oh, it's on me to go and seek him.</p><p>I have some time here." But actually what he's trying to say is like, "He won't be found for long." So you can say that to them. Luke 9.23. "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." Right. Man, we all know that one.</p><p>Luke 15.17, "The prodigal son." These are all opportunities to display the free gift of the gospel. Because it says in Romans 6.23, "For the wicked sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life." As much as we're saying, "Count the cost, deny yourself, take up your cross." I would say, always emphasize the "follow me" portion more than the "deny yourself and take up your cross" portion.</p><p>The "follow me" portion is going to cause the "deny yourself, take up the cross" portion. If we say, "You've got to give up everything and then here's Jesus." No, you want to lead with, "Here's Christ. Here's what you have in Him." And so when they look to their lives, all of a sudden, Philippians 3.7-11 happens, right?</p><p>They say, "Man, I count all things rubbish compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ." All of a sudden, it's someone who says, "I found the pearl of great price." Which is a story of the entrance into the kingdom, right? That's the story of a new believer. The person who is able to see something of such great value that they would sell everything that they have.</p><p>If we're preaching, sell everything that you have. Because there's like this thing here. That would be incorrect and improper. And we would have to say, "Man, what kind of Christianity do I live if I'm presenting it like that? Do I even value it?" This is a hard check. But this "count the cost" portion is very important.</p><p>Anthony, did you already read? Okay. Nicole, can you read for us Luke 14? [Luke 14, "Now great ministers, you're going along with them and you say that thanks to me, if anyone comes to me and does not believe in his Father and Mother and lies to him, he shall be his disclaimer.</p><p>But whoever does not believe in Christ, he cannot be my disclaimer. Whoever does not believe in his own past and comes after me, he shall not be my disclaimer. And if one of you then wants to build a tower, but not in this system, and calculates the cost, his condition has not been improved."] Okay.</p><p>With all this, this "count the cost" is so important. If you display that to them, you have to remind them that as they go, that there is a great cost. And fleshing out the cost, there's so many facets to it. You will have to display the church. You will have to display a God-centered living and all of that.</p><p>Next one, "Believe in Christ, follow him as Lord and Savior. Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." That's in Hebrews 11. "It is taking God at his word and obeying him." Repentant faith is not merely a decision to trust Christ for eternal life, but a wholesale forsaking everything else we trust and a turning to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.</p><p>"Faith is not a simple recognizing certain facts or exercising mere mental assent. This is more than just understanding the facts and assenting to the truth. Demons do that." In James 2.19. MacArthur says that in his book. So, you want to be able to kind of take them through this.</p><p>"It is a conviction of the truth that responds in or manifests itself in obedience." So, Jesus Christ is Savior. That's the trust portion. And Jesus Christ is Lord. That's the obey portion. Trust and obey. I love that hymn. "For there's no other way to be happy in Jesus than to trust and obey." Really, if you simplify the Christian life, I think it is trust and obey.</p><p>Some people will say love and obey. It's all the same thing. So, Romans 10.9-10. Whoever's next. "If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus is the reason in your heart that God has raised you from the dead to be with you today, so with your heart confess with your mouth the Okay, great.</p><p>Oh, Ephesians 2. Let's finish that up. Oops, sorry. I hate doing that with Bible passages. Sorry about that. Okay, so that belief is as simple as these things say, you know. Obviously it requires a lot of thought, but man, it's pretty incredible how, you know, John 3:16 when it says, "For God so loved the world that whoever believes in Him," like we get confused by our theology sometimes and we say like, "How does election and God, you know, His effectual calling like affect this?" You know, but the Bible is, passage right there, it's clear, "Whoever believes in Him," you know.</p><p>You don't have to present like, "If you are elect, then you know, like the opportunity is before you today." In our mind we might be thinking, "But if they're not a regenerate person, then can they really accept?" Like honestly, you can't see that. And that's not, those passages aren't meant to cause us hesitance.</p><p>Actually, many of the passages on election is meant to be the believers comfort. So when we go evangelize and we have those theologies kind of creating questions where they ought not to be, you know, maybe you should be more familiar with these passages that tell you, "Hey, this is a free gift of salvation.</p><p>Hey, whoever believes in Christ will come to be saved." That gives you the wings and the freedom. You're not an Arminian at that point, okay? Like at that point, like it's, you're a Christian, you're a child of God, you're a believer who is obedient to God's call to go and present a gospel that says, "Come all you who are weary." Right?</p><p>Anyone who wants to buy this milk and this wine, come, it's free for you. Like that's our message. That's why our feet are beautiful, you know, even though they're torn up. Okay, so appealing to the unbelievers will directly. This is, okay, this is important. So this is what you want to do.</p><p>You want to go directly to the unbelievers will and appeal to it. So don't appeal to their desired perception of themselves. Don't appeal to how they've been presenting themselves. Like try to go and dig in and now at this point you've heard so much about this person, right? You know a lot more about what makes them tick.</p><p>You want to go directly to their will. So if you look at this, if you look at the, "Who is God? He is Creator and owns everything. He is perfectly holy. He requires perfect obedience. Humanity is guilty. Everyone has broken God's law. The penalty for sin is eternal death and separation.</p><p>Good works or intentions cannot save you." And then, "Christ the Savior. Jesus came to earth as both God and sinless man. He came to show God's love by dying on the cross to pay the penalty for sin. Jesus rose from the grave and is alive today." If you sit there and you say, "Do you believe this?" And they go, "Yeah." They're not a Christian, right?</p><p>You actually have to take them through the repentance, the considering, and then the belief, right? So you must repent and believe. A) You can say this. Like if they say that they want to do it, don't get the false assurance of like, "Oh sweet, there's their believer." You know?</p><p>You have to say like, you have to turn away from all that dishonors God. Like will you do that? If they say no, then you're like, then like you haven't seen it. You haven't seen the full picture of all these things. Now they can say like, "Oh but like so I can't ever sin again?</p><p>I can't like ever struggle again?" Like no, that's not what we're saying. But right now, are you ready to surrender everything and turn away from everything that you used to live for? Because that's what's required to follow Christ, right? So it's, I don't know, you know, it's kind of like when you get married and what is that thing?</p><p>If you get divorced and you have the thing where that tells you where money goes and stuff? Prenup. It's like a prenup. It's like, wait, like so do you or do you not want to give your life to God? Right now though, don't worry about the future. Like where are you?</p><p>And let's go from there, you know? So from there you can kind of begin to describe what the Christian walk would actually look like and entail. In the letter B, believe in Christ as Lord and Savior. And you can ask that. Do you believe? You've understood now what Lord is and you've understood now what Savior is.</p><p>Do you believe that He is indeed that? Do you believe that He is actually Lord? You cannot make Him Lord, but right now what we're asking is for you to surrender before the Lord. Do you get all that? So clarifying questions. Letter C. And then, hey, will you repent and believe in Christ?</p><p>So if they feel like they're kind of rolling, keep it rolling. Like sometimes there might be times where it's beneficial to say like, hey, let's talk again next week after you think about certain things. But sometimes it's like just help them. Help them go, you know? It will make it easier in the beginning.</p><p>Ask, beg, command, persuade. Oh, so if it feels like they're walking with you in this, like so they say like, oh yeah, yeah, like I think I understand who God is. I think I understand that I'm a sinner before Him and that, oh, Jesus came to die on the cross.</p><p>And I think sometimes our hesitance and saying like, do you really get it? You know, that'll like cause us to stop. But keep trying to push them across those lines, right? So you turn and like say, hey, like today then, if you're saying you believe that, I don't believe that you believe, don't say this out loud, right?</p><p>But in my mind I'm thinking, I don't believe that you believe that until there's a response. If there's no response to it, then there is no actual belief in it, right? And so I'll ask the question, are you ready then to, if you say you believe these things, to turn from your sin and to abandon everything for it?</p><p>And you're like, I'm not ready. Then I say, then you don't understand it, you know? You're not, you're not, your belief is not real. Because belief is not an understanding of conceptual facts that I've kind of pointed out. And you feel even some layer of remorse inside of you, that's not belief.</p><p>You know, belief will cause you, like if you, if you're presented with something of such great enormous magnitude and it's offered to you as a free gift, like there is nobody that would not accept it. So there is some kind of obstacle here that's stopping you from taking it, right?</p><p>And so like these, these, like walking them down these things, will you turn from your sin? Honestly at that point they should be, like they should be able to, you know? So, you know, it was really cool. Yesterday one of our college staff messaged the college, college staff group and they're like, oh man, one of our students just like repented over their sin and they became a believer, you know?</p><p>Lord and Savior for the first time. And we're all like, like crying. I'm so happy. And so, you know, like, like I know that she had been kind of taking the student down for a while and some of our other students and staffers have been taking this student for a while.</p><p>It's Beverly by the way. But, and you know, she, she understood, you know? And it took so long. But constant crossroads was presented to her. Like we're making it very clear where you stand. You are not a believer, you know? And like even in her little group, they would all treat her as that, you know?</p><p>Like not very nicely, you know? But it was constantly that was presented that you got to turn from your sin. Like, like no, you're not one of us. And then she considered, considered, thought through it all and then, you know, she was asked like, are you ready to believe again?</p><p>And she did, you know, on Thursday. So it's cool. Like you're trying to move them across this line, you know? So does that make sense? To this, to confession, repentance, receive God's forgiveness, receive His grace. I think, I think a lot of Christian churches nowadays are so good at presenting points one, two, and three without helping people into an actual thing.</p><p>And so that's why it has caused the church to create many nominal Christians. That's why baptism has been a very watered-down and diluted principle or ordinance. And then I also think that's why people resort to quick fixes, altar calls, raise your hand, come up, pray the prayer, because it gives some kind of weird confidence.</p><p>But really to help someone see like this is what it's going to look like, like you have to receive it. That's why I like when we say then this next part of ask, beg, command, persuade, you're doing everything possible for them to receive this gospel message, like truly. That's, that's, that's, this is our end goal here.</p><p>Like we want to really get people, like here, we've been talking about all these things, but until you get to this fourth principle, like you leave them like on that fence, right? And so you have churches, you have pews filled with people in the middle ground, like getting convicted.</p><p>I'm not sure if I'm a believer, but just because they're like playing the game, it fools them into thinking, but maybe I'm okay. We need to be very clear like where this line is. And you have to, until you help them across this line, like you have to be very clear about that.</p><p>You are not yet a believer. You have to, you have to turn from your sin, you know. Okay, you can read these next three passages on your own. Now here's some questions that might be helpful. Earlier you told me your hope of eternal life was in the good work you do.</p><p>Hey, are you ready now or do you want to trust that God, trust God and believe in Christ? Another one, your faith was in yourself, but the Bible says that for you to be saved, you must place your faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. Will you repent of that and believe?</p><p>So you're hearkening back to something that they've already stated, right? You've said this, so this, right? Like it's a, it's persuasion at its best. You know, it's like we've already gotten here, so the next logical conclusion is here. Otherwise this thing, you haven't even gotten there, you know. That's what Paul does in a lot of his epistles.</p><p>He says, here you have all these things, therefore this is how you ought to look, this is how you ought to live, you know. It's like, oh yeah. So that's what you're trying to do with people. Do you understand what Jesus has done to save you? Would you like to repent and follow Jesus?</p><p>So warning, the sinner's prayer, you can go ahead and read through this on your own, but let me just point you to a few things. Oh, what happened here? Understand that the act of prayer does not save. Understand that the act of prayer does not save. So people are saved without praying, like the thief on the cross, and people pray and are not saved.</p><p>Prayer is not the switch that activates salvation. All people are saved completely independent of a sinner's prayer. There is no precedent for a sinner's prayer in the Bible. It is an invention of man. This is not to say sinners should not pray, but we are not saved by a scripted sinner's prayer.</p><p>We must not lead people to believe simply uttering a prayer secure salvation. There are some who offer the sinner's prayer on a piece of paper and they sign and date the paper after saying it. It's dangerous, but repentance will, this is Roman numeral two, express itself in prayer. Huge difference.</p><p>So people have taken point two and then created point one as a result of that. They've created sinner's prayer as a result of some kind of truth, but remember, B flows out of A. B does not make A. Does that make sense? Did I just do something weird there?</p><p>A relationship with Christ has begun, but salvation occurs the moment someone turns from his or her sin and places their hope for salvation in Christ. This is based solely upon the empowering work of the Holy Spirit and it is based upon Christ's finished work. A repentant person must understand that the basis for salvation is repentant faith in Christ.</p><p>Repentant faith will communicate to God in prayer. There's a clear prayer of repentance. I like, I really like having this one in my mind. I think it shows such a clear picture. Luke 18 13, "Be merciful to me a sinner." Ultimately that's what you want to see in someone in a nutshell.</p><p>Jesus's comment in verse 14 reveals that he was saved. Total abandonment of any works contrast to the Pharisee and crying out for God's mercy will bring salvation. Conclusion. Repent, which is turning from sin to God and have faith in Jesus Christ. Present the two together. Continual confessing or agony over sin without faith will lead to sorrow and mere legalistic resolutions.</p><p>Faith without confession is unfounded optimism that leads to self-deception. J. I. Packer says, "Mere credence without trusting and mere remorse without turning do not save." That would be worldly sorrow and not godly sorrow. Do not be juked. Do not be fooled by worldly sorrow. It is important to prompt the repentant person to tell God all they have learned.</p><p>Let them use their own words. So it's helpful. First quarter I took someone through like walking down the steps and helping them like if you believe this like you can we pray together and ask them to pray and I said can I pray after and then listening to how they pray will even help you see do they understand it's pretty cool but when you hear it like you want to sob like when you hear the real prayer you want to man there's nothing like it those are the times when I personally as a pastor in ministry it makes everything worth it okay well obviously we're not gonna do this so we'll give I wanted to do this with everybody so we'll do the activity next time but we're gonna do a different activity does any does anyone know what the order salutus is okay so this is called the order of salvation this is in Latin so I'm going to oh I guess we can't keep recording we have to try to place this in order okay so what do you guys think comes first in this list a different kind of quiz you can't get adopted into your call right regeneration I'll just go through it just see if you're right we'll talk about that okay so oh all right these are easy right predestined before the before the creation of the world Ephesians chapter 1 we have election also there that these happen concurrently when does the calling occur there's two two possibilities either from the moment you're born or sometime before you become a believer it doesn't happen before you're you're born though okay there's no calling okay and then there's regeneration so Karen you asked a really good question don't you repent and then you're regenerated but can someone repent without being regenerated can someone see their sin and cry out for God without regeneration this is like really let's like play with this idea what do you think about that this is I don't know so you would think maybe call okay cool yeah so the reason why this is really hard is because one two three four five this all happens in an sometimes in an instant so even though we're putting it linearly here it's just it happens but regeneration would still probably precede faith and repentance the reason for that is because this idea of effectual calling that's that right there effectual calling when God calls he needs to he needs he's calling someone but that person needs to have ears to hear and eyes to see before they can do anything right so in Ephesians 2 when it's an Ephesians 2 chapter 1 when it says you were dead in your trespasses and sins that you want once you once walked you know you were you were living in accordance to not all the world only but under its influence under its power under everything right and so then is there any ability for you to choose God there is it there is there any ability for you to to even cry out for a savior there is it right there might be something that echoes it or shadows it or is a shell of it but what we're doing that's what we're doing as an unbeliever every day of our lives we're looking for a savior somewhere you know and so when God calls then he needs to actually bring you alive in order to receive him you know it's a it's very interesting it actually is important without it being very it doesn't change much about how we live though right we have we have we're saying we're trying to get them here because we can't do anything about there right so actually we can't do any of that so we're we're hoping that God is using his words through us to call right that's that's our hope now this right here the reason why I bring it in today is because when we go out to evangelize this isn't the the our this isn't our anchoring truth this is our what do you call it it's not the truth that's going to cause us to move it's the truth that is going to cause us to persevere that's the way I'd like to say it okay so what I mean by that is like we're not gonna constantly think like ooh but you know like like how effective is our evangelism like what's what is the efficacy in this if if we're not if we can't see certain things right but for us we're saying that all we're trying to do is we're trying to be in the process and being used by God to to do this and then when we're trying to think about are they actually a believer we want to see like do we see some of these things happening in them I don't know if that was clear so let's use the word salvation and say this is salvation this whole thing like you a lot of people might even think here up to here at least right and this is like you know a promise but actually the whole thing is on that's why you know when we think of justification sanctification glorification many times we think of it very linearly God doesn't see it as such how God sees it all what's the passage but he says you have been sanctified right and that like throws you for a loop you're like what I'm being sanctified right he says you have been sanctified it is a complete done deal sometimes he'll say you have been glorified Ephesians chapter 2 is weird right because it says you were Daniel trespasses but God being rich in mercy because and he says you have been raised with him right and you have been seated with him up like you're like isn't that past tense that's a past perfect so it happened but I'm here and Jesus is up there you know it's kind of weird but it's because of the way God sees things versus the way we see things so we're trying to linearly put something into into play to see how kind of it works logically speaking but what we're saying is God when he looks at it he it's because of the gravity of the truthfulness of this character okay so when he says I will save you he sees everything instantaneously as if it was like done now right because it's that like it's as good as done that's a word that's a phrase we use right like even though like it's as good as yours even though I still have it I'm saying I'll give it to you later but you just consider it yours because like that's how good my word is here like for God it's all of that right so so the questions are really good but this is where I don't want us to be so so what I'm saying is like the reason why I point this out is because it is important but it doesn't we shouldn't be trying to think of this in the evangelistic sense but what with the reason I bring this up is because we this is what we're trying to hit I we want to see regeneration in them okay but we do have this past Friday we had a meeting after Bible study and what I was saying was hey there are people who like we're trying to get them to have faith and to repent right like we want to see that we can't tell them to regenerate though right but we can say like hey can you repent of your sin we can say that and so when you look at this it's it's really cool because I think there is a kind of sorry just five more minutes guys if you need to leave you can leave but I think there is a really secure comforting type of thought when you realize that maybe they are in the process of regeneration sometimes you get confused right you want to draw the line so clear that you're standing here and you're saying until they have faith and repent that they are not a believer but I think there's a lot of comfort to be had when you see someone changing and even though you're not sure and you shouldn't say they're a believer you can take take like man are they I might see regeneration right now I think that's appropriate to maybe like at least think about it sometimes that's what gives me that final like when you're exhausted in ministry you know we're all exhausted in ministry when you're exhausted hopefully when we're exhausted in ministry that's like that final push sometimes that makes me like go again and I go again there's like I'm like I feel like I'm seeing something here you know like and I'll pray God like like is that is that are you regenerating them and and so I'll go and I like you know try to try to get them draw them back to the line and see sometimes you'll get to that line again and they just completely reject it you know like sometimes like they'll crumble at that line you know and they'll move over and that's really cool and so and maybe this was a bad idea I didn't want to derail this but just just to kind of follow through God opens your eyes to see to give you repentance or a faith right and so you need faith even before you repent that makes sense right you can't repent unless you have faith if you try to repent in order to receive faith that's does that make sense no I think 50% hundred viewers and shake their head okay you need to have faith in order to repent because think about the words that happen at repentance dear God would you forgive me of my sin there is nothing good in me I need you doesn't that sound like faith that sounds like faith right faith actually leads into repentance and then after repentance justification we always think because of the Reformation during the time of Martin Luther this became the crown jewel of the Reformation justification and people say this is this is salvation and you would say no this is salvation if you say this is salvation man that is a one-dimensional salvation there's so much it's so much more than that there are so many more jewels like a diamond that'd be like a one-sided diamond right you want to see all the facets of it it shines like justification is great but I personally agree with the Puritans who believe that adoption is the crown jewel of salvation because if you think about everything you're all now we're we're not talking about evangelism anymore okay you know what I'm gonna stop I'm gonna save it so okay justification is paperwork in heaven and justification is legal it says it declares your edges and that's that's awesome that's like someone being in the court and then the judge saying you have to be right here to absolve of your of your crimes but you'll cry there right especially if like the destination of punishment was like a great punishment so if you can free from that but but that's it that's a moment in time where it's been like like in heaven says that you're declared righteous this is how God sees you know it's been nailed to the cross is one more but adoption is Wow like adoption you know I love talking about adoption because this is song that's saved into the kingdom of God and this is not your daily living this is your identity and no one's sister and my lives with the identity of just like constantly thinking like I've been absolved of all my sin and like the paperwork we actually like our daily living so that criminal was like not freed and becomes like all kinds from the record the way they live now is different you know and that's more like adoption and adoption describes is so great because justification will get into the kingdom of God but adoption gets you into the courtroom of his house you know it's like man I would love to get in as a beggar like the prodigal son says right so I just want to be a slave a servant in your household oh please you know I would beg for that but for him to say like now I call my son that's that's like tear-jerking you know oh man anyway and then sanctification obviously is the movement into that adoption says like this is this is who you are this is your identity sanctification will get to that no person you know we can't go into all of that so okay so something I did I used to do last week was to think about someone you're going to be sharing the gospel so what I'd like to ask you to do on the top of sheet five or evangelism custom of five that's the today's worksheet and you can you write down the name of the person and then somewhere we ran out of time so share with like a person or two who got like just the name of a person and try to try to get like a green next week a like a deadline for yourself so I don't normally like to set that lines on things like this but for the purpose of this class for accountability to you at least to get yourself out there into a place of an uncomfortable situation if you can share that deadline with someone so next week we're going to be moving very quickly please come very much on time I'm just gonna be forthright with you there is no place next week so just just do all the homework God thank you for so great a salvation God that the more we study it the more we oh man I just think you have adoption again thinking of everything you've done from the top to bottom to monitor just simply safely but there is there is nothing there's nothing I'm boasting for all of us God there is nothing that we can boast and you have saved and you alone and father that is our prayer as we go out that that this salvation has been given to us is something that we cannot retain inside our own hearts got it it needs to erupt out of our lips it needs to be something we live all our lives for we don't all need to be pastors and missionaries but God we do indeed need to pastor and we do indeed need to be mission and so father I pray for every Christian that we would go out to the ends of the world to share this gospel and God it will be very close to us as we talk to people and father that it would cause us to the fallen and needs to pray for the people that we share the gospel with knowing that you alone can save Jesus name you pray</p></div></body></html>
