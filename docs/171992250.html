it typically talks about His wrath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1552s">00:25:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember when Jesus says to the disciples, let me sit to the left and to the right, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1556s">00:25:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "Are you able to drink the cup that I drink?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1558s">00:25:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cup He's referring to is a wrath that He's going to take upon Himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1562s">00:26:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so He says, "The cup of wrath, do you not know that the cup of wrath came to you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1567s">00:26:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for a reason?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1568s">00:26:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then He says in verse 22, "Thus says the Lord, the Lord your God, who pleads the cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1573s">00:26:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of His people, 'Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of

disciplining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1581s">00:26:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But time's going to come when God's going to take away the cup, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1584s">00:26:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The bowl of my wrath, you shall drink no more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1587s">00:26:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though your sins are many, my servant is going to come, He's going to make His face</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1593s">00:26:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like flint, and He's going to go toward the cross, take our sins upon Himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1598s">00:26:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to be beaten by the multitudes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1601s">00:26:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to have deep fellowship with the Father, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1604s">00:26:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, He's going to take away our sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1607s">00:26:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the wrath of God is going to be taken away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1610s">00:26:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it doesn't spell it out here, it gets more detailed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1613s">00:26:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this is a setup for chapter 53,

most detailed description of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1622s">00:27:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus is going to do for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/171992250#t=1624s">00:27:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So how is this wrath going to be taken away?</span></div><div
