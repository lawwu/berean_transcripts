investing in a Bible program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=74s">00:01:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've gotten a lot of questions about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=76s">00:01:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I told you there's various Bible programs that you can purchase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=81s">00:01:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a Mac, a lot of the pastors like using the Accordance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=86s">00:01:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Some pastors, I mean, if you, typically the Bible program that is pushed to us at seminary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=92s">00:01:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is Logos or Bible Works because it's a lot more comprehensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=97s">00:01:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot more going on in those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=99s">00:01:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't recommend those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=101s">00:01:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I don't recommend it is it's kind of an overkill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=104s">00:01:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it slows down your computer because it's so huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=107s">00:01:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And because it's complicated, even a lot of the pastors don't like using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=111s">00:01:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If you know me, if it takes me more than five seconds to figure it out, I'm probably not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=115s">00:01:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">going to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=116s">00:01:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and that's how I am with the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=119s">00:01:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm kind of like that with the Bible program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=121s">00:02:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've tried using Bible Works and Logos and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=124s">00:02:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And in order for me to get from one screen to another and to do search, I mean, once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=128s">00:02:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you learn it, I'm sure it's easy, but it took more than five seconds, so I quit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=133s">00:02:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible program that I've been using all these years is probably the layperson's version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=139s">00:02:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I recommended to the church before, but I wanted to just kind of show it to you what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=144s">00:02:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=147s">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible Study, PC Study Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=150s">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They do have a Mac version of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=152s">00:02:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't have it before, so they should probably change their name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=155s">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's called PC Study Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=157s">00:02:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you did want to purchase it, I would recommend the lowest version because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=163s">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the highest version, 95% of that you will never use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=167s">00:02:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=168s">00:02:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's extra stuff like Spurgeon, all of his sermons, his entire life and his prayer and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=174s">00:02:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">everything he's ever said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=176s">00:02:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all in that program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=178s">00:02:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=179s">00:02:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You will not refer to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=180s">00:03:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the basic stuff that you need, most of the stuff you can find online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=186s">00:03:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, the problem with online program is it's limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=189s">00:03:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I said, if it takes more than five seconds to go from one screen and go to another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=192s">00:03:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">website to look something else up, and it adds an extra step that takes you 30 seconds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=197s">00:03:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to do something, if you're like me, you're probably not going to use it, at least not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=201s">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=203s">00:03:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But this Bible program is very simple to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Because typically that's what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2111s">00:35:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Do not provoke your parents to anger. Right? But why does he say this to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2116s">00:35:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">father? Not to provoke them to anger. Because fathers were given authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2124s">00:35:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Especially at this particular time, the children and wives did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2129s">00:35:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have any rights. So the father can, you know, the idea of being abusive at home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2135s">00:35:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you've been laughed at. That's what you're supposed to do. Right? In fact, some cultures today. I told</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2141s">00:35:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you the story out in India, that women and children are treated so poorly over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2146s">00:35:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there. One of the missionaries actually had to give a seminar about not beating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2150s">00:35:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your wives. Not the pastors that we work with, but it was another pastor group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2153s">00:35:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I was there helping and doing a hermeneutics training with them. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2158s">00:35:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">missionary basically says, "A good Christian, good pastor does not beat his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2162s">00:36:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wife." And all the Western missionaries, we just chuckled. Because we thought he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2166s">00:36:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was joking. He just kind of threw that in there. And then the response we gave, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2170s">00:36:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the response of the pastor was very different. They were confused. They raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2174s">00:36:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">their hand and then later on we found out that they were bothered by that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2178s">00:36:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the pastors went up and asked the missionary, and he asked him, "What if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2184s">00:36:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't listen?" And that was a very serious question. So I talked to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2188s">00:36:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">missionary about that and he said, "It's a big problem in India. Right? That women and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2194s">00:36:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">children are treated so poorly, you know, in that country. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2198s">00:36:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in the villages where there's people are uneducated. And so you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2202s">00:36:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at a culture at that particular time where women and children were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2205s">00:36:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">treated in the same way. Maybe even more poorly than cultures like that. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2212s">00:36:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">do not exasperate. Do not provoke your children. It's because the guy has all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2216s">00:36:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">authority. He has the upper hand. And our tendency is, if you have the upper hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2220s">00:37:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you treat the people who are beneath you? If you really want to see a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2225s">00:37:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">character of a man, see how he treats people that are clearly beneath him. See</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2231s">00:37:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how he treats homeless people. See how he treats people who are, you know, beneath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2238s">00:37:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">him. Or maybe if you're a store owner, how he treats the employees. Right? You see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2243s">00:37:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, once he has power and authority, see how he, what he does with that. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2249s">00:37:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he's telling fathers, basically, don't wield your authority and power. Right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2253s">00:37:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">provoking them to anger by basically being abusive. Right? Because he can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2258s">00:37:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">He can express his anger and beat them because they bothered him. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2262s">00:37:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no consequence, at least in this culture. And that's why he says, do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2266s">00:37:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">exasperate them so that they would not lose heart or be discouraged. Meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2271s">00:37:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're demoralizing them so that they have, you know, so they they're afraid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2275s">00:37:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that's why he says to the fathers not to do that. And then, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2285s">00:38:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth. So obviously, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2292s">00:38:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">application of this is a bit different than today. Today we could think of it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2295s">00:38:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">employer versus employee. And I think there is a correlation. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2300s">00:38:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between the slaves and maybe an employee, the slaves basically did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2304s">00:38:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have any rights. Right? The master owned you. Even if you were an indentured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2309s">00:38:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">servant for a period of time, during that period, you belong to the master. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2314s">00:38:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">master had every right over you. Right? So if you had a good master, you'd have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2319s">00:38:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good life. If you have a bad master, you would be miserable because they would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2322s">00:38:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">able to beat you. You know, senselessly, for any reason. And so it's in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2328s">00:38:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">context, he says, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2336s">00:38:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not, there is a correlation. But the application of this is much harder than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2342s">00:39:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the application of employee and employer. Okay? So just keep that in mind. There is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2346s">00:39:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a correlation. But he says, obey in all things on earth, not with external</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2350s">00:39:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">service. Here's one situation where the ESV just took it literally. He says, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2358s">00:39:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">service. And that's exactly what it means. Right? In other words, just work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2364s">00:39:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hard when you're watching or you're being evaluated. Well, when no one's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2368s">00:39:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">watching, you just kind of do whatever. Right? You take 50-minute bathroom breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2373s">00:39:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You come into work 30 minutes late and leave an hour early. As long as you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2378s">00:39:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not being watched. And he said, you're basically, as long as the boss is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2382s">00:39:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not watching, you do whatever you want. He says, do not, right, in all things who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2387s">00:39:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your masters on earth, not external services as those who merely please men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2390s">00:39:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as you're working and the only person that you're concerned about are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2394s">00:39:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">other men. Right? And as long as they're not watching, you're completely a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2398s">00:39:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different person. And this obviously applies in every situation. Right? If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2403s">00:40:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're a man pleaser, you're godly at church and ungodly outside. Right? If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2408s">00:40:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're a man pleaser. And you only perform when there's a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2412s">00:40:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">watching. But when nobody's watching and there's no consequence, you're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2415s">00:40:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">completely different person. Right? He said, not only externally, but merely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2418s">00:40:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">pleased to please men, but with sincerity of heart. Right? Fearing the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2426s">00:40:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So in 23 it says, whatever you do, do your work heartily. The word here for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2438s">00:40:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">heartily literally is suke. But all the translations translated heartily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2443s">00:40:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's the understanding of it. But one of the questions that came up is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2447s">00:40:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is verse 23 and 24, 23, 24, 25, is it speaking about slaves or everybody else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2453s">00:40:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In this context, it's specifically related to slaves and masters. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2457s">00:40:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why I say that is because he says not to do it just external service, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2463s">00:41:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do your work heartily. Meaning internally. Right? So again, if you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2469s">00:41:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">language, it's connected. As the Lord rather than for men. Not to simply be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2474s">00:41:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">man pleaser. It's knowing that, knowing that from the Lord you will receive a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2483s">00:41:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reward of inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. For he who does not, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2488s">00:41:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">does wrong will see the consequence of the wrong which he has done, and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2491s">00:41:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">without partiality. So another question that came up is when you're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2495s">00:41:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about the consequences, is he talking about eternal consequence, heavenly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2499s">00:41:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">consequence, physical consequence? Clearly the Bible says there is no condemnation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2504s">00:41:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for those who are in Christ Jesus. He's not talking about salvation, clearly. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2508s">00:41:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the book of Hebrews tells us that those who are his children are what? Are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2513s">00:41:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">disciplined. Right? So does God discipline sin? Yes. He says that. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2521s">00:42:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">says he wouldn't be a loving God if he did not discipline us. If he allowed us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2524s">00:42:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to just live in sin without any consequence, it may be proof that you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2529s">00:42:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not his child. But if you are a child of the sovereign God who loves us, he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2533s">00:42:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when we sin, we are disciplined. And that's what he's talking about. So is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2537s">00:42:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there consequence for sins? Yes. The Bible is clear about that. Okay. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/329734051#t=2544s">00:42:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">finally, masters grant to your slave justice and fairness.
