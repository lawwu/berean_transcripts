href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=8s">00:00:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, just a quick announcement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=11s">00:00:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Next Wednesday we do not have Bible study here because it's Thanksgiving week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=16s">00:00:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so next week we have a break and then the week after that we'll be finishing up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=19s">00:00:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 22.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=21s">00:00:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after that, December 6th will be our last session where we're going to be reviewing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=27s">00:00:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to be reviewing the 22 chapters that we went over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=30s">00:00:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be a little bit longer review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=32s">00:00:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But our last day of Bible study for Revelation is going to be December 6th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=36s">00:00:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the reason why we're finishing a little bit earlier is because our home Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=39s">00:00:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">study meets a week after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=41s">00:00:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we don't finish on the 6th, they will end up having Bible study during the Christmas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=45s">00:00:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that the week that they should be getting break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=48s">00:00:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So either way, it works out because we have only one more chapter to go after today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=54s">00:00:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this chapter and then Thanksgiving break and then the week after that, Chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=59s">00:00:59.040</a></span> | <span

church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=88s">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the opportunities that we can imagine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=90s">00:01:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You've allowed us to be able to be in a position where we can access all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=96s">00:01:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Help us not to take any of these things for granted, especially your word, that we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=101s">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">study it, meditate on it, and apply the things that, Lord God, that we are studying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=106s">00:01:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we ask you would guide us and lead us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=108s">00:01:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In Jesus' name we pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=109s">00:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=111s">00:01:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so for the next two weeks, as we look at Chapter 21 and 22, we're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=117s">00:01:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">at the new heaven and new earth and new Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=121s">00:02:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically it's a topic of heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=123s">00:02:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the most clearest and the heaviest concentration on the teaching of heaven in any other parts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=132s">00:02:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=133s">00:02:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously this is an important doctrine, an important part of everything that God has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=138s">00:02:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">been doing, kind of culminated up to this point to get us to heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=142s">00:02:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the doctrine of heaven probably is just as misunderstood as doctrine of hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=150s">00:02:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Because so much of how people imagine heaven is from the secular community, it's from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=155s">00:02:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the movies that you watch or from books that you've read or just generally from the culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=161s">00:02:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of Christians don't know the distinction between what came from the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=166s">00:02:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and what came from the secular world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=169s">00:02:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think it's important for us to understand what it's saying in Chapter 21 and 22.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=174s">00:02:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are obviously bits and pieces that are taught in other passages, but the heaviest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=178s">00:02:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">concentration, the clearest teaching of heaven is in these two chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=184s">00:03:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully as we're studying it, that you can decipher, maybe you had certain thoughts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=188s">00:03:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of what you were to expect when you get to heaven and compare that to what you were reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=193s">00:03:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in Chapter 21 and 22.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=195s">00:03:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Was that biblical or was that you get that from somewhere else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=198s">00:03:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I run into people all the time, whenever we talk about heaven, they think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=203s">00:03:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">"Yeah, when I get to heaven, it's going to be like this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=204s">00:03:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, well, that's more of our imagination than actual teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=210s">00:03:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=213s">00:03:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=219s">00:03:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's begin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=225s">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So new heaven and new earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=226s">00:03:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So verse one begins by saying, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=232s">00:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=236s">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever was here before this period, he says that the new heaven and new earth is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=241s">00:04:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">going to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=242s">00:04:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the final destination of redemptive history, new heaven and new earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=247s">00:04:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously everything that we've been studying up to this point is to lead us and get us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=251s">00:04:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to this point, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=252s">00:04:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So ever since the fall of mankind, everything that God has been doing is to bring us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=257s">00:04:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=259s">00:04:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the scripture says he's the alpha and the omega, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=264s">00:04:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the part of the omega.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=265s">00:04:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the final destination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=272s">00:04:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus himself said, now the significance of this, Jesus himself said that he was departing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=278s">00:04:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">from his disciples to go prepare a place for his disciples, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=283s">00:04:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So John 14, two to three says, "In my father's house are many rooms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=288s">00:04:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=291s">00:04:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=295s">00:04:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that where I am, you may also be."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=298s">00:04:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're studying today is a new heaven and new earth is where Jesus is preparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=302s">00:05:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a place for us, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=305s">00:05:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, in Isaiah 65, 17, it's prophesied, "For behold, I create a new heaven and a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=311s">00:05:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">earth and the former things shall

revelation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=318s">00:05:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">God has been prophesying this from

I may shake remain before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=328s">00:05:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">me," says the Lord, "so shall your

one more, yeah, sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=337s">00:05:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In 2 Peter 3, 13, "But according to his

language and that description has been implanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=349s">00:05:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in scripture all

that doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/243737032#t=357s">00:05:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And heaven is described as a physical place,

how much of something that you've imagined to heaven, is it consistent with what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
