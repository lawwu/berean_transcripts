Out of the, you know, you have the first entreaty with the demons. You have the second entreaty with the non-believing, garrisoned people.

Jesus clearly knew that the ex-demoniac wanted to follow him and learn from him and just be in his presence because there's such a state of thanksgiving that he wants to just show to Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=1315s">00:21:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a noble thing.

He had no questions. He didn't want to haggle with Jesus. He didn't want to lie to Jesus.

resurrect her from the dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2223s">00:37:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Love compels Jesus to continue on

challenged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2236s">00:37:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In a sense, for us to...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2239s">00:37:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How are we being compelled by Christ's love in our endeavors to reach out to those who are unsaved, to encourage those within the body of Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2250s">00:37:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we compelled by the love of Christ to do these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2256s">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, what we laid out before you here, again, in these events, is really a divine love story of the Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2266s">00:37:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this divine love story doesn't end. It continues on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2273s">00:37:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're going to take a little step back because there are some problems that we find in Jesus' hometown of Nazareth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2283s">00:38:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see in chapter 6, verse 1-6, that Jesus goes back to his hometown of Nazareth and his disciples follow him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2290s">00:38:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in chapter 6, verse 2, when the Sabbath came, he began to teach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2296s">00:38:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the people who were listening to him were kind of like astonished, but not in a good way, because they were wondering, "Where does he get this kind of authority?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2307s">00:38:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How can he do these miracles?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2311s">00:38:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, they start attributing back to his father, who, again, like I mentioned last week, there's a good chance that Joseph may have already passed away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2322s">00:38:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here we have Jesus being mocked, being opposed to in his own hometown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2328s">00:38:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And verse 5 is... verse 5 is really unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2334s">00:38:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because this is probably one of the few parts in the Gospel of Mark where it explicitly states that he could do no miracle there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2343s">00:39:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2347s">00:39:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine, I mean, Jesus lived there for 30 years before he went out and did his ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2354s">00:39:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He built relationships with these people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2356s">00:39:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He probably played with some of these kids that are now full-grown adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2362s">00:39:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps they had ailments, perhaps there was sickness in their own families, and yet Jesus could do no miracle there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2371s">00:39:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a tell-tale sign that perhaps even Jesus' own hometown had a similar condition to the land of the Gerasene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2383s">00:39:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same kind of doubt, the same kind of begging for Jesus to just leave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2389s">00:39:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we see in verse 6 that he "wondered at their unbelief."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2392s">00:39:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, that's a detail in the Gospel of Mark showing us the mind of Christ as he wonders at his own hometown's unbelief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2401s">00:40:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he still continued going around the villages and still teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2408s">00:40:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have his own hometown that's offended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2414s">00:40:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In chapter 6, verse 1-6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2419s">00:40:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any questions so far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2421s">00:40:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Please, straightforward, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2424s">00:40:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a controversial amendment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2426s">00:40:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2427s">00:40:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We go on to chapter 6, verse 7-13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2435s">00:40:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see here the first commission of the apostles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2441s">00:40:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get the cross-references in Matthew 10, verses 5-15 and Luke 9, verses 1-6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2448s">00:40:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the Gospel of Matthew account, there's actually an explicit command for them not to go to the Gentiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2454s">00:40:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an explicit command for Jesus not to go to the Gentiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2458s">00:40:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why did Mark not include that command in his Gospel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2468s">00:41:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think so?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2471s">00:41:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because he's writing to the Gentiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2473s">00:41:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Writing to the Gentiles, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2475s">00:41:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would have fit into his audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2478s">00:41:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They would have been questioning, "What's that all about?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2481s">00:41:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it doesn't mean that Mark is being unfaithful or not being true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2487s">00:41:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just means Mark is trying to accomplish his purpose in writing this Gospel to the Gentiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2496s">00:41:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we see that he commissions them to go out and to teach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2500s">00:41:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And says, "Wherever you enter a town, stay there until you leave town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2504s">00:41:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2512s">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so verse 12, "They went out and preached that men should repent."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2516s">00:41:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically Jesus is instructing his disciples, his apostles, that you will only stay in this town based upon the response to the message that you are going to give to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2528s">00:42:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That they should repent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2531s">00:42:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're not supposed to stay there if people are clinging on to them and saying, "We have a great need for you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2537s">00:42:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we see later on, right, in verse 13, "And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2545s">00:42:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're not to stay there just for the sake of healing people by casting out demons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2550s">00:42:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're only to stay there if the people there respond to this message with repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2557s">00:42:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, people might ask, "Why is oil involved in verse 13?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2564s">00:42:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Historically, oil was used for medicinal purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2567s">00:42:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also know in the Gospel of Mark, we have Jesus healed without the oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2573s">00:42:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that might not be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2575s">00:42:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So why was oil used to heal people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2579s">00:42:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My answer would simply be, it's a visible avenue to display a source of healing, which is the authority of Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2587s">00:43:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like the disciples were just healing people and not talking about Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2593s">00:43:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They taught about Jesus, and then they healed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2600s">00:43:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point of this section is the commission of the apostles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2606s">00:43:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point of this passage is to really show that the disciples engaged in the same work as Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2612s">00:43:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That the disciples were engaged in the same work as Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2618s">00:43:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the main point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2620s">00:43:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2626s">00:43:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2627s">00:43:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to conclude our study by looking at the story of John the Baptist and his end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2636s">00:43:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We see in verse 14 that "King Herod heard of it, for his name had become well known."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2644s">00:44:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The works of the disciples were becoming famous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2650s">00:44:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't just simply the works of the disciples, but it was Jesus himself, because the disciples taught that it was the authority of Jesus that brought about these healings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2661s">00:44:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so King Herod heard about it, and this man, King Herod, is Herod's antipas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2667s">00:44:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He is a Samaritan ruling Galilee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2672s">00:44:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you guys know a little bit of Israel history, the Samaritans and the Jews, let's just say they weren't best friends, even though they lived within close proximity to one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2686s">00:44:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine already how the people may feel knowing that a Samaritan is ruling over them, over the people of Galilee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2696s">00:44:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he wasn't really a popular guy among his people. He was a cruel ruler, and he wasn't smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2704s">00:45:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had many family conflicts, again, we already know some of it, being that he married his brother's wife, who was actually his niece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/42358179#t=2717s">00:45:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here is a man, Herod Antipas, kind of getting afraid now.
