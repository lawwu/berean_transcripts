One, just to walk through each of the day's events, and you're not gonna be hearing a full-out sermon. You're gonna be hearing just a devotional, mostly just the reading of Scripture and the passages that pertain to the day.</p><p>And so the pastors are gonna walk you guys through that from Monday to Wednesday. And on each day, we've asked just a brother or sister to come and share their testimony, how it is that they came to faith, and how has Christ changed them. And also included in that is what they've been learning just thus far, just in their walk with the Lord.</p><p>And tonight, before we actually go through the events, we do have a testimony that our brother Alex Lee is going to be giving. He is a dear brother. He's in the young adult group, has been at Berean, just kinda came right in the middle of COVID, and just really has taken it upon himself to be a blessing just to many of our brothers in the BAM.</p><p>So he's gonna be sharing his testimony, but let me pray for us, and then he'll come up, and then as soon as he finishes, we'll proceed with all the events of Monday. Okay, let me pray for us. Father, thank you for just gathering just your body on this evening to reflect, and that each and every day our hearts would just be softened, that we would be sober, that we would be both reflective and grateful, God, for all the events of this week.</p><p>We pray that as we hear from our brothers and sisters, as we read your word, as we sing, God, that our hearts would really be just ignited to worship, to long to know you, to make you known, and really to walk in the power of the spirit. So we pray for you to move and to speak over the course of this week, that you would be honored, and as you are being honored, that, Lord, your church would be strengthened and beautified even more so.</p><p>And so we pray that tonight, as we offer this time up to you, that you administer in and through it. We pray this in Jesus' name, amen. Let's just warmly welcome up our brother, Alex Lee. (audience applauding) - Hi, Berean. My name is Alex Lee, and I thank you for this opportunity to share my testimony.</p><p>My story begins in the South Bay of Los Angeles, where I was raised and what appeared on the exterior to be a picturesque and harmonious home. A loving family of five, marked by a father who ran a successful chiropractic clinic, and a mother who managed the daily affairs of the children and of the home.</p><p>A core set of memories of my upbringing involves my parents, who routinely host lavish parties and events, inviting many family members, friends, and acquaintances, some of whom they didn't even really like, as a means to parade their wealth and garner the awe, recognition, and even jealousy of those who attended.</p><p>In reflection, it is clear that one of the primary impulses that drove much of my parents' decision-making was a desire to erect what was a forged image of a perfect family, one that God and His providence would painfully yet graciously destroy. A major component of this family image was the commitment to operate as a faithful Christian household.</p><p>But the religious adherence of faithfully attending Sunday service was detached from the glaring reality that Christ did not actually serve as the anchor of our home. A growing disconnect between our profession of faith and the obedience produced by such faith began to slowly chip away at the facade, and it was at the defining moment where I vividly remember waking up next to my brother and sister, our mom having carried our bodies from our beds into the car while we were asleep, and having driven around the city in search of our father, only to discover him gambling with friends in the wee hours of the morning, that I began to tangibly behold the brokenness in our family.</p><p>This brokenness continued to manifest in intense and agonizing ways, reaching its apex with the divorce of my parents, fueled by my father's drug and gambling habits, and a devastating act of adultery for which our family is still feeling the reverberations of to this day. My mom made a desperate effort to preserve the scraps of what was left of our family, moving my siblings and me to Orange County with little to no money, hoping to start afresh and flee from a sinful and broken past.</p><p>But these efforts were in vain. Sin and its devastating consequences would continue to be a reoccurring fixture in our home, and the havoc that ensued for many years afterwards drove each family member to pursue the idols and lusts that captivated each of our own hearts. Though I was not at all academically driven prior to my parents' separation, this all dramatically changed post-divorce when our family moved to Orange County.</p><p>Desperate to build my identity on academic success, perfect grades and accolades became my sole obsession throughout middle school and high school. And at the expense of playing with a few friends that I had, I would often needlessly spend an extra hour or two studying for an exam. While the decision to attend college on the East Coast was partially driven by my desire to escape the toxic captivity of our home, it was also largely motivated by a desire to further indulge in my obsession with grades and academic success.</p><p>Throughout my time in college, I would often spend six to seven days a week in the library from morning to past midnight, feverishly working on papers and studying for exams. Whatever semblance of Christianity that was a part of my life had all but evaporated during those years. As I approached graduation, I grew in greater anticipation as my academic goals were soon to be fully realized.</p><p>And the security of obtaining a job on Wall Street in New York City only strengthened the conviction that my worldly pursuits that truly enslaved me were justified. That it was also precisely at this moment that the pitiful awareness that I would soon graduate with no friends to laugh, celebrate, and build lifelong relationships with that left a deep, nauseating knot in my stomach.</p><p>Yes, this sobering realization that graduation day for me would be marked by a sheer, uncomfortable loneliness drove me to make a decision that characterized much of the same decision-making patterns that defined my family's past. So a few days before graduation, I packed my bags, left for home, and attempted to look forward to this new chapter in my life in New York.</p><p>Meanwhile, trying my best to suppress the deep ache in my heart that told me that all was not well. This ache only intensified when I returned home, and it created a profound emptiness inside of me that could not be quelled by exam prep or completing problem sets. What was there to study or complete?</p><p>I graduated. But it was at this moment God moved, and his spirit began the active and decisive process of drawing me to himself. It was the summer after graduation when my heart was so far away from God that he miraculously and divinely made me stumble upon a four-minute sermon excerpt on what it means to believe.</p><p>I had never heard a gospel message communicated in such a way that so poignantly pierced my soul, and yet so sweetly filled the void in my heart that I could not displace. Yes, it was at this exact moment that God literally broke me, bound my heart to him, and revealed to me how desperate I was in need of a son, a savior for my soul.</p><p>I so vividly remember falling on my knees, crying out to God in tears, and pleading for the forgiveness of my sins through the blood of Jesus Christ. I had my personal Damascus Row moment that could only be attributed to God and his immeasurable mercy on my life. I left for New York City as a baby Christian, but one transformed by the relentless pursuit of a shepherd who knows and calls his own sheep.</p><p>And while I no doubt experienced my ample share of challenges living in the Big Apple, God would repeatedly draw me back to himself over and over and over again. He would not let me go. When I understood that saving faith is a coming, a receiving, an eating, a drinking, a resting, an enjoying, and being satisfied with all that God is for me in Jesus, the good fight of faith for me ultimately became a fight for joy, a fight for joy in Christ and not in the broken cisterns of this world that can hold no water, a fight that requires a daily putting to death what is earthly in me and dying every day to the things that will destroy this joy.</p><p>It's about the reordering of life's priorities so that I'm no longer seeking a momentary joy in this life, but a forever joy in the next. It's about discarding the old passions, dreams, goals, and desires that once dictated my superficial and fleeting happiness and instead opting for a more superior joy, a joy that is complete and lasts forever.</p><p>Simply, it's doing whatever I must to see Jesus for who he gloriously is and enjoying him above all other things. In retrospect, it has become clear and clear to me that God has wasted nothing in my life. In his eternal wisdom and divine providence, he uses the painful moments of my past and the scars that I bear today to mold me into a greater likeness of his son for my ultimate good and for his infinite glory.</p><p>I leave you with one of my favorite verses from Psalm 73, verses 25 through 26. Whom have I in heaven but you, and there's nothing on earth that I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p><p>It is my earnest prayer that I can sing these precious words with a sincere and joyful heart for all of eternity. And it too is my hope that this truth would forever ring true for our church as well, that God and Christ would be our portion forever. Thank you.</p><p>(audience applauds) - All right, thank you, Alex. You guys all know this, but the Passion Week is undoubtedly the most important week in all of human history. And it's a week that really defines God's relationship with mankind. It's also the loneliest week in all of human history where Jesus suffers physically, he suffers socially, he suffers emotionally, but more importantly, more than anything else, he suffers the agonizing separation from his father with whom he had enjoyed perfect union.</p><p>But on the cross, he was permanently separated. In fact, he was hated by the father whom he loved. And so this is a very difficult week to think through, to process through, but nonetheless, it's very important. And something that you might not have noticed before, but I put it up on a little chart.</p><p>This is such an important week that there is a lot in the gospel accounts of this week. In fact, almost half of the book of John is about this week, or it records things that Jesus taught during this week. Mark, it's about 41%. Luke's focus, though it is a little bit different, it still contains 27% of all the material is about the Passion Week.</p><p>And Matthew, about 35%. So if you just look at the number, like the amount of ink that's devoted to the Passion Week, it's pretty significant. So if you're reading through the Bible over the course of the year, if you're going through the gospel accounts, just be mindful that almost half of the time you're gonna be looking at this one week, okay?</p><p>And so today, I wanted to look at the events of Monday, and I'm gonna be starting with just reading through Mark's account because it does give us a lot of good detail. And then we're gonna be looking at just some of the specifics in there, and I'll walk you through those things, okay?</p><p>But yesterday was Palm Sunday, so I wanna start with a little bit of, just as a refresher of the events that took place yesterday. Mark 11, nine to 14 reads, "Those who went in front and those who followed "were shouting, 'Hosanna! "'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p><p>"'Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David. "'Hosanna in the highest!' "And Jesus entered Jerusalem, came into the temple, "and after looking around at everything, "he left for Bethany with the twelve, "since it was already late." So this is Palm Sunday, right? And then we pick up on Monday.</p><p>On the next day, when they had left Bethany, he became hungry, and I wanna pause there. Bethany serves as the home base. Presumably, we're at the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus for the duration of the book of this week. And it's about a two-mile walk to and from.</p><p>So on each of the days, Jesus goes from Bethany to Jerusalem, where the temple is, and back and forth, back and forth. On a couple of occasions, he stops to teach. But the road from Bethany to Jerusalem is primarily the road that is walked on the first few days of the Passion Week.</p><p>So on the next day, when they had left Bethany, he became hungry. Verse 13, "Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, "he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it. "And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, "for it was not the season for figs.</p><p>"And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples were listening, probably a little bit perplexed. Felt like, kind of mean. He's just cursing a tree. Okay, but it continues in verse 15. "Then they came to Jerusalem." And remember, it's about a two-mile walk.</p><p>"And he entered the temple, and he began to drive out "those who were buying and selling in the temple, "and overturned the tables of the money changers "and the seats of those who were selling doves. "And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise "through the temple. "And he began to teach and say to them, "'Is it not written, my house shall be called "'a house of prayer for all the nations, "'but you have made it a robber's den.'" All three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, all three synoptics have this in their accounts.</p><p>This teaching of having turned the house of God into a den of thieves, a den of robbers. And I'm gonna be walking with you briefly of why that's so familiar and why that's so significant. Okay, so this is in all three accounts. The chief priests and the scribes respond to this.</p><p>They hear this. They know that he's talking about them and seeking now how to destroy him, for they were afraid of him, for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching. And then evening came, they would go out of the city, and it doesn't say this here in Mark's account, but they returned to Bethany.</p><p>"This section, my house shall be called "a house of prayer for all the nations, "but you have made it a robber's den." It comes from both Isaiah and it comes in Jeremiah at one of the darkest periods in all of Israel's history, the time period when the people of God are described as everybody is greedy for gain in Jeremiah three and Jeremiah 15.</p><p>The priests are bribeable. The prophets prophesy out of their own delusion. The governors govern by their own authority, and all of them say, "Thus saith the Lord," and they almost pronounce a peace and prosperity upon all the people of God without really knowing the heart of God, and Jeremiah's ministry on the surface is very unfruitful.</p><p>No one pays attention to him. In fact, he is persecuted, he is imprisoned, he is mistreated, he is neglected, he is the crazy fool, and that's the context. And I wanna show you a section out of Jeremiah seven from where this is found. Jeremiah seven one, "The word that came to Jeremiah "from the Lord saying, 'Stand in the gate "'of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word "'and say, 'Hear the word of the Lord, all of you Judah, "'who enter by the gates to worship the Lord.'" So Jeremiah is being given a command to worshipers of God, and in this period, there aren't many, but they're called those who go to worship the Lord.</p><p>Verse three, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, "amend your ways and your deeds, "and I will let you dwell in this place. "Do not trust in deceptive words saying, "'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, "'the temple of the Lord.' "For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, "if you truly practice justice between a man "and his neighbor, if you do not oppress the alien, "the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood "in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin," and those are all evidences of a life that is lived abiding in the spirit of Yahweh.</p><p>Okay, so these aren't things that you do to gain his favor, these are characteristics of people who genuinely worship the Lord. Then, verse seven, "I will let you dwell in this place, "in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever. "But behold, you are trusting in deceptive words "to no avail.</p><p>"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, "and then offer sacrifices to Baal and walk after other gods "that you have not known, and then come and stand before me "in this house, which is called by my name, "and say, 'We are delivered,' "and that you may do all these abominations?</p><p>"Has this house, which is called by my name, "become a den of robbers in your sight? "Behold, I, even I, have seen it, declares the Lord. "But go now to my place, which was in Shiloh, "where I made my name dwell at the first, "and see what I did to it because of all the wickedness "of my people Israel.</p><p>"And now, because you have done all these things, "declares the Lord, and I spoke to you, "rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear. "I called you, but you did not answer. "Therefore, I will do to this house, "which is called by my name, in which you trust, "and to the place which I gave you and your forefathers, "as I did to Shiloh.</p><p>"I will cast you out of my sight, "as I have cast out all your brothers, "all the offspring of Ephraim." And then he says to Jeremiah, "As for you, "don't pray for this people. "Do not lift up a cry or prayer for them. "Do not intercede with me. "I am not hearing you." So the Lord has given his people over.</p><p>And the temple is soon gonna be destroyed in 586. All of the goods that are in the temple of God are gonna be carried away to Babylon. And Jesus is quoting this famous section of Jeremiah to say that this is gonna happen again. In Matthew chapter 23, no stone is gonna be overturned.</p><p>And Pastor Peter mentioned that yesterday in a sermon. You leaders of Israel, you scribes, you Pharisees, hypocrites, you who clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inwardly are full of robbery and self-indulgence. It says in Matthew chapter 23, all of this is gonna be done.</p><p>So there's a judgment that is declared. So Jesus enters into the temple on this Monday, and he does not mince words. (coughing) Things are gonna go down. Matthew's account, I wanna read that briefly so that it gives you a little bit more insight into what happens during that day.</p><p>And Jesus entered the temple, drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. And he said to them, "It is written, "my house shall be called a house of prayer, "but you are making it a robber's den." And this is the only place of the three synoptics where this is mentioned, but the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</p><p>So he's performing miracles even on this day. But when the chief priests and the scribes, they just got lambasted. They just got like a scathing rebuke from Jesus. And then when the chief priests and the scribes saw these wonderful things that he had done, and then from the day before, the children who were shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the son of David," oh, they became indignant.</p><p>So we're gonna see a growing hatred toward Jesus who hatefully spoke out against them, and it's gonna start building momentum into Tuesday and Wednesday, and then you know the events on Thursday, Friday, and Easter. So there is a clear standoff now between religiosity and the heart of God. So this is what happens on Monday.</p><p>There is a cursing of the fig tree on the way from Bethany to Jerusalem, and there's an explanation of it on Tuesday. Okay, so I'll leave that for, I believe it's Pastor Nate tomorrow. And there's a clearing out of the temple. There are miracles and confrontations in the same temple.</p><p>And then after this exhausting, probably tense, and very just not pleasant day in Jerusalem, they return to Bethany, and those are the things that happen on Monday. So Monday is not that positive of a day, but Jesus, it seems, draws a line, and that's the events of Monday. So my encouragement over the course of tomorrow is to just start your day.</p><p>The passages will be up via Instagram, on Facebook, just the events on Tuesday, and Pastor Nate will explain and just walk us through the events. Okay, let me pray for us. Father, we're very thankful, first and foremost, God, that you provide for us your word, and that in your word, we learn so much about your character, about who you are.</p><p>And in your word, we also see so much of who we aren't. And we're thankful, God, that you are a God of great compassion and love, and you are a promise-keeping God who keeps his covenant. And who pursues even the most unlovable of people. We pray that as we reflect on each and every day's events, that you would give us a greater insight into your heart.</p><p>Lord, would you become more magnificent and holy in our sight? And as we reflect on our own hearts, that we would be so broken and disgusted by the sin and the residual effects of sin still that reside, so that we would understand and appreciate grace all the more. We thank you, Lord, for our brother's testimony, and we know that there are many other awesome testimonies of your saving grace, your life-giving power.</p><p>So as we begin this week, just reflecting on each and every day's events, help us to be a growingly sober people, so that Good Friday truly would be good, not just in title only, but, Lord, in our hearts. He became sin who knew no sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God.</p><p>Help us to be awed, be humbled, and be overwhelmed with gratitude at those truths. We thank you, Lord, for tonight. We pray for just sober hearts, prayerful spirits, and joy-filled walks. We pray this in Jesus' name. - Y'all stand for our final song.

And tonight, I would like us to just share and pray together over this one question. In what areas of my Christian life and my involvement in church are more driven by conformity and religiosity than genuine heart of brokenness and worship to God?</p><p>And so I want us to take some time just to confess and pray for each other. Where am I prone to being just a performer? Where am I prone just to being a fake church participant? Where am I just man-centered in my participation in the life of the church?</p><p>Because those are the things that God doesn't like just what's on the outside. It's just a superficial performance is not something that he desires. So if you guys can take about 10 minutes to just share briefly, to confess, to pray together, and then in about 10 minutes, I'll come back up, and then I'll give some announcements, and then we'll do a closing prayer, okay?</p><p>All right.

The shuttle will continue just to be running until nine o'clock, so if you feel the need to socialize and pray with people longer, you can maybe bring your car over and then park it, but the shuttle team, they will end the service at nine o'clock, so please be mindful of that.</p><p>Thursday, we do have some spots available, so if you wanted to sign up for the Passover Feast, you still can do so, but again, the priority is gonna be for members and first-time participants, but it is a formal event, so for you guys who are coming, not like super formal where you have to wear tux, but like something that you would wear just on a Sunday that isn't like, no, some of y'all dress bad on Sunday.</p><p>(audience laughing) At least like a button, okay, and then like something that you would work in, okay, in the 90s, all right, so that's Thursday at 6.30. Now, here's an important announcement for Friday. We're gonna have a very, very, very packed house on Friday, so a couple of requests on our end.</p><p>Please don't come at 7.20. If you can, by all means, help it, come before. Straggle in before. Grab a coffee, bring your dinner, and eat it here. One, it'll help you come on time, and two, you're not gonna overwhelm the shuttle team, 'cause a lot of our parking spots are a little farther away.</p><p>The parking spot availabilities will be made known as we just progress over the course of the week via Instagram, Facebook, and then you'll have our brothers and sisters out there with me on stuff, like directing you, but they wanna participate as well, so if you guys all come early and you make them unnecessary at 7.15, that would be great, right?</p><p>So please do show up on time, and for the welcoming ushers to help them, if you come on time, because a lot of our church body is not here tonight, but if you guys can all squeeze in the middle and come up toward the front, it would help just with the ushering, okay?</p><p>So just expect Friday to be kinda busy, and there is communion, so please do prepare your hearts each and every day for it. We have plenty of help for the Saturday saucing and everything for the Sunday lunch, but we do need help putting all the lunches together, 'cause we are putting food for about 800.</p><p>So just, if you can help by any means, sign up, and even if you don't sign up and you can lend a hand between, after second and service, third service, please do so, don't just grab and go. If you're able, please do help, okay? Also, I did see a weather forecast that Saturday and Sunday might rain, so just in case, just kinda keep an eye on all the announcements, so if we need to adjust, so that you can get a heads up on that, okay?</p><p>Let me pray for us, and then we'll formally dismiss. Father, thank you for just this evening. I pray that every evening would be just filled with a lot of prayer, a lot of praise, a lot of reflection, humility, brokenness, but more than anything else, just a growing confidence, Lord, in your kindness.</p><p>It's your kindness that leads us to repentance. It is your grace that causes us to be saved, and that we cannot boast in any way, shape, or form. All this is from you and through you and for you, and so we pray that you would take the very center stage at our church every day for the whole course of this week.</p><p>We love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for just your provision of our church, and we pray this in Jesus' name, amen. (people chattering) (people chattering) (people chattering)</p></div></body></html>
