Okay, well, we'll give it a second.  We're having a fun time of technical difficulties this morning. First service was fine.  The live stream is.  >> DCA. >> It's D. >> DCA. >> DCA, Jeremy.  >> We're good? You guys hear that?  Yeah?  Okay, there we go. Let's try that again.                          >> All right, welcome, Bruin Community Church, those of you who are online, as well as the people who are here. I have a couple of announcements before we get started. First of all, our virtual VBS that's going to be on July 27th through the 31st, and again, it's going to start at 5 p.m. And so if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up as soon as you can. And sign-ups are going to be from now until July 12th. And so the contact information is Jane Shin. And so if you need emails, the registration is going to be on the church app and also on the Facebook. And so please do that as soon as you can. Secondly, on July 26th, we are going to be having an online Zoom members meeting. And so please mark that on your calendar. After the third service at 2.30 p.m., we're going to be having our members meeting. All right, before we get into our offering, again, we want to say happy birthday to Shane Chung, who's turning 5 this week. Happy birthday. Amelia Barless, who's turning 4. Happy birthday. And then Taylor Jung, who is turning 14. So happy birthday. Congratulations. All right, so let me pray for us, and then we'll have time of offering before we get into our main worship. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time, that our worship may truly be in spirit and in truth. Help us, Lord God, during these difficult times around us, that we would be grounded in Christ, that our thoughts, our emotions, our will may all be submitted to your word. Help us, Lord, to be a light, and what that means, to learn to speak as if you are speaking and to act as you are acting. We ask, Lord God, that this service would serve both online and physical presence, Lord God, to cause our mind and our heart to reorient in you. And so we pray for your guidance and your spirit's anointing. And even in this giving, I pray that you would bless it and multiply it for your use. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.  Good morning, church family. Let's all stand together as we worship our God.</p></div></body></html>
