href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1845">00:30:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I want to introduce them to you is because of the size of the church and growth of the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1851">00:30:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we weren't able to keep track, but we highly encourage you guys to read this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1855">00:30:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why there's only three, there's many good books to read,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1858">00:30:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">but the reason why we chose these three as the foundational books for our church is that if you don't understand it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1864">00:31:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">or if you disagree with it, you're going to have a problem or have a difficult time accepting why we do what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1872">00:31:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the reason behind that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1875">00:31:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to introduce you to these three books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1878">00:31:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">First one is The Holiness of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1880">00:31:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is from R.C.

God-centered worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1886">00:31:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically what that means is our primary purpose of gathering is not to make sure that your felt needs are taken care of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1893">00:31:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have the best experience in the church as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1897">00:31:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not our primary goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1899">00:31:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We're hoping that it would be a byproduct of what we do, but our primary goal is how do we honor God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1905">00:31:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">How does he desire to be worshipped?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1907">00:31:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Where it's God-centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1909">00:31:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Every decision that we make, every value that we have is God-centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1912">00:31:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this book teaches is about his holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1915">00:31:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">God established all throughout the Old Testament, even before Christ comes to be sacrificed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1920">00:32:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they needed to understand who God is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1922">00:32:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to understand why Jesus had to do what he had to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1926">00:32:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we have a misunderstanding of who he is, or lack of understanding of who he is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1931">00:32:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and because of that we have an incomplete understanding of where we stand with God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1936">00:32:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">then everything that we do from that point on isn't going to make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1939">00:32:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like kind of pouring water into a bucket that has a hole in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1943">00:32:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this book helps us establish that, the holiness of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1947">00:32:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The second book is from MacArthur, "Gospel According to Jesus."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1952">00:32:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And this book basically goes over lordship salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1956">00:32:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that the main reason why I'm introducing these books is because of the topic that we're talking about today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1961">00:32:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is about lordship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1963">00:32:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so once we understand our salvation in light of that we've rebelled against God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1968">00:32:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and God restores us, that we may come under submission again to worship a holy God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1974">00:32:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then "Gospel According to Jesus" is, salvation isn't simply that he erased the penalty of our sins so that we can live life freely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1983">00:33:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">According to the scriptures, that God saves us, that we may again serve a new master.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1990">00:33:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We were at once slaves to sin, but now he made us slaves to righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=1996">00:33:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this book helps us to understand, going scripture passage by passage, what lordship salvation looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2002">00:33:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Lordship is not mandated in scripture for justification, but true saving faith will always lead to Christ as Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2010">00:33:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what this book is about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2012">00:33:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third book is "The Master's Plan for the Church."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2016">00:33:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like, if Christ is our Lord, where does that get expressed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2021">00:33:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Primarily through the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2023">00:33:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">A Christian who says that Christ is Lord, and who does not understand or practice lordship in the context of the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2031">00:33:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is outside the body of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2033">00:33:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You can say, you know, I have this personal relationship with God, but if you look at the scripture carefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2039">00:33:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">where the expression of our relationship with God is expressed is primarily through the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2045">00:34:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything that we do is to be done through the church, whether it's homeless ministry, whether it's through missions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2051">00:34:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's outreach, community, family building, all of it was given to us that we may practice this within the context of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2058">00:34:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this book helps us to understand that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2060">00:34:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the reason why we've introduced this book at the very beginning of our church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2065">00:34:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to help disciple our church to make sure that we're on the same page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2069">00:34:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If you come with a different view, or maybe, "Hey, I don't agree with some of that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2073">00:34:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the main reasons why you may listen to something and then say certain decisions that are being made,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2078">00:34:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">"Why do we have to do it that way?" is because either you don't understand this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2082">00:34:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe you are in disagreement with some of the stuff here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2085">00:34:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I say all of this because we're looking at a text where Jesus is calling out people who are calling him Lord, Lord,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2092">00:34:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and yet not practicing. In other words, it was just lip service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2096">00:34:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In Acts 2.36, it says, "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God had made him both Lord and Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2105">00:35:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This Jesus whom you crucified, he was made to be Lord and Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2112">00:35:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not just our Savior. The reason why he's our Savior is because him saving us from our sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUoBgiLbgV8&t=2118">00:35:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">establishes him as Lord over our lives.
