Welcome to Breen Community Church. I think as you guys can see, you notice that we are BAM. Our singles ministry is up at a retreat, and so they'll be there, and they're having their own service there, and they'll be coming down this afternoon, and that's part of the reason why you'll see less people. There's over 220, 230 people up there. Was the cafe open? Oh, it was open. Oh, okay, okay, that's good. They were threatening us that they didn't have enough workers, so, okay. They were able to find more workers. We have an announcement from our brother, Teddy, for the fundraiser that's coming. - Good morning. My name's Teddy Shea from the BAM Logistics Team. We are happy to announce that the Breen Service Auction this year is taking place April 21st to April 27th, and the proceeds from this year's auction is going to the Korean Missions Fund for the summer. So just like in past years, we're excited to see what sorts of talents, what sorts of items, special boxes, baked goods, whatever you can think of that will be available for bid. Just want to let you know and remind you that it's the Breen members only, so if you want additional details, make sure you check out the Breen members Facebook group. So we will be sending out an email later today for you to be able to fill out the form and add all your details and your pictures. Also, note about the pictures. If you don't attach a picture, just like last year, I may attach a meme instead to represent your item if I can't figure out what picture you actually wanted. So just letting you all know that. Thanks. All right, just to give a quick recap, those of you who don't know what we do annually, we have a service auction, so it can be a product or it can be a service or talent or even babysitting or whatever it may be, and then the church members will bid for that, and then the funds that are coming in for that will be used for summer missions that's going on this summer in Korea, just to give you a heads up. This week, we have all church praise and prayer, so we won't have regular Bible study during the weekday, but at 7:30, and again, our theme this year is praying in the Spirit, and so we really want to encourage you that this year, not just leadership, but the church as a whole really focuses on growing in prayer. And so even this Friday, as you come, we want to encourage you to prepare to pray, not just come to pray, but I know there are some people who fast dinner or pray over other things, or sometimes they'll have a prayer meeting even before they come just so that they can have a better time of prayer when they come, and so we want to encourage you to do your best to try to come to that for corporate prayer at 7:30. This coming Sunday, not this Sunday, but next Sunday, at this time at 9:30, bring in babysitting, okay? So this is for children who are 12 months to 17 months old, so there's a new babysitting ministry that's going to be happening on the other side, and so if you come to the other side of the building, there's two glass doors that you enter through. That's the room that they'll be using, so they have, again, cushioned carpet, and all the other stuff is being prepared for that. So if you have children during this service between 12 and 17 months, next Sunday. And so if you have any questions about that, you can contact Sarah De Los Santos, and she'll give you more information about that. Next Sunday, at 2 o'clock, they're starting their Old Testament survey, so if you've signed up for that after lunch, come back at 2 o'clock to 3.30, and this is a six-weeks course, and again, if you haven't taken this, it will tremendously help you to understand the Bible, so I encourage you to take that class. And then finally, on March 9th at 9 a.m., we have all-church cleaning and maintenance day, so as I mentioned, more people come out, the quicker and more thorough we can clean the church, so if you're able to come, even if you can just come for a partial part of the day, most likely it will last from 9 to maybe about 12 o'clock, so you have the rest of the day to do something else, so if you can come, they'll have a quick meeting to assign you to different things that need to be done in the church, so if you can come, please sign up for that on March 9th at 9 a.m. Everything else, I'm just going to refer you to our website. Okay, this morning, after our offering, after I prayed for our offering, and after our praise time, our sister Tasha is going to come up, and she's going to give her testimony, and she'll be baptized this morning, so let me pray for us, and again, if you are not transitioning to subsplash, we encourage you to do that. We have one more month. We're going to give you a grace period in March, and then at the end of March, we will no longer be able to accept things through Zelle, at least on the main offering, or again, our offering box is in the back, and there's envelopes there, so you can drop off your offering there, all right? Let me pray for us. Father, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to be able to come and call you our Abba Father. We especially want to lift up our singles ministry as they are up at the retreat, and I pray that you will continue to bless them and unite them, that there will be true fellowship, Lord God, where they are partnering together for the purpose of your kingdom, that your grace truly will be sufficient, and that they would be sanctified, encouraged, and equipped for every good work, Lord, that you have called us to. We pray this morning for our offering, that you would help us, Lord God, to give it to you intentionally, joyfully, and may it be multiplied, Lord God, that it may be used for your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music continues) (gentle piano music continues) (gentle piano music continues) (gentle piano music continues) (gentle piano music continues) - Let us all rise as we continue our service, but before we do, if we could spend a few moments to greet our neighbors.

This next song is a new song called "Behold Him." And as we sing it, you will see that at the end of each verse and chorus is a call to behold our God. And to behold is more than just to notice, but it is rather to gaze and to look intently upon. So as we sing about His everlasting nature, His humble and compassionate love, about who He is, and His victorious triumph over sin through His death and resurrection, may it cause in us greater praise and honor to Him.

(gentle guitar music) - Hello, my name is Tasha. I am a student at CSU Long Beach. My testimony starts off like a lot of people. I grew up going to church, serving in the children's ministry, going to youth groups and youth camps. I was doing all the right things and believed that Jesus came down to save us from our sin, but it was all just mindless believing. I have gotten baptized before, the summer between seventh and eighth grade, but looking back, I did not truly understand what it meant to be baptized and the most important factor, I had yet to call Jesus, not only my Savior, but Lord over my life. High school came and I was constantly trying to find things to blame God for and avoiding my own sin. I blamed Him for why I didn't have the perfect family with two parents, why He let my biological parents give me up, money like all of my friends' families did, the list goes on. I was extremely ungrateful for what God had provided me with, allowing me to even grow up in a loving home that taught God's word. Going to college, God placed wonderful people in my life, exemplifying His love and mercy. I was learning not only that I needed to have faith but also what it means to walk with the Lord and surrender all things to Him. I was doing all these things and wanted to seem like the perfect Christian, but in the back of my mind, it still felt artificial. However, in my avoidance of self, I pushed it back and kept going on. I was comfortable with where I was. I desired things like relationships, praise from peers, money, and still cared about what others thought of me rather than God. I recognized all these things I desired but not of God and it was sin, but I still could not completely understand or forgive all the terrible things I had done. Talking with older sisters in church and AACF, I was challenged for the first time in my faith. I spent a lot of time reflecting over and asking questions. I was finally able to be in the Word, not just to gain head knowledge for when I'm talking to others, but to truly know who God is. Romans 3, 23, 24 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God "and all are justified freely by His grace "through the freedom that came by Jesus Christ." At this point, I was focusing so much on how I was a sinner and forgot the whole reason God sent down His Son to live on earth and eventually die on the cross. It was to save us from our sin. I had to die to myself and recognize how much I needed God. As I move on with life, I am constantly learning what it means to walk a Christian life as a daughter of the Father and I can rejoice in His love and the promises that He has fulfilled. He has shown me so much of my sin by constantly humbling me to what true confession and repentance is. I can say with full confidence that my hope is in the Lord and He is not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪</p></div></body></html>
