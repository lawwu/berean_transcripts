I am a student at CSU Long Beach. My testimony starts off like a lot of people. I grew up going to church, serving in the children's ministry, going to youth groups and youth camps.</p><p>I was doing all the right things and believed that Jesus came down to save us from our sin, but it was all just mindless believing. I have gotten baptized before, the summer between 7th and 8th grade. But looking back, I did not truly understand. I did not truly understand what it meant to be baptized and the most important factor, I had yet to call Jesus, not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.</p><p>High school came and I was constantly trying to find things to blame God for and avoiding my own sin. I blamed Him for why I did not have the perfect family with two parents, why He let my biological parents give me up, money like all of my friends' families did, the list goes on.</p><p>I was extremely ungrateful for what God had provided me with, allowing me to even grow up in a loving home that taught God's word. Going to college, God placed wonderful people in my life, exemplifying His love and mercy. I was learning not only that I needed to have faith, but also what it means to walk with the Lord and surrender all things to Him.</p><p>I was doing all of these things and wanted to seem like the perfect Christian, but in the back of my mind, it still felt artificial. However, in my avoidance self, I pushed it back and kept going on. I was comfortable with where I was. I desired things like relationships, praise from peers, money.</p><p>I still cared about what others thought of me rather than God. I recognized all these things I desired but not of God, and it was sin. But I still could not completely understand how someone could forgive all the terrible things I had done. Talking with older sisters in church and AACF, I was challenged for the first time in my faith.</p><p>I spent a lot of time reflecting over and asking questions. I was finally able to be in the Word, not just to gain head knowledge for when I'm talking to others, but to truly know who God is. Romans 3 says, Romans 3, 23, 24 says, I realized at this point I was focusing so much on how I was a sinner and forgot the whole reason God sent down His Son to live on earth and eventually die on the cross.</p><p>It was to save us from our sin. I had to die to myself and recognize how much I needed God. As I move on with life, I am constantly learning what it means to walk a Christian life as a daughter of the Father, and I can rejoice in His love and the promises that He has fulfilled.</p><p>He has shown me so much of my sin by constantly humbling me and showing me what true confession and repentance is.

I can say with full confidence that my hope is in the Lord, and He is not only my Savior, but Lord over my life. One thing, if Jesus is going to say something like that, there will be some description, right?</p><p>This is what made Him so great. He just says, He's the greatest, because He was a man of conviction. Were there no other people who was a man of conviction? Wasn't Elijah a man of conviction? And he didn't give himself to luxury. Wasn't Elijah, didn't he also live in caves?</p><p>Weren't there plenty of prophets and people who gave their life? Weren't there people who preached well and was able to do many great things for God? What makes judgment? John the Greatest. It doesn't spell out for us, but the only thing that we know about John the Baptist is his proximity to Christ.</p><p>It's his proximity to Christ. Everyone pointed to Jesus coming. John the Baptist actually introduced Jesus personally. If there's any distinction between anybody that was born, it's his proximity to Christ. And that's what made him the greatest. He was like the one, like... If you were to illustrate, like if you go to some concert, you would have a lesser known band come up and they would play to warm up the crowd so that the main event, whoever's coming, people paid the ticket to see, would come to see.</p><p>But his purpose is to open the act, get the people ready. Well, that's what John the Baptist was to do. He was come to do, to prepare the people so that hearts would be ready and receptive when Christ comes and they preach the same message. John the Baptist came saying, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p><p>Jesus comes and takes the baton and Jesus opens his ministry by saying, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And there was such a smooth transition, they couldn't distinguish between the two. And that's why John the Baptist was the greatest. Because of his proximity to Christ. Now, now we know why John is the greatest.</p><p>But he also says, but in the kingdom of God, he is the least. He's the greatest and the least. How is he the least? Who are the people in the kingdom of God he's referring to? He's referring to us in the new covenant. John the Baptist was a unique prophet where he stood between the old and the new covenant.</p><p>He was the last of the covenant, last of the old covenant prophet that came who physically introduced Christ. And then when Jesus shows up on the scene, he says, he must increase and I must. Decrease. And then he just disappears. So what makes us better than John the Baptist?</p><p>If John the Baptist is greater than David and Abraham and Elijah and Elisha, and then he ends it by saying, but he is the least compared to you in the kingdom. He basically said, we're better than David. We're better than Elijah. We are. Are we supposed to take that seriously?</p><p>Really? Really? How are we better than John? How are we better than David? As John's proximity to Christ made him great, it is our proximity to Christ that he's talking about. Not us, not our giftedness, not our talent, not our influence, but our proximity. It says in Romans 6, 5, for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be united.</p><p>We shall also be united in the likeness of his resurrection. So whenever somebody gets baptized, it is not just a cleansing, it is a union with Christ in his death and his resurrection. In 1 Corinthians 6, 17, it says, but the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him.</p><p>Again, in 1 Corinthians 6, 19 to 20, or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body, that you are not your own.</p><p>You have been crucified. And we belong to him. So what makes us so great is not that we were diamonds in the rough and somehow God was able to see beyond the roughness so that he can cleanse us off to see the inner value that we have. What made John great was his proximity to Christ.</p><p>And what makes us greater than him is the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. It is our union with Christ that makes him the least because he was a part of us. He was a part of the Old Covenant. Now, isn't that mind-blowing? That's why when John says in 1 John 3, 1, see how great the love of Father has bestowed on us.</p><p>I like the King James Version better when he says, behold, behold what manner of love the Father has given. In other words, take some time to meditate and think what it is exactly that you have in Christ that God looks upon us and no longer sees who we are.</p><p>That you and I have been clothed with the righteousness of Christ so that now when God sees us, he sees his Son. So he's not saying we're greater than John. He's saying his Son is greater than John. Compared to his Son, he's the least. That's what he's saying. Because we have been covered by the righteousness of Christ because of our union with him.</p><p>So if this God was willing to give his Son, how will he not along with him give us all other things? And that's why he says, behold, what manner of love the Father has given to us that we will be called the children of God and such we are.</p><p>And I mentioned this a long time ago. This is not from the Bible, but this used to hang at my parents' house when we were younger. It says, happiness is not having what you want, but happiness is wanting what you have. See, if you live your life, if you're thinking joy, satisfaction, life comes from having what you want, you will live your life constantly in coveting, dissatisfied because you don't have what others have.</p><p>But true joy is recognizing what we have and wanting more of it. Even though, I mean, that's not in the Bible. Don't quote that and say, you know, it's in the Bible somewhere. I got that from some clock. But it was so profound that it just kind of stuck.</p><p>And I think it's very biblical. At least the principle is so biblical that how can people who professes to believe this live the rest of their lives coveting something so trivial? It's like living in the biggest mansion and then looking outside the window and seeing that hut, saying, why can't I have that hut?</p><p>Why can't I have that hut? I see people coming in and out of that hut. Why can't I have that hut? While you're living in the mansion, you see Christians who live their lives constantly coveting trivial things is a sign that they don't recognize what they have in Christ.</p><p>They don't know what they have in Christ. How can we have been washed in the blood of Christ, the Son of God sacrificed for us, and we have eternal hope that when He comes, we're going to be glorified with Him and we're going to be in eternity in heaven forever where there's no death, no crying, no pain, that we're going to call Him, Abba, Father, and then to live the rest of our earthly life coveting, why can't I have that house?</p><p>Why can't I have that car? Why can't I have that job? Why can't I have this? It's inconsistent with what you and I profess to believe. Behold, behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us that you and I, will be greater than John the Baptist because of what He's given.</p><p>I pray that that truth would sink in and that we would live and worship God accordingly. Let's pray. Let's take a minute to come before the Lord in confession. Confession of where we're at. Confession of Christ. Confession of love. That this truth would continue to sink so deeply within that we would covet Christ more than anything else in this world.</p><p>Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray.</p><p>Let's pray. Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and the eternal love of God the Father strengthen, encourage, rebuke, and sanctify the church that we may all live according to the gospel that you've given us. May the aroma of Christ go with us wherever you send us.</p><p>Amen. God sent his son, then called him Jesus, he came to love, heal and forgive, he lived and died to buy my life. He died to buy my life. And all fear is gone because I know he holds the future and life is worth the living just because he lives.</p><p>And all fear is gone because he lives.</p></div></body></html>
