href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=220s">00:03:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The Gnostics, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=221s">00:03:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was the false teaching of the Gnostics generally?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=246s">00:04:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what came out of that was we were saved in our spirit and our flesh was separated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=253s">00:04:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">so we are saved in the spirit, but our flesh is condemned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=257s">00:04:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So therefore you can do whatever you want with the flesh.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=262s">00:04:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the logic that they used was since our flesh is evil and it is condemned, what we</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=274s">00:04:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so 1 John deals with that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=285s">00:04:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">one who is born of God, because that was coming from false

by the circumcision of Christ, how do you think the Gnostics would have taken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=302s">00:05:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=303s">00:05:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You see?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=308s">00:05:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says that our flesh is removed, so we can do whatever we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/320418153#t=314s">00:05:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So at that time, my guess is the Gnostics would have taken this and run with it.</span></div><div
