That's good. So it looks like you guys have thoughts to share. All right this morning then, we're gonna continue on in thinking through, you know, this idea of the very common experience of our lives. And how oftentimes, as we go through those experiences, it poses a problem for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=29s">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It causes sometimes a great amount of anxiety for some, and a great amount of stress and frustration for others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=36s">00:00:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's take a look at 2nd Rebubbles, over in Deuteronomy chapter 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=40s">00:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'd like to do is just read the first portion of it, and then we'll jump into thinking through the topic together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=48s">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm gonna read from verses 1-5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=50s">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Deuteronomy chapter 8, verses 1-5. And it's the Word of God says, "All the commandments that I am commanding you today, you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your forefathers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=70s">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=84s">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He humbled you, and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. Thus, you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God is disciplining you, just as a man disciplines his son."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=113s">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's take a moment to pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=115s">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our God, we pray that through the exposure to your truth, you would help us to have greater faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=125s">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord, that there would be greater knowledge and understanding of the realities of our lives beyond what we can see with our human little eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=133s">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I pray, Father, Lord, that you would grant to us a spiritual understanding of not only what we are doing in our lives or how we are to walk, but God, that our sights would expand to the knowledge of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=145s">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Lord, that we would be considerate of you, mindful that although we do not see you, we see your very hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more, we see your fatherly love, teaching, assuring, and guiding us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=157s">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We thank you, it's in Christ's name.

It's a grind for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my little subtitle to the series was going to be, "You need much more than coffee to get through."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=191s">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, as cheesy as that may sound, there is the pivotal point in thinking through, okay, here is the problem, here is the grind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=199s">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole thing about me bringing titles and subtitles to this is to kind of focus your idea on, what's the solution?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=205s">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, it's not coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=207s">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the solution to us making sure that we have the ample energy and sufficiency to get through difficult times, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=215s">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we're going to do is, again, we're going to meditate on the topic, I'm going to try to give to you as much as scriptural conviction, even personal wisdom, all kinds of things to think about a solution to our life, what's going to be a life-long struggle of walking through difficult times and seasons and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=235s">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want you to understand that if currently, here and now, you came to this retreat already feeling like work is a grind, maybe you've been in your specific job already six, seven years, maybe you are one of those individuals who have a job, maybe like accounting or something, where you're on the screen eight, nine hours a day, sitting the whole day, and there's this kind of monotonous work day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. We have lots of different experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you and I both know, all of us know, that this grind is going to be just one piece, is literally one phase of a life-long trajectory of things that will be difficult for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever next season you have, it's going to be all the more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=283s">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I did was I took a moment to describe the grind for us, meaning I wanted for us – the first point really is just to look at the problem itself, how we think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to see what other people thought about it, so I Googled "What is the grind?" And that's a bad idea. Don't ever do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=301s">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Laughter]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=304s">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "The grind is a provocative dance dance."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=307s">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Laughter]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I should have done better and just asked one of you guys, "Hey, what's hard in your life? What's difficult?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=316s">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, now, as I did talk to some people, people would say, "You know, what's really tough sometimes is when life – your own word – and the thing about it is people feel like they don't have a lot of time, and the reason why is because the week goes by fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=331s">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why the week goes by fast is because nothing different really happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=335s">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next thing you know, it's like two months can go by. What's new?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing. Right? It's like nothing happened except for what normally happens, and so that becomes a grind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=346s">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, I mentioned how sometimes that repetitive nature of a work life, for some, they love it. That's what they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're there because, "Oh, I chose to do this, right? I chose this job because that's what I want."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=359s">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, it's not so much the repetitiveness when I talk to some people. It's more so the thought that your work is fruitless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=367s">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My work can be repetitive, yes, but it's incredibly difficult to persevere in the grind when you think it doesn't matter much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=378s">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When it's not worth something to you or to other people, and there is a fruitlessness to your job, then all of a sudden, why even go in the next day? Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=387s">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the thought that comes into mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=389s">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, some of you have elements in your life right now where, yes, you are being fruitful. You are doing the things that you think are worthwhile, but it's so stressful because there's too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=401s">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, whereas the fruitlessness is you're working, but you don't really actually feel like nothing worthwhile is being done, the other side of the grind is there's so much to be done, you just feel stressed every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=414s">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a fact, yes? Where you feel like, "Oh, I might be working and working, but I'm always behind the ball. There's so much to do."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=422s">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you end up realizing is you're stressed because you feel a bit like a failure. What's more, you come home from work, and you don't feel like there's any time left for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=431s">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes, you even don't remember to put in time for God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=436s">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when I talk to people, I ask them, "Hey," I ask some of you guys, "To you, what is the grind?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=441s">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Dude, the day just goes and goes and goes, and there's no end to the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=446s">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, there's some of you, as soon as I ask, "What's the grind?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=449s">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing that comes out of your mouth is, "Oh my goodness, working with these fools. My office is full of incompetent people who don't know what they're doing. I have no idea how they got their job, and one of them is my boss."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=462s">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's sometimes the grind, where you have to put up with the ineffectiveness, you have to put up with the lack of competency of the people around you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=474s">00:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What a grind, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=476s">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of you is like, "I have all four. I have every single thing that you listed right now."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=482s">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=484s">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, as I look at some of you guys, I already know, because I've talked to you, that we're in a generation where some people, they have one facet of their lives that dominates their lives right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=497s">00:08:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=499s">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Glory shining on them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=502s">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry about that. I'm going to take it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=510s">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you guys have one single element in your life that's just dominating, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=516s">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether you are in an intensive school right now, and you took that track where it's just like boom, boom, boom, and you got to go, go, go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=523s">00:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just genuinely feel like, "I am being dominated by this one facet of my life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=529s">00:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so therefore, that weighs very heavily on you, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=534s">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually wears you down quite a bit, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=536s">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in that way, that is the grind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=540s">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, the important question to this is not just simply have you identified what are some of the things that are difficult for you, that is taxing on you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=550s">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's an important question I have for you right now that you need to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/397109964#t=555s">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to give you one minute to jot it down in your notebook, which is, so far, have you dealt with it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
