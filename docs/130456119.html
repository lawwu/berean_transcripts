But if you do not forgive other trespasses, neither will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=394s">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your Father forgive your trespasses." I mean, you can't be more clear than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=399s">00:06:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Our ability to be able to come before God and ask for forgiveness is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=404s">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">contingent upon our willingness to forgive others. In fact, if we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=410s">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">forgive, it says our very worship will not be accepted in Matthew 5, 23. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=415s">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you are offering your gift at the altar and there, remember that your brother has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=419s">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something against you. Leave your gift there before the altar and go first be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=423s">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. So He says, "Even our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=427s">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very worship and offering that we give to God," He says, "first go and be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=432s">00:07:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reconciled." It hinders even our prayers. Mark chapter 11, 25, "And whenever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=438s">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stand praying, forgive. If you have anything against anyone, so that your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=442s">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Father also who is in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses." We have all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=448s">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things that the Scripture commands and tells us that it is absolutely essential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=452s">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that Christians practice forgiveness. But the fourth and final thing that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=457s">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture gives us about forgiveness is forgiveness is ultimately, vengeance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=461s">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately is the Lord's, He says. Romans 12, 18, "If possible, so far as it depends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=467s">00:07:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourself, but leave it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=472s">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the wrath of God, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' says the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=476s">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord." So in other words, He's saying the vengeance and the carrying out of justice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=481s">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and judgment, that's what God does. No matter how justified we believe we are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=489s">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, everything that we carry out, our justice and our desire for vengeance is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=494s">00:08:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">always tainted by our own sin. Our own selfishness, our own pride affects proper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=501s">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment. That's why He says, "Vengeance is mine." On the contrary, it says in verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=505s">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">20, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him." He's not just talking about a stranger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=510s">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's talking about an enemy, somebody who has offended you, somebody who has wronged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=515s">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you. He said, "On the contrary, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him something to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=519s">00:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">drink. For by so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head." In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=525s">00:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">win him over with your kindness. That he may desire to hurt you, but you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=531s">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to reverse this curse by being kind to him. So what he means by putting burning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=536s">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">coals on his head, meaning that he just put him in a situation where he can't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=540s">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anything else. He said, "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=549s">00:09:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul says, he says, "As an apostle of Jesus Christ, I have the boldness to command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=554s">00:09:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you in the name of Jesus." You know, when Paul calls himself an apostle, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=558s">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like the general meaning of the word apostle basically means a messenger. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=562s">00:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not how Paul uses the word. When Paul calls himself an apostle, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=567s">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about a unique gifting, unique calling that was given to a very few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=573s">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">group of people. Now, there's a debate as to whether that's 13 to 12 plus apostle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=578s">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, or some debate maybe Barnabas was an apostle. So, whether you believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=582s">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's 12 or 14 or maybe even 15, that office does not exist today. These were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=589s">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uniquely gifted, anointed people that God used for that particular period to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=596s">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">us revelation of the Scripture, to be the first witnesses of Christ. So, when Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=602s">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">says in his letters, he begins the letters by saying, "I, an apostle of Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=607s">00:10:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ." He's not just saying, "I'm just a messenger like everybody else." He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=611s">00:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uniquely saying, "This letter comes to you with authority." Romans, 1st, 2nd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=617s">00:10:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, 1st, 2nd Timothy, Titus, all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=621s">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of these letters have a stamp of his authority. And so when he starts his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=626s">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">letter he's basically saying, "You need to pay attention to this. I'm not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=630s">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking as a man. I'm not just speaking as a messenger who has a message for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=634s">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you.

And that's why he puts that stamp,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=641s">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I, an apostle of Jesus Christ."

The money that you put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=696s">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in, they can take out, like that, right?

So, when a letter comes with the IRS, with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=705s">00:11:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the stamped IRS, you open it, whatever it has to say, and you pay very close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=710s">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">attention to what he said, what they say, and you have to reply to it. You say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=714s">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"We need these documents. We need to verify this." You don't just put that over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=718s">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there, "Ah, whatever," right? Because behind the stamp of the IRS, the US</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=722s">00:12:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">government stands behind them with all their power and authority. So, when Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=727s">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">calls himself an Apostle, he's not just saying, "Yeah, I get the title, I'm just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=732s">00:12:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">messenger here." He said, "No, I'm coming to you with the authority of Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=737s">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ." In fact, he says in Ephesians 4:11 that the Church was founded upon the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=744s">00:12:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Apostles. The Gospel ministry was first and foremost was given to the Apostles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=750s">00:12:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His authority. In fact, here he says, "I could speak to you with the authority of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=758s">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">an Apostle and command you to do this." And it's not like he hasn't before. In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=763s">00:12:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, often times you see him coming with that authority, because he needed to.

Remember, the Apostles actually had authority to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/130456119#t=779s">00:12:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">raise people from the dead and actually carry out capital punishment.
