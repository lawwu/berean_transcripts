And so one of the girls, um, dared to press a little bit further and I'm really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126698324#t=108s">00:01:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">grateful to her for this, but she asked, "Well, how do you know that you're saved?" And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126698324#t=113s">00:01:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">first thing that wanted to come out of my mouth was, "Oh, because I go to church." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126698324#t=118s">00:01:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then the youth pastor, Maria, the Sunday before had said, "Well, just because you go to church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/126698324#t=123s">00:02:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't mean you're a Christian."
