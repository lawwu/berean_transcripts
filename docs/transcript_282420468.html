Now, after this, the previous teams are going to go to a ceremony.</p><p>The ceremony is going to be a banquet for all the winners who accepted the prize and want to join in the party. But the Marines realize that they can't choose both Justin and God, after all, no one can serve two masters. Hey guys, let's celebrate our victory! Let's have a banquet together!</p><p>But not everyone accepted our invitation, how about we ask them? Hey guys, why don't you come out of your pity corner and celebrate with us? Why would you invite me? I cheated fair and square, but I'm so undeserving for this. Why are you being so nice? Yeah, why are you being so nice?</p><p>God invites everyone to the table, as long as you repent of your sins. Wow. Question, who's more merciful than God? Uh, me? False, no one is more merciful than God. God even beats Battlestar Galactica. And anyways, we can't serve two masters. Join us and we can teach you more about the Bible and Jesus.</p><p>You know what? You guys are right. I'm going to choose God over Justin because God always wins. Let's pray guys. Dear God, please forgive me for all the sins I have done. Amen. God is so strong. God is strong! Yeah, why don't you guys join us in our celebration?</p><p>Okay. Oh. I seem to be a little lost. Do any of you know where Breann is? It is I, Nemesis of Genesis. Wait, right, I became good. Because you guys know that I am following God now, right? I am no longer in the dark side. Because you guys know that what?</p><p>We cannot serve? You guys are so smart. Anyway, I came here looking for my twin brother. Have you guys seen him? Maybe. There is this guy named Andrew Chong. He is a little lost. Maybe you can help him. Hey! Stop copying me! Jesus! What did you make food? Pizza!</p><p>You are my brother! Wow, congrats Nemesis on finding your brother. Why don't you join us in our celebration? We are celebrating the joy we have of being on God's side because He always wins. Sweet! Thank you so much! Yeah, let's go! Alright, let's give them one more big round of applause for our good team.</p></div></body></html>
