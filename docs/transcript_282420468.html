But not everyone accepted our invitation, how about we ask them? Hey guys, why don't you come out of your pity corner and celebrate with us?  Why would you invite me? I cheated fair and square, but I'm so undeserving for this. Why are you being so nice? Yeah, why are you being so nice? God invites everyone to the table, as long as you repent of your sins. Wow.
