A-M-D-R-J. You guys know what that is, right? I am Dr. Jesus. 2,500, 1,500. And then that T-J in the middle, what is that? Tribes and judges. And then if you look at the blue, king split, and then the A-B-C-D, Medo-Persians, return, return, return, Greeks and Jesus. You guys following along on the letters on the top? And that E-A in the middle, you guys know that it's the war, Elijah, Elisha, and then the Assyria. And you know that that... What's the five R's? Rest, relapse, ruin, restoration, repentance, restoration, and rest, again and again. And remember, judges, 400 years, 21 chapters, Joshua, in contrast, 10 years, 24 chapters, six chapters, 24 chapters. And you guys know what R-E is? Who is that? Rehoboam. And if you guys did the kings in order, Rehoboam's Appa is G-G. Okay? Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram. And then you have Re-Ah. So Ahaziah, lashes, Queen Athaliah, Jehosh, amazing Uzis, Amaziah, Uziah, Jojo, Jojo, Jotham, Haz, a manly arm, right? Jotham, Ahaziah, no Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, and then Amun. And then who's King 16? Josiah. So you guys are following along. And that's gonna make a lot of sense when you read some of the prophets, okay? So you have Rehoboam, six is Ahaziah, and we're still in the divided kingdom. And then you have Jotham. And what happens in about 18 years from Jotham? 722 is what? Assyria wipes out Israel. And the last Jo we're gonna look at today, Josiah 640. Six forty is about 28 years from what being shelved? Assyria being shelved, okay? And then you end up with just one kingdom, and then Judah's gone as well. And then we learned the main kings of the north that we need to remember are Jeroboam, Baasha, Omri, Ahab is a big one, and then Jeroboam again. And then H is Hoshea, and he's the last one before Sennacherib comes and wipes out the north. Okay? The BCD poem. 612, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows. So you guys kind of have the 722 there, 612, what happens 612? Assyria's gone. What happens in 586? The temple's gone, and then Judah's gone. Okay? And we looked at, so the BCD poem, and what are the four books, well the six books, including Jeremiah and Lamentations, that are involved in this period, the BCD? Heads, right? Abak, Hakuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Z is Zephaniah. So Bak and Phan, that's how you can distinguish which H and Z they are. And then the Weyhah Jamin, just as a review, what are the books of the Old Testament that kind of coincide with that Weyhah? Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum. And we didn't do the pictures for those yet, right? So we're gonna wrap up books 33 to 39 today of the Old Testament. Okay? So this is Micah, we're gonna just get these out of the way. If you guys have your Bibles, I'm gonna do a little bit of an exercise with you, okay? Turn to Micah chapter 1, verse 1. In the past, you might have just read it and just glossed over it, okay? But now look at Micah 1.1. Micah 1.1. If you guys have your Bibles, Micah 1.1. Okay, I'm gonna read slowly, okay? The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If you had a piece of paper and you started writing out like what goes where, now you can kind of place this, right? And where is Micah? We are Jamin, right? So you can kind of place that there. Kings of Judah. But during this time, is Samaria still around? Yes. So kings of Judah, and which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. What is Samaria? Capital of the north. And what's Jerusalem? Capital of the south. Now you can read, 'cause a lot of the prophets actually date themselves. So you can kind of figure out what historical context they fit under, okay? So if you look at the picture, you see a mic. That's how you remember Micah. And that sun that's there with sunglasses, that sun, so people don't think it's like fire, represents day, okay? So the next few pictures, you're gonna actually see the sun a couple times. Day, so the day in court, all right? But on the title, I put Judah's day in court. But if you look at Micah 1.1, what does it say? The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. That's what you see, right? So why am I saying Judah's day in court? Because God starts out in Micah bashing Samaria. So if God says this, what kingdom is gonna be excited about Samaria getting judged? The south, okay? So they're excited. But God comes and says, "Jerusalem, you are even worse. And the only thing that's protecting you is my grace and my covenant to David." So though Samaria, the book starts out about Samaria, Micah goes into mostly Judah. And even there, Micah 5.2, he talks about, "Oh, out of you, Bethlehem, Ephrathah, there's gonna be a savior that's gonna come." Who's born in Bethlehem? Jesus. So all of these prophecies do point to Christ. But the book of Micah, think of a day in court, but whose day in court? Judah. They're gonna be judged, okay? So Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, but because I shared with you last week, Hezekiah, because of Hezekiah, Assyria couldn't conquer the south, okay? So that's Micah. And then for Nahum, there's a flood there, okay? And just think of a flooded Nahum. And Nahum is talking about Nineveh's destruction by flood. So what two books are about Assyria? We jam in J and N, but what's the J? Jonah. And then what happens to Assyria in the book of Jonah? They repent. They look like these great people who are very humble. But if you know the historical context, that's not the case. But what happens in Nahum, 120 years later, there's a prophecy of their destruction. But the thing with Nineveh is they had very high walls and they were surrounded by these waters. But historically, the waters actually just, it just started flooding. So the Babylonians came and wiped them out because the Assyrians were too busy dealing with the flood. And then the wall was not as high when the waters have risen, right? So with an overflowing flood, I will make an end of Nineveh, it actually says, I think, Nahum chapter three, verse one. Okay, so there is a prophecy of destruction by flood, which comes true historically. And this city was buried and wiped out until archaeologists covered it up a few decades ago. So what's Micah about? Judah's day in court, okay? They're going to be judged. Nahum, the flood and their destruction. And remember, historical context, we are Jaman, or Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and then the books that coincide with that, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum, okay? And we're almost done with all the Old Testament books in terms of the pictures. Here's a backpack, ha backpack. Okay, that's how you remember the picture. So this guy wearing a ha backpack, what's he standing on top of? A big tower of watches, all right? So just think of like a watch tower. And what is he seeing? Babylon is coming. That's what he sees. So he's complaining because Assyria's bad, even Judah's bad. He's like, God, your people, there's so much injustice. There's so much corruption. How long, oh Lord, must I cry for help? And you will not hear, I cry out to you violence and you don't save. Why do you make me see destruction? Why do you cause me to look at iniquity? That's verse three. Verse four, he says, therefore the law is paralyzed and justice comes up, is never upheld for the wicked surround the righteous and justice comes out perverted. So Habakkuk is complaining to God. And in chapter one, verse six, God says to Habakkuk, I'm going to raise up the Chaldeans, the Babylonians, and they're going to come and they're even worse. So Habakkuk is like, huh, but then God says, but the righteous will live by faith. So that's where, you know, the righteous shall live by faith. Is that a very important verse? Yeah, but in historical context, it comes out of Habakkuk. Bad goes to worse, but the righteous shall live by faith. And that is even applicable today. Christianity is becoming more and more of a scoff worthy religious paradigm. Is it not? But you who believe in Christ's perfect life, death, and resurrection, you who have come to embrace the gospel as the only way of being restored to God, the creator, you live by faith, okay? Regardless of what the surrounding situations dictate. So Habakkuk is about transitions and watchtowers. And then we have a few more, but I'm just going to do one more for now. Zeefanaya. Zeefanaya. Okay, he's fanning himself, he's not fanning himself because it's hot. It's just to, so you can remember the picture. Zeefan. And what's that in the background? The sun. What does the sun stand for? The day. So the day of the Lord is coming. So I'm going to read for you verse one of, if you have your Bibles, turn to Zeefanaya 1.1. So you can kind of see what's going on. Okay, Zeefanaya 1.1. The word of the Lord that came to Zeefanaya, the son of Kishai, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah. Is Hezekiah a familiar name? In the days of Josiah, the son of Ammon, king of Judah. What number is Ammon? 15. And what's the other Joe? Sia. Okay we're studying 16. So this is happening toward the latter part. So in that Hezekiah is probably the king. So Zeefanaya is a prophet, but who is his great grandfather? King. So he's royalty and he's prophesying the word of the Lord. And what he's prophesying in Zeefanaya is the day of the Lord is going to come and two things are going to happen. The wicked are going to be judged and the righteous are going to be saved. So what happens when the day of the Lord comes? The wicked are going to be judged, especially Judah. And the righteous are going to be saved, including the nations. So that's the message of Zeefanaya. The day of the Lord is coming, chapter two, the wicked will be judged, starting with Judah. And what is Judah? His chosen line, right? So they're going to be judged and God calls Judah wicked. But the righteous will be saved, including all the nations. So chapter three talks about the nations. So for the Jews, they should have picked up on this in the time of Christ. So what is Micah about? The day in court, Judah's day in court. Nahum. A flooded Nahum, what's Nahum about? Destruction in Nineveh? I'll try to remember. What's Habakkuk about? Watchtowers and transitions, okay? And then Zeefanaya, the day of the Lord. And what happens at the day of the Lord? Logically, the righteous will be judged and the wicked will be saved. Ah, you guys are paying attention. The wicked will be judged, including who? Judah. Why doesn't he say Israel? Because Israel's gone, okay? And then the righteous will be saved and that includes all nations who believe in the Lord. All right? So as a quick review, we see Genesis through Deuteronomy there. And then on the right, Joshua judges Ruth. One Samuel, two Samuel, one Kings. These are all historical books. Second Kings, what's Second Kings about, you guys? Two kings are sitting there on an isolated thing. What's going on? There's division, okay? One Chronicle, what's one Chronicle about? David, what's two Chronicles about? The line of Judah. And then Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther we covered last week. Ezra's about the rebuilding of the temple, which we're going to talk about today. Nehemiah is about the wall, which is about surrounding Jerusalem. And Esther's all about what country? Life in Persia. And then we're going all the way back to Job. Okay, that's written in the time of Abraham. Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon. Isaiah, what is Isaiah about? Weeping and then what's the latter 27 chapters about? Rejoicing because who's coming? Messiah's coming. Jeremiah, Judah has become rotten like a sash. Lamentations, Judah's gone. Temple's gone. Everything's gone. So the weeping that takes place. Rejoice, feel, dry bones will come to life because God's going to intervene. And then all of these, Hosea, Joel, Obadiah, Amos, Micah, Jonah, and Nahum we covered today. Okay. And then Habakkuk's Zephaniah is in this transitionary period. Haggai, Zechariah, we're going to look at today because we're looking at all the R's. And then you have your 39 books of the Old Testament. So just review when you can, just this timeline again and again, and you will start getting less intimidated by the Old Testament. Quick review. Split, two, 722, what is that? 930, two, the 722, and what's the two in the middle? Who do you think of? Bob Marley. We are diamond, right? Okay. Number four, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, Jonah, Ahab, I'm sorry, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum. And we looked at the poem last week. Can anyone recite it for like two cents? All right, let's do it together. "Soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows." And then, so Jeremiah lamentations, and what are the four books? Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah. And how many visions were in Daniel that you need to pay attention to? Three. So, statue, beasts, son of man. And this son of man is an important figure, right? So 612, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows. So, 612 is that A, 586 is the B, and then this, or the, and the B and the C are together, and then the D is a 586, right? So King-King split, ABCD, Medo-Persians return and Greeks. King-King split, ABCD, Medo-Persians return and Greeks. You can get the dates of the King-King split, no problem, right? 40-40-40. How about ABCD? A, B, C, D, no problem. Now these, we're gonna look at today. Okay, 538, RRR, and then 333. Okay? So you guys know what the Hallelujah chorus is? Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, right? For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, hallelujah, hallelujah. You know that, right? Sometimes it goes for 30 minutes at Christmas. Did you know that's actually Revelation 11, 15? The seventh angel sounds his trumpets and there's a loud noise in the heavens. And it says, "For the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our God and of his Lord Jesus Christ, and he will reign forever and ever." So that's the final cry in Revelation. But we're gonna learn a different song that'll help us remember all the details of the R's. I call it the R1-Hallelujah chorus. Okay, that's a mouthful. R1-Hallelujah chorus. Okay? So you know the song, right? You know the... (singing) Okay, so we're gonna do this, all right? Here we go. (singing) Okay, you guys got it? So, what year did the MP come in? What year was the first return? Okay, you're gonna start hearing my voice in your head. I apologize in advance, but God bless you, okay? (singing) No problem, right? So who was the king of Persia at this time? Okay, now you guys got that. Try not to look at the lyrics. Try to look at my face, all right? Second line. (singing) So what is the decree that was gone out? They're supposed to build a temple again. All right, let's try this. First two lines. (singing) Got it? You guys memorize it? One more time. (singing) Sorry, exiles go. (singing) They're supposed to build a temple. (singing) Okay? (singing) Got it? So, what book, what sections of the Bible talk about this? Ezra 1 through 6, all right? (singing) Got it? From the beginning. (singing) They're supposed to build a temple. (singing) Ezra 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. (laughing) 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2. So far, so good? Okay? And then 50K Jews returned to that place. That K stands for thousand, all right? So, I had to work out the syllables, so just excuse it. But just remember, all right? So, how many exiles returned? About 50,000. 49,697. Okay, so 50,000 returned to that place. And what's that place? Back to Jerusalem. 538, 538. So, what year is the MP? 538. Okay? Don't say 538, all right? There you go. From the top. Try to sing it without looking down. (singing) You guys got it? Okay. Now, the next verse, so that you know which two prophecies go with it, Hakariah. So, what two books? Haggai, Zechariah. Here we go. (singing) So, who opposes the work of building the temple? The Samaritans. Who is that? The Samaritans. Is that the Northern Kingdom people? No. 70 years, the land is barren, so the people come back and start living there. They're now the Samaritans. Okay? We are Americans. Right? Did you know when I was in Uganda, the airport worker saw my passport, was like, "Are you from China or Korea or Japan?" I said, "America." He's like, "No, you're not." I said, "What are you talking about, I'm not?" He's like, "You have black hair." I was like, "Oh, my goodness. How did I get this U.S. passport then?" Right? Because for him, for that person in Uganda, Americans are supposed to look a certain way. So, that definition has changed. Samaria is no longer the capital of the Northern Kingdom. Samaria is a group of people that just started residing in this desolate land. Okay? In the New Testament, that's going to change again. They're going to be half-breeds in the New Testament. So, whenever you hear Samaria, just know that that definition changes over the course of the Bible. All right? ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, the Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪ Again. ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪ And then the next verse. ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Yahweh comes and rebukes Ayah, hakariya ♪ Got it? And you know the tune. ♪ Shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid ♪ ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, temple is finished in 516 ♪ ♪ Hakariya, hakariya ♪ If you remember this really silly, dumb song, which in some ways I believe is divinely inspired, you will know what's going on in R1. Got it? Okay. Now, without looking up, let's try the hakariya again. ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, the Samaritans oppose Ayah, hakariya ♪ ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, Yahweh comes and rebukes Ayah, hakariya ♪ ♪ Shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid ♪ ♪ Hakariya, hakariya, temple is finished in 516 ♪ ♪ Hakariya, hakariya ♪ I was singing this to my wife, and she just rolled her eyes, but my kid started singing, "Hakariya!" I thought it was hilarious. So what two books of the Bible prophecies are about the first return? Haggai and Zechariah. And what historical book is about this period? Ezra chapters 1 through 6. And Ezra's not there yet. He's writing in retrospect. So shesh, bazar, and zurub, abelid. And there's another guy named Yeshua who's the high priest, but I couldn't fit him into this song, but just keep that in reference. So we'll try this song three times, just straight through both verses. And we'll go slow. Okay? You guys ready? ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Cyrus, let the exiles go ♪ ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪  You guys are singing with such serious faces. They're supposed to build a temple. ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Ezra, one, two, three, four, five, and six ♪ ♪ Five, three, ocho ♪ ♪ Fifty K.

Oh my goodness, I'm making such a fool of myself. And this is recorded for everyone in the world to see. All right, so, you guys got the details? Okay, let's think through the song again. What year does the first return happen? 538. And what's their main responsibility? To rebuild the temple. But what gets in the way? Who opposes them? The Samaritans. But God rebukes them, and he inspires Haggai and Zechariah to preach into the situation. Shesh bazar and Zerubbabel get recharged and revamped. And then 20 years after they started this project, the work is finished in 516. And that's all you really need to remember for R1. How many exiles returned? About 50,000. That's a minority of the people who are in, of the Jews. Okay, that's not a lot of people. All right? So, Haggai, Hag-ai. So, he is holding the eye. It has nothing to do with the theme. It's just how you remember the book. And there's a temple in the background, not at the front. So, is the temple a priority for the people of God or not? It's not. Haggai is actually speaking a lot into even our context today. Is it time for you, yourselves, to live in paneled houses while my house remains a ruin, Haggai 1-4? Now, you kind of know the context. The people, first of all, got opposed. So, they're like, "Dude, God, if you told us and gave us this task, why did you not make it easier? The Samaritans are here opposing us. They're killing us. They're hurting us. Like, we have our children's mouths to feed. We can't work on the temple." And then Haggai and Zechariah, God speaks to them and says, "Is it really--like, why do you think I've sent blithe and judgment? Because you guys are not focused on what you're supposed to do." That speaks a lot into our context today. What's our priority to build the kingdom of God? But we get sidetracked by opposition. We get sidetracked by disdirection. We get sidetracked into building our own paneled houses. So, it has a lot to say into our context. Now you know the historical background. So, rebuilding a new temple. And Zechariah--Zechariah is about the kingdom of the Messiah that is to come. And what happens when this Messiah comes? He brings a different temple. Okay? And it is in the form of the body. It is also now in the form of a future temple that is to be built. So, Zechariah, the kingdom of the Messiah, yet to come. Now, we're looking at the first R. References, Ezra, 1 through 6. This is all on there for you. It's a little small print, but-- Is it okay? The print's okay? Oh, I gave you blanks. Yeah. So, what's the date of this? 5302. Okay? 538. What's the references for this? Ezra's 1 through 6. Who are the leaders? You have Shesh-Bazar, Zerubbabel, and Yeshua, who is the high priest. He's the religious leader. Okay? So, later, the religious leader for R3 is actually Ezra. Okay? But in this first wave, it's Yeshua. Zerubbabel is actually the David's line. So, he's actually the--he's not a king because the king position's gone away, but he's royal line. He's a governor. Oops. And then, what are the--who's a Persian king? Cyrus. And then, what happens? First of all, Cyrus--Cyrus lets out a decree, Ezra 1-1. In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, King Cyrus sent a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and to fulfill the word of Jeremiah, and he put it in writing. And what are the things that he put in writing? One, as many as wished could return. So, whoever wants to go back, you all go back. But how many people return? Only 50,000. Okay? Because 70 years is a long time away from home. And so, Jerusalem is not my home. It's my great-grandfather's home. I don't want to go to Jerusalem. But only 50,000 went back. So, the temple can be rebuilt, partially financed by the royal treasury. We will give you money to do this. And then, the goblets and then all the dishware and all the stuff that they took away from Solomon's temple, Cyrus returned it. Actually, if you guys know the story of Daniel, you know at the end of Daniel, King Belteshazzar sees on the wall a hand, the writing on the wall, right?  Like, what does this mean? Today, the country is going to be taken out of your hands. And Belteshazzar was holding a party, and he was drinking out of the holy -- what do you call it? Not goblet. Holy grail? He was drinking out of this stuff. And King Cyrus, who's righteous, he actually sends all of the articles that were taken out of the temple back. He says, "You can take all of this back and put these in your new temple." So, how many people returned? 49,697. And what are the things that happened? The temple was begun and sacrifices were made, but Ezra 3-3, they were scared. They've come back into this ghetto wilderness. There's nothing. And now, they're like, they have no wall, they have no enclosure, so they're scared that they're going to get attacked. So, they actually set up the altar and make sacrifices day and night. Ezra 3-3, all right? The altar was established on its foundation for the people who were afraid because of the people of the land. They offer burnt offerings to the Lord morning and night. Burnt offerings morning and evening. So, that's what it says, Ezra 3-3. And so, like, they're scared. They don't know what to do. But the temple is begun. The Feast of Tabernacles is celebrated. The Samaritans make trouble. And for the next 18 years, nothing's being done. And then Haggai and Zechariah come, and then the temple is completed in 516. So, the themes for Haggai and Zechariah is a call, really, to complete the reconstruction, the future restoration through Messiah. The pictures, like, the wording is very similar. Ezra 5-1, if you look back here, now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Edo. In the book of Zechariah, it actually says a son of Berechiah. So, Edo is actually his grandfather. Prophecy to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of God of Israel, who is over them. But, you know, when they first started building this temple, look what happens.
