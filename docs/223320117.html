if you remember, if we look at chapter six, the seal judgments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=78s">00:01:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">were opened up and it went up to the sixth seal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=83s">00:01:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, like part of the thing that I asked you to observe is when these seals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=88s">00:01:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">were being opened, what was the progression of these judgments?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=94s">00:01:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Were they getting lighter or harsher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=97s">00:01:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Harsher, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=100s">00:01:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in each one of these, with the exception of the fifth one, the fifth one explains about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=106s">00:01:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the martyrs who are under the altar basically as an act of sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=111s">00:01:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seal, each one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=115s">00:01:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">these seals elevates this judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=117s">00:01:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's chapter seven is kind of like a parenthetical statement where it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=123s">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not necessarily taking a break, but it opens up the sixth seal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=126s">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But before it gets to the seventh seal, and with seventh seal, I asked you to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=131s">00:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">look at to see if that's opening up and within the seventh seal, the other judgment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=137s">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the trumpet judgments, and then within the seventh trumpet, the bowl judgment is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=141s">00:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or whether that's consecutive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=144s">00:02:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever the case is, again, we're going to be looking at that in the coming weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=148s">00:02:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but before the seventh seal gets opened up in chapter eight, the sixth seal opens up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=153s">00:02:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then what we are seeing in chapter seven is happening within the sixth seal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=160s">00:02:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's an escalation of what's happening in these judgments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=165s">00:02:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember we talked about that last week, like we study these things kind of to observe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=169s">00:02:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like what

Jews and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=1325s">00:22:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the 12 tribes, this can't be the literal

then verse 9 and on is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=1359s">00:22:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the church, how do you make this

is that this is talking about a part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/223320117#t=1367s">00:22:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of the church who's been
