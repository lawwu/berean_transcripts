there is this and if there's any of that," and so that's why I say verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360972455#t=227s">00:03:47.840</a></span> | <span

meaning the highest example we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/360972455#t=259s">00:04:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have, which is Jesus
