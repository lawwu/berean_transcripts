He's better than the prophets." We've been talking about how he's better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=175s">00:02:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the angels, and all of it to conclude in chapter 2, where he says, "Therefore, we must pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=180s">00:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">very close attention so we do not drift." We've been talking last week that this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=186s">00:03:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">part two of this same text in verse 4 to verse 14, how Jesus is superior to the angels, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=193s">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he is above them. He's not just slightly above, it says, the first thing that he says, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=199s">00:03:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">narrated a much more excellent name than the angels, that's very nature of who he is, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=207s">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">much higher than any other name. And then in verse 6 he says the angels were actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=212s">00:03:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">called to worship Jesus. Today we're going to be looking at third and fourth argument,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=219s">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and next week we're going to be looking at the fifth and sixth argument. But this question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=225s">00:03:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of, "Is Jesus better?" is a question that every Christian has to ask repeatedly over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=232s">00:03:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and over again in different periods of our life. I remember when I first decided and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=238s">00:03:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was wrestling with the idea of going into ministry, one of the first things that I wrestled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=242s">00:04:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">with was I had to let go of all the promises that I made to my parents. My dad was a pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=250s">00:04:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and we moved around a lot, and financially it was always tough. I can't remember a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=256s">00:04:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">year after coming to the United States where it wasn't tough financially. So I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=260s">00:04:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">growing up thinking, "When I get older, I'm going to be a successful businessman," and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=266s">00:04:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we would make promises like a lot of young kids do, say, "We're going to buy you a limousine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=271s">00:04:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to buy you a house. Once we get older, we're going to take care of you," and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=276s">00:04:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we would make these promises. And I really meant it in my heart that once I got older</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=281s">00:04:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and got a job that I was going to provide. So when I decided to go into ministry, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=288s">00:04:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was the first thing that I had to wrestle with. "Is Jesus better than my parents?" Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=294s">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to let that go. Few years later, back inside, when we were in college ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=301s">00:05:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it was the first time in Biola I ever felt like I belonged anywhere as a Christian, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=306s">00:05:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">even as a non-Christian, because we moved around somewhere so much. And so when I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=311s">00:05:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a group of friends that we were doing ministry together in this campus ministry, again, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=317s">00:05:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was the first time I ever felt like I was part of a community. About seven, eight months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=322s">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">into it, something happened in the ministry and all of my friends, I mean, I'm talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=325s">00:05:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about every single one of them, all of my peers ended up leaving the ministry. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=330s">00:05:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">why even to this day, my former roommates are all 10 plus years older than me, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=334s">00:05:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all of my peers left. And I remember at that time wrestling with the idea that I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=340s">00:05:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to go too, because there's nobody my age here. And I was wrestling with that, and said, "If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=346s">00:05:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I move because they moved, if I do things because they did it, then I will always be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=352s">00:05:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bound to whatever my peers are doing." And I had to ask that question again. Is Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=358s">00:05:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">better than your friends? Is he better than your peers? Different stages in life, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=365s">00:06:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different questions that we have to answer. You get married, you fall in love, and a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=371s">00:06:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of people get distracted during that period, and then they were doing fine while they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=375s">00:06:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">single, but once they get married, they begin to drift away. And that's another question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=379s">00:06:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to ask. Is Jesus better than your wife? After having children, I never was tempted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=389s">00:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">again, about like, I don't have elaborate taste, I mean, there's not a single name brand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=394s">00:06:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on my body, and I don't have any desire for that kind of stuff. But when I had kids, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=401s">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was first time I felt tempted, like I wanted some money. And it wasn't to buy a big house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=406s">00:06:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it was just I wanted a car with air conditioning, because I was driving a pickup truck and had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=411s">00:06:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">no air conditioning, and my first kid, we're in the car and he was sweating bullets driving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=416s">00:06:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to LA, and it was the first time I thought to myself, "I wish I had more money, so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=421s">00:07:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can get a better car, so that my baby could be in an air-conditioned car." And I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=428s">00:07:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wrestling with that, with those thoughts and temptation, asking myself, "Is Jesus better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=433s">00:07:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">than your kids?" Whatever stage of life that you're in, that's a question that you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=440s">00:07:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have to answer repeatedly.

Is Jesus better? So he's been talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=560s">00:09:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how he's better than the prophets, so therefore we need to pay close attention. He's better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=563s">00:09:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">than the angels, and he starts from the very top. The third argument that he will give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=569s">00:09:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is Jesus is better than angels because he's the creator. And the angels are just servants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=575s">00:09:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it wouldn't make any sense to be tempted to worship angels or to honor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=583s">00:09:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">them while you're drifting away from Christ. In verse 7, "And of the angels," he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=590s">00:09:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"who makes his angels' winds and his ministers a flame of fire?" In other words, that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=597s">00:09:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a rhetorical question. Of course God. God is the one who does this. But it can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=603s">00:10:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">be asked as an actual question. Who? Who makes them? The word for "make," if you guys remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=610s">00:10:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">last week, there's two separate words for "make." One is "poieo." Another one is "genomai."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=615s">00:10:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The word "poieo" basically means to make something out of nothing. It's to create something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=620s">00:10:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The word "genomai" is to have some form and be transformed to another form. So when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=626s">00:10:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I become Christians, we weren't made into a Christian. We became Christians. We were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=632s">00:10:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not Christians, and we became Christians. That's the word that is used to describe Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=637s">00:10:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">who humbled himself but became exalted. He wasn't created, but he was exalted. The word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=644s">00:10:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that is used here of the angels is "poieo," to create. So the natural question is, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=652s">00:10:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they were made, they were created, who created them? And the answer is obvious. In Colossians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=660s">00:11:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">1:16 it says, "For by him," speaking of Jesus, "all things were created both in heaven and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=666s">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=670s">00:11:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things have been made, have been created through him and for him." Not only did he create them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=678s">00:11:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he created them for himself. Hebrews chapter 1 10, "And you Lord, in the beginning, laid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=685s">00:11:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands." Now, the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=691s">00:11:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">why he starts with the angels is because even the angels, even the angels were created by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=697s">00:11:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">him and for him. They are ministers for Jesus. They are servants and messengers for Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=707s">00:11:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And whenever we thwart that authority, it is a rebellion against the Creator. Let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=714s">00:11:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">give you an example, okay, to help us understand lordship of Christ and what he is trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=720s">00:12:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">say here. Those of you guys who are with us at the other building, not this building but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=725s">00:12:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the other building, it was maybe about seven years ago, we were all excited and we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=730s">00:12:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">building a new building. First time our church, we were nomads wandering and then we finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=736s">00:12:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">had a place that's going to have our own. And we were all excited and it took us maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=740s">00:12:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about eight to nine months for the construction. And at the end of the construction, after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=745s">00:12:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all the structural things were done, they were making the stage, but the stage wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=750s">00:12:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily drawn out. So one day I showed up to the building while the contractors were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=755s">00:12:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">working and he said, "Hey, Pastor Peter, you need to get involved." And I said, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=761s">00:12:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do I need to get involved in?" He said, "The architect has very specific things that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=765s">00:12:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">wants on the stage and we're wondering if you agree with that." And I looked at it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=770s">00:12:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, "No, I mean, this is very strange." So he didn't have the actual, like the drawing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=775s">00:12:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, he has just a structural part of it. And then I looked at what he wanted to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=779s">00:12:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and he was making a stage into this weird oval shape where it was protruding on one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=785s">00:13:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">side and then going deep on the other side. It's kind of like the Korean flag. You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=790s">00:13:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what I mean? And I don't know why, he wasn't even Korean, but he was making this half wave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=796s">00:13:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And even the contractors were thinking like, "This is kind of strange." And he said they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=800s">00:13:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">were going back and forth and the architect obviously has authority over the contractor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=804s">00:13:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and he says, "No, this is what I want." And so I show up and he said, "Hey, you're the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=809s">00:13:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">contractor here, can you talk to the contractor?" So I found out what was going on and I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=813s">00:13:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to the contractor and I said, "You know, this is kind of weird." And I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=819s">00:13:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Where would I be preaching on this?" And he said, "You should be preaching in the corner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=822s">00:13:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">over there on the side." And those of you who know me, I'm very particular about being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=829s">00:13:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">symmetrical. Okay? That's something that's weird, but if something is not centered, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=837s">00:13:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bothers me. So some of you guys may notice that if I see the pulpit a little bit crooked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=841s">00:14:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll come and fix it before I come up here. Or even this mat, if it's not centered, I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=845s">00:14:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fix the mat before I start preaching because it bothers me. So whenever we set up the chairs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=850s">00:14:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I make sure that it's centered. Anyway, it's weird, but that bothers me. But he had me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=856s">00:14:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching on the side and he never asked me about it and I said, "I can't do that. I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=861s">00:14:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to preach in the middle." And then he was arguing with me and he said, "You're a young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=866s">00:14:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">church." Young church, that's how the old churches have it. He said, "Young church needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=871s">00:14:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to be hip and I know your church is young, so young church wants this." And I said, "No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=878s">00:14:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our church may be young, but we don't want that." And I was telling him, "I need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=884s">00:14:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the middle." And I was just going back and forth with him and I could tell he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=888s">00:14:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really being annoyed. And one thing that I learned through the years just working with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=892s">00:14:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">architects and kind of artsy people, right? Some of you guys are really artsy. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=898s">00:14:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">very particular about whatever work you did. You don't want anybody to change the color</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=904s">00:15:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or you don't want anybody to change the design. This is your thing. This is your creation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=909s">00:15:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't want anybody to touch it. I realize architects are engineers who really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=915s">00:15:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have a bent toward art. So they're very particular about their design. So I understood that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=922s">00:15:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like his imprint on this church. And he was well-meaning. He wanted to help us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=929s">00:15:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but he insisted that it had to be this way. And then obviously because he was coming out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=934s">00:15:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so strong, I said, "No, we're not going to have it this way. I'm not going to stand on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=938s">00:15:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the side on the top of the wave every week just being distracted. That's just not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=942s">00:15:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to happen." So he ended up changing the design, just kicking and screaming pretty much. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=949s">00:15:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then he got annoyed. The leaders know about this. And then everything was done.

Some of you guys remember what that building looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=961s">00:16:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like. But after about two, three months, somebody pointed out to me that the stage was not centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=968s">00:16:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you guys did not know that. And the stage was skewed maybe about two feet to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=973s">00:16:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">left. So every Sunday it bothered me. Every Sunday. Because I know I was centered, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=980s">00:16:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew the stage was not. So the whole room was symmetrical, but I was always standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=986s">00:16:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on the side and always like I knew it in the back of my mind. And I never got to ask him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=991s">00:16:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">why he did that. In my mind I think maybe he was angry. He was just being spiteful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=998s">00:16:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe it was just a mistake. But for whatever the reason, he insisted that it had to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1003s">00:16:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain way. Now the reason why I tell you this story is because we're the owners. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1009s">00:16:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hired you. And yes, you have an opinion, but we hired you to make certain things because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1014s">00:16:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be using it. We paid you to work for us. It doesn't make sense for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1020s">00:17:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to demand your preference on us.

If he made the angels to serve him, of course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1034s">00:17:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he made us to serve him. And it is no different than the creation basically telling the creator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1041s">00:17:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this is my opinion.

And the scripture says all have sinned and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1062s">00:17:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fall short of the glory of God because we were all in rebellion giving our opinion to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1067s">00:17:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the creator.

And he's saying Jesus is above even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1074s">00:17:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the angels. Of course he created us for the same purpose.

The word gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1091s">00:18:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in itself basically means good message.

Well in the chapter, verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1129s">00:18:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">8 is the key verse. Verse 8 it says, "But of the son he says, 'Your throne, O God, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1136s">00:18:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">forever and ever and the righteous scepter, the scepter of his kingdom.'" Who is speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1141s">00:19:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">here? Look at that verse. Who's speaking? When he says, "But of the son he says," who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1150s">00:19:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the he?

It was deliberately mistranslated so that it doesn't say the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1226s">00:20:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that our translation says.

I've been on campus talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1256s">00:20:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them, opening up the scriptures and saying, "You know what?" Because they claim that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1261s">00:21:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">translated their Bible out of the same Greek manuscript as the NIV.

And so if we're not careful, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1334s">00:22:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ends up happening is we pursue the community and we work hard to belong.

Scripture clearly says, "Christ is God." Jesus himself said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1351s">00:22:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this in John 10.30, "I and the Father are one." John 10.33, "The Jews answered him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1357s">00:22:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">'For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy.

It was clearly stated by Christ. It's clearly stated in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1369s">00:22:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews. It's clearly stated in the Gospels. And even the Jews heard clearly that Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1374s">00:22:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was not simply saying, "I am like God."

Is Jesus better? Is Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1399s">00:23:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">better than your career?

And obviously, the answer is, of course not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1418s">00:23:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus is God. Fourthly, he said, "Jesus is greater than the angels because Jesus was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1427s">00:23:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">anointed above the angels, because he loved righteousness and hated lawlessness." I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1433s">00:23:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he's talking about Jesus' humanity.

Before we move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1445s">00:24:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on about this, it's like, "Yeah, I see he loved righteousness." But I want to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1450s">00:24:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">few minutes to talk about what this means. Because righteousness sounds very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1456s">00:24:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to different people and different culture and different times. What seemed righteous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1460s">00:24:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the previous generation seems unrighteous in this generation.

And one of the older deacons of the church, and he must have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1518s">00:25:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">probably maybe in his 70s, he walked in right in the middle of the service and he grabbed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1525s">00:25:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the music stand that the youth pastor was preaching off of and he started walking out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1531s">00:25:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the room. And so obviously I said, "What is he doing?" And so I grabbed the pulpit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1538s">00:25:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I put it back and I told him, "Hey, just keep going, I'll deal with this." And I took him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1542s">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">outside and I started scolding him. And I said, "Deacon so-and-so, you can't do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1550s">00:25:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a worship just because they're kids. It's not less of a worship. And if you come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1556s">00:25:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in here and you take a pulpit, on a pulpit that the pastor is preaching out of, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1561s">00:26:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">message do you think that gives the kids? That they're not valuable, their worship isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1567s">00:26:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">as good as the older people just because they're young." And I was just scolding him, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1573s">00:26:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">upset and I said, "You shouldn't be doing this and no wonder why Korean American kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1578s">00:26:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">are leaving church because you don't respect them and you're ruining the worship." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1584s">00:26:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this whole thing is like, "Because I'm righteous. I'm speaking on God's behalf. He needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1589s">00:26:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">be rebuked." And as I was scolding him, and he didn't fight back, he knew what he did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1595s">00:26:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was wrong. And as I was scolding him, I was trying to calm myself down. And then the adult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1599s">00:26:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">service just finished.

And so they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1613s">00:26:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">go, "What is going on?" So they pulled me aside, "Pastor Peter, what happened?" And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1616s">00:26:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I explained to them the situation. And the response that they gave me was, "Yeah, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1622s">00:27:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">know, he shouldn't have done that. That's not right. But what you did was worse." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1628s">00:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I go, "What are you talking about? I'm speaking for God. This is worship. I'm protecting our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1634s">00:27:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kids." But I realized that in the Korean culture, that's a greater sin to dishonor the older</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1643s">00:27:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people. And so whatever mistake that he made, they acknowledged that, but he said, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1648s">00:27:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you did was far worse because you embarrassed him in front of the church." It took me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1653s">00:27:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">long time to digest that. It took me a long time to digest that. Like, why would... Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1659s">00:27:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my mindset is Western. And so in the Western culture, we have a tendency to rely on contracts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1666s">00:27:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And what is right and what is wrong. And when somebody breaks that, that's unrighteous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1671s">00:27:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we need to deal with that. And that's why we go on the streets, we protest, we shame</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1675s">00:27:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people who break laws and we do all of this stuff. But in the Eastern culture, it is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1680s">00:28:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">greater sin. And universally, they will look at that as a greater sin. That's why in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1687s">00:28:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Asian culture, they don't consider you mature when you become independent. They consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1693s">00:28:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you mature when you become mature enough to acknowledge your elders. You know what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1699s">00:28:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about? If you don't, it's because you're Western. And I realized that in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1707s">00:28:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">two separate cultures, what offends one culture is honored in another culture, and what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1714s">00:28:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">honored in one culture is offended in another culture. So we have to be very careful that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1720s">00:28:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't project what you and I think of righteousness, and that we are careful that what we consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1727s">00:28:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be righteous is based upon scripture. Jesus himself rebukes the Pharisees. Matthew 23,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1732s">00:28:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">23 says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

It's not one or the other. He says you need to obey the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1756s">00:29:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">law without neglecting the what?

And what was the weightier matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1764s">00:29:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">See, compassion, faithfulness, mercy, justice, these are not tangible things.

And he says, you think you're righteous because you are tithing these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1779s">00:29:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">even the smallest of these things, but when it comes to weightier things, you are blind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1786s">00:29:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When we think of righteousness, majority of Christians automatically feel burdened.

What did Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1803s">00:30:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">do and what he did not do?

Or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1814s">00:30:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here's some things that I really like to do, but I can't do that.

In 1 Timothy 6, 5-6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1825s">00:30:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "In constant friction between men and depraved mind and deprived of truth, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1831s">00:30:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">suppose that godliness is a means of gain.

In other words, he said he's rebuking that generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1845s">00:30:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and saying, "You know, some of these people are practicing righteousness because if they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1849s">00:30:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">practice, if they do the right thing and avoid the wrong thing, that God's going to reward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1853s">00:30:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them."

His glory was lost at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1872s">00:31:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">fall. He's trying to restore us to be righteous.

His commandments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1905s">00:31:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are not burdensome. Is this true?

Again, if we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1914s">00:31:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of righteousness as simply as something we do and certain things that we don't do, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1918s">00:31:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">course it's burdensome. Because you naturally want to do certain things and God's law prevents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1924s">00:32:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you.

But what does he mean? If you love God, you obey his commands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1936s">00:32:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and his commands are not burdensome. Let me give you another example. Are people easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1944s">00:32:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to love or hard to love? Don't answer that. I don't want you getting in trouble with your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1949s">00:32:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">neighbors. Okay? Are people easy to love or hard to love? It's hard to answer that question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1958s">00:32:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's too broad. I have to ask the question in more detail. Maybe if I gave you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1964s">00:32:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a specific name. Is this person hard to love or easy to love? You say, "He's easy to love."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1973s">00:32:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is he easy to love? Because he's always looking out for me, he's always encouraging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1978s">00:32:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">me, he's always doing things for me. You can list all these things. When I think of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1983s">00:33:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">person, it's easy to love. And then there's, "What about her?" I say, "Well, she's hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1988s">00:33:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to love because whenever I'm around her, she makes me feel guilty and she's always ripping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=1995s">00:33:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">on me and saying all of these things and so I have to love her." So it's burdensome to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=2001s">00:33:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">love her. When he says to love God means to obey his commandments, it is not burdensome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=2011s">00:33:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">not because the commandment in itself is not burdensome, but because of who is giving the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=2017s">00:33:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">command. I can honestly tell you, for me, in my life, the person that's easiest to love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=2024s">00:33:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is my wife. It doesn't require a lot of work, to be honest. And the reason why is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/319352203#t=2031s">00:33:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody has my back like my wife.
