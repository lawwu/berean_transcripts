However, Kiwi prayed, and our god delivered them from the bullies by giving them boils. Ew. Now, they will participate in our first event of day two, the pencil job. Let's give a round of applause as the contestants come on stage.  As a special guest, Cassidy the chum will be the pencil holder of this event. Now, let's welcome the koalas.  The koalas and the Marines.  Now, let's give it up for the Scrantonians.  And the Pawnee.  All right. Now, each team will go one at a time to touch that pencil. Ready? Koalas, on your mark, get set, go.  And the Marines, let's go.  And the Marines.  It's too easy. All right. And the last one. All right. Now, the next round, Taz and Peter Chung will go on the magical chair that will make him so much taller. How will they be able to reach the pencil this time? Now, the koalas will go next. The final round. Koalas. Koalas must try their best. Send one representative. And they got it.  Woo! What a round. That's Marines. We'll go for it.  Yeah. Oh, no. And the Pawnee. Oh, no. All right. Now, the Pawnee will go.  Aw. And the last one. Oh, no. And with that, the Pawnee have been disqualified. The koalas have won.  Yeah. Yeah.  Looks like we won again. We're the winners. It's because we're so strong. Look at us. We're so strong. We're the best. We are the best. We're not like that loser over there. Look at that loser. Check it out. Excuse me. Can you hold this microphone, please? Loser. Loser? Loser. Hey. Hey, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm chill, you know. No, I'm not. Oh, my gosh. Everything hurts. And I'm always in pain. Sansan, can you remind me every 30 seconds that everything will be OK? Everything will be OK. OK. Well, I know you guys are out, but our god wins over everything. Yeah, yesterday in class, we learned that god comes in first. We can't idolize him or other idols before. Everything will be OK. But whenever I'm feeling bad, I listen to my favorite idol, Lil Sebastian. Oh, my gosh. She's so dreamy. And whenever I listen to him, I feel so much better. Everything will be OK. I think it's OK to listen to Lil Sebastian sometimes, but it's not good to idolize him. We need to put god first. Yeah. Well, whenever I listen to Lil Sebastian, I feel so much better. Should I praise god first, or should I put idols in front of him? I mean, the veil of pain didn't really do much. Maybe god had me lose for a reason. Yeah. Do you want me to pray for you? I want to-- Dear god, please watch over our friend, Milk, and give her hope in these tough times. Assure her that you are always first. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen. Wow. Thanks to you, you beautiful tropical fish. Thanks for always being there for me. You know what? You're right. I haven't been putting god first as my first priority. Can you teach me more about god's word? Yeah, me too. Everything will be OK when you put god first. As Milk had hope in god's word, the Bereans shared god's words in Acts chapter 17 11 times. They read the Bible and decided to go sign up for the Berean all church retreat on August 3 to the 5th at Palm Springs. The weather is projected at 107 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, so make sure to wear sunscreen every hour. Meanwhile, the evil Koalas plotted their plan against the Bereans to win the Olympics.   I'm so evil. We're so evil. Yeah, we're so strong. We're so strong. No, I'm strong. Hey, I said we're so strong. OK, maybe we're strong. Those Bereans would never know it if tomorrow we're going to do something so evil.    Strong, faster, love, and live, stand, and fall, and fight, and raise up, strong, faster. The sting of the whip on my shoulder, with the salt of my sweat on my brow. And oh, King of mine, can you hear your people cry? At last now, this is our power. Deliver us, deliver all, deliver us, for the Lord remember us in His burning hand. Deliver us, better than you promised us. Deliver us to the promised land.  And so, although Swansong and Noah from Pond are now out of the race, they found that God has bigger and better plans for them. Noah learned to worship God and not idolize little Sebastian while they prepared for the all-church retreat next month. Find out what happens next tomorrow at the first Korean Summer Olympics 2018.</p></div></body></html>
