We have three boys, age 10, 7, and 1. You guys might know them as Jordan, Jacoby, and Jude. We moved to California from New York about six years ago and have been coming to Berean since November of 2019, a couple months before the pandemic. To share a little bit about my testimony, I was infant baptized and grew up going to church with my family. Though outwardly I was attending church and serving a youth group every Sunday, inwardly I was living a very self-centered and people-centered life. My heart was embittered towards my parents, and I lived primarily for the approval of man. I knew about God in my head and learned about the do's and don'ts of Christianity, but it didn't have a lasting impact in my daily life, thoughts, or actions. When I was a sophomore in college, I attended a college conference, and it was during that prayer time when I finally understood the power of the gospel. For the first time, I came face to face with my own depravity and sins, and God slowly began to reveal the heart and heart, as well as all the sins of self-righteousness, bitterness, pride, and all of the false idols that I had been living for. That time of confession was not only humbling, but emotionally overwhelming, as I recognized the power of the cross and Jesus' sacrifice for me. Experiencing His love and forgiveness was what freed me from bitterness and enabled me to love and forgive others. Rather than trying to live for the approval and purposes of man, I was now excited to live for His kingdom purpose. That was the year when I laid down my life and turned to Christ as my personal Savior and Lord. Over the past eight years, it's been quite a faith journey and adventure for our family. There's been so many transitions from career to church, to moving from New Jersey to Boston to Florida, and now to California. But in the midst of continual transitions and trials, I'm holding on to the promises of God, and I look forward to starting and sharing life together with this Berean family. I'll close with this verse from Romans 6, verse 4. It says, "We were buried, therefore, with Him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life." Thank you.    >> Do you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ and his death and you are being united with his resurrected life when you come out? >> I do. >> I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p></div></body></html>
