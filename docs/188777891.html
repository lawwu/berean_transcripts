Let's pray. Gracious Father, we pray that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=116s">00:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">your Word would be your words, Lord God, and not mine, not man's, not our opinions, but the authority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=127s">00:02:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have placed. I pray, Father God, that your Word would go forth. Cause us to see clearly who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=133s">00:02:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you are, what it is that we have in Christ. That our understanding of the gift of the Spirit, our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=139s">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation, Christ crucified, all of these things, Lord God, that may be correctly understood. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=145s">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">our minds, our thoughts, and our worship may be thoroughly influenced, Lord God, by who you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We ask for your anointing over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. As we've been talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=157s">00:02:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">justification by faith, and again, chapter 6, where he says, "Well, if it's justification by faith, isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=164s">00:02:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that going to lead to licentiousness?" There is no consequence for sin. If that's the case, then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=170s">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">can just do whatever we want. And of course, that's not what God desires, but if that is what happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=175s">00:02:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so what? I mean, genuine Christians aren't gonna say, "So what?" But in reality, that may actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=182s">00:03:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">happen, right? There's no consequence. So Paul says, "That is not the case at all, by no means."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=187s">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't happen because when we were crucified with Christ, our old self died, and we were renewed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=194s">00:03:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ, we were united with Him. We were married, we were freed from the marriage of the previous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=201s">00:03:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with the law, and now we are married to Christ. We're no longer enslaved to the law of sin, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=207s">00:03:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">now we're enslaved to righteousness. So therefore, he says, that is not what happens to a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=214s">00:03:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does not. A genuine justification by faith actually leads to genuine sanctification, genuine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=220s">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">growth in his spiritual life. He says, "Then what is the purpose of the law?" Chapter 7. "It came in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=225s">00:03:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">order to reveal sin, it came in order to stir up sin, and it came so that sin would become utterly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=230s">00:03:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sinful." To lead us to a point where Paul says in verse 24, chapter 7, "Woe is me! Oh, what a wretched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=238s">00:03:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">man that I am! Who is going to deliver me from this body of sin?" And so he introduces Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and through Christ and His blood sacrifice, how we become renewed. So what we could not do, what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=250s">00:04:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">law could not do, we can by the sinful flesh. God did by sending His only begotten Son. And so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=255s">00:04:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. So we said that God initiates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=261s">00:04:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation, Jesus Christ mediates salvation, and the Holy Spirit is the one who perpetuates, gives us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=267s">00:04:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the power so that now not only are we saved, we are being saved by the Holy Spirit, and that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=273s">00:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">will be saved ultimately. And that is in a nutshell how the Bible describes our salvation. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=281s">00:04:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. A non-Christian can declare to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=286s">00:04:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">know God. A non-Christian can even say that Jesus Christ came and He died. Remember even the demons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=294s">00:04:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">when they saw Jesus they bowed to the ground and said, "Son of God, have you come before your time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=299s">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to torture us?" Satan knew exactly what Jesus was doing so he enters into Judas and tries to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=306s">00:05:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">prevent him from going. And then he influences Peter trying to get him not to go. So Satan was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=311s">00:05:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">very aware of what Jesus was going to do. So the demons were not unaware. So James says, "If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=317s">00:05:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have faith without deeds, it's dead faith. It is no different than these demons who declare these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=322s">00:05:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things. They believe in a God but it doesn't produce works." So the distinction between a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=327s">00:05:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit that regenerates, Holy Spirit that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=333s">00:05:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">indwells, and Holy Spirit that empowers us. That is not disputed. There is a dispute between, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=344s">00:05:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 7, is that a Christian or a non-Christian? Now again depending on which era of commentary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=349s">00:05:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that you read you're gonna get different views. That could be up to interpretation. But what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=354s">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just said about the power of the Holy Spirit, about a Christian having indwelling of the Holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=359s">00:05:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit, that is not disputed no matter what denomination, no matter what era of Christianity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=363s">00:06:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you may read. But there's a tension. There are things that sometimes we say in the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=370s">00:06:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then there's a disconnect in the way that we live. And so after a while when you continue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=378s">00:06:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">live your life and you see this disconnect, there's a disconnect from the Bible and your life. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=384s">00:06:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">disconnect is pretty obvious. And I think that the greatest of this disconnect is, I know what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=389s">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible says, but I don't see this in my life. Nor do I see it in the life of majority of the Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=394s">00:06:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I know some people, but majority of the Christians that I know, I don't see this. So because of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=401s">00:06:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">tension between here's what God says we ought to do, says who we are, and then what I'm experiencing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=407s">00:06:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm seeing, I would see it on television, people giving their lives. Every once in a while we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=413s">00:06:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">missionaries who are packing up their bags and doing crazy things for Christ. It's like, okay, I see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=418s">00:06:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in them. But in our personal lives, that may not be the case. So different groups have come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=425s">00:07:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the solution to this. So the Pentecostals have said, maybe the reason why there's this disconnect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=431s">00:07:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's this gap between who we ought to be and who we are, is that we need a second baptism of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=437s">00:07:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit. That you were baptized maybe when you became a Christian, or maybe you weren't baptized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=443s">00:07:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at all. And you really need to be baptized by the Holy Spirit. So there's two levels of Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=448s">00:07:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's Christians who are not filled with the Holy Spirit, and then there's Christians who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=452s">00:07:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">filled with the Holy Spirit. Now, years ago we were out in Balboa, and we were out witnessing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=459s">00:07:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sharing the Gospel with people. And I ran into a group of people who believed that, Apostolic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=462s">00:07:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Pentecostals. And they believed that the evidence that you have this baptism with the Holy Spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=469s">00:07:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that you need to speak in tongues. So we were going back and forth, opening up the Scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=473s">00:07:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and they had this whole chart in the back of their trunk, and they were showing me all of this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=477s">00:07:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, at the end, we said, "You know what? Let's just pray. Let's pray, because we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=482s">00:08:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not getting anywhere." So I started praying with them, and it was surprising. As soon as I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=486s">00:08:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">praying, all of them, about 12, 13 of them who was out there, surrounded me. And all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=492s">00:08:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right in the middle of the Balboa, you know where the, what do you call it? The bridge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=497s">00:08:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Pier. Pier, yeah, the pier. Right in the beginning of that pier, they surrounded me, and all 12 of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=503s">00:08:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just started speaking in tongues. You know? And so I was praying, and I remember after the prayer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=510s">00:08:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just looking up at them, and they said, "Did you get it? Did you get the tongues?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=513s">00:08:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "No." You know? But with them, the distinguishing mark between a Christian and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=518s">00:08:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">non-Christian is, do you speak tongues? Because if you don't speak tongues, that means you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=522s">00:08:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the Holy Spirit. We have variations of that, even though, again, completely unbiblical. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=528s">00:08:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">gonna get into arguing all of this. Maybe one of these days, when we have a systematic theology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=533s">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">class, that we can get into more details of why that's not biblical. But we have variations of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=538s">00:08:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Some people will say, "Well, maybe people are immature, because there is a lack of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=544s">00:09:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">organization, lack of discipleship. You haven't met the right person, and you're not doing certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=549s">00:09:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things right." And so, maybe that's what it is. Maybe if we applied the right methodology. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=555s">00:09:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">if we were organized differently, and then we were more relevant. But the problem with that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=561s">00:09:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is, if you go to church, to church, to church, to church, using different methodology, and different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=567s">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">organization, you'll see that this struggle is consistent over denominations, over different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=576s">00:09:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">groups, over campus ministries, over ages. Recently, we had a resurgence of Reformed Theology. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=585s">00:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">again, getting us back to the Scripture, obviously, is a great thing. But it also led to this pseudo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=592s">00:09:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">intellectualism. Thinking that if you have enough knowledge, and if you can quote enough things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=597s">00:09:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and read enough books, that somehow that makes you mature. And so, that's how we're bridging the gap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=602s">00:10:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">between a matured and non-mature person. This idea has taken even outside of the Christian circle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=610s">00:10:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where people are so frustrated with this. Some of these cults say, "Maybe it's because you're at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=614s">00:10:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong church, that you need to be baptized into the Church of Christ." So, that's the reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=619s">00:10:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not experiencing this abundant life, because you're at the wrong church. And so, you have to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=624s">00:10:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to their church, and you have to be baptized. In fact, I spent almost a whole year with one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=629s">00:10:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">leaders, or two of the guys, who are on campus at UCI. And the two guys who are there, the local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=637s">00:10:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">church movement. You guys may or may not know, because they tend to change their name every once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=642s">00:10:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in a while. But basically, they were saying that, you know, there's two different groups of Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=646s">00:10:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a regular Christian, and then Kingdom Christian. Kingdom Christian are people who belong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=651s">00:10:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to their church. So, those are the people who are saved in body, soul, and spirit. So, the regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=659s">00:10:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians are Christians who are only saved body and soul, but not spirit. So, we spent a long time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=664s">00:11:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">arguing and discussing over this. And so, but the tension of what caused them to get there is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=670s">00:11:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">same. Because they see what they see in the church, and what they see in the Scripture, it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=676s">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">match. So, where is the sanctification, and how do we bridge this gap? We need to make sure, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=684s">00:11:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">first and foremost, as we studied on Thursday, that whatever it is that we think to be true or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=690s">00:11:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">false, doesn't come from my worldview, or what I think is right, or what makes the most sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=697s">00:11:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to make sure that it is coming from a careful study of the Word of God. Where does my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=704s">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thought come from? Where does my convictions come from? Obviously, it's clear we need to come to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=709s">00:11:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Word of God. The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian, clearly, is the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=715s">00:11:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What the law could not do, God did by sending His Son, who walked in the Spirit, not according to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=723s">00:12:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the flesh. So, the two extreme ways to apply this, if the Holy Spirit is the answer, how do we apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=731s">00:12:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this? So, you have one extreme where it says, "Just let go and let God." Since it's not me and the Holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=736s">00:12:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit, it kind of makes us a passive recipient, and we just kind of sit there, and then, "Well, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=741s">00:12:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit's not doing anything, so what can I do?" That's not what the Bible teaches. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=746s">00:12:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's imperative in the Scripture, "Be filled with the Spirit." Walk in the Spirit, right? To,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=751s">00:12:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all things to be done in the Spirit. So, these are imperatives, or things that we are taught to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=757s">00:12:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Do not grieve the Spirit. The other extreme is to think that, "Well, if it's the Holy Spirit, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=763s">00:12:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow I can wield the Holy Spirit. That if I maybe just did certain things, quoted the certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=769s">00:12:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">verses, or prayed a certain way, that I can capture the power of the Holy Spirit and wield it toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=774s">00:12:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain direction." Now, we see that mistake in Acts chapter 8, 17 to 20. If you remember a man</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=781s">00:13:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">named Simon, when he sees Peter praying for people, and the Holy Spirit comes upon them, remember what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=786s">00:13:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">he does? He says, "Well, I have money. How much is it going to cost? How much can I give you, and can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=791s">00:13:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you give me this power?" And as a result of that, Peter gets angry, and he says, "Not only will you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=796s">00:13:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not receive this power, you're going to be judged for thinking that you're able to purchase this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=800s">00:13:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then another example we see in Acts chapter 19, the sons of Sceva, where Paul is going around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=808s">00:13:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and he's doing tremendous amount of miracles. And so, he thinks that maybe he could also cast out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=813s">00:13:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">demons. And then, so the sons of Sceva, these seven sons of Sceva, get in a room with this demon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=820s">00:13:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">possessed man, and tries to cast out the demon. Remember what the demon says? "I know Paul, and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=826s">00:13:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">know Jesus, but who are you?" And then what happens, he says, "They overcome this man, and they strip him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=835s">00:13:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">naked, and they run out screaming, wounded." So, what is the point of that? You can't wield the Holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=842s">00:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit. It was in their arrogance to think, "Maybe if we did this, oh, they can do it. Maybe I can do it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=848s">00:14:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result of that, they get overcome, and they get thoroughly humiliated. The Holy Spirit is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=853s">00:14:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not something for us to wield. No different than God Himself, for us to think that somehow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=859s">00:14:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if we say the right magic words, God has to bend to our prayers. Which, again, a whole group of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=867s">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a whole movement called the Word-Faith Movement that actually taught that. Then, if that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=872s">00:14:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not the case, if we can't wield His power, if we're not to be passive, and just passive recipients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=877s">00:14:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we engage this Holy Spirit? What does this power of the Holy Spirit look like in the life of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=882s">00:14:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a Christian? Some of you, I know, were probably wrestling with that and thinking, "Ok, now He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=887s">00:14:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to give us the answer, and we're going to fix this problem once and for all." Right? If that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=891s">00:14:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the case, that would have happened a long time ago. Right? But I want to show you what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=895s">00:14:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture says. But first and foremost, we have to understand when we think of power, that that power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=905s">00:15:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're expecting and hoping for is the power described in the Bible. Not what you and I oftentimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=914s">00:15:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">equate with power. Because, again, in 2 Corinthians 12, 9, Jesus deliberately humbles Paul. And Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=921s">00:15:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">says at the end of his struggle that, "When I am weak, He is powerful. He is strong." So He deliberately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=927s">00:15:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">makes us weak in order to demonstrate His power. But I want to give you, I think, the most tangible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=933s">00:15:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tangible evidence, or tangible demonstration of what God deems to be powerful. Turn your Bibles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=941s">00:15:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with me to 1 Kings chapter 19, 9-18. Elijah is a prophet during a period of probably one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=950s">00:15:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">worst kings of Israel, Ahab. And his wife was even worse, Jezebel. There's an encounter that Elijah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=958s">00:15:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has with the idol worshippers, these priests. And over 400 of them encounter him. And they say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=966s">00:16:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's your God or my God, let's see what happens." And God comes and consumes them with fire and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=972s">00:16:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">die. So you would think at the end a revival would break out. Nothing of the sort. After that event,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=982s">00:16:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">when Jezebel hears from Ahab, Ahab comes running to his wife and tells his wife exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=988s">00:16:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. Elijah, this troublemaker, he killed all our prophets. And then Jezebel's determined,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=993s">00:16:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm gonna get this guy. We're gonna make sure he dies." She's just determined. She's not afraid of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=999s">00:16:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">him at all. And then it's strange that Elijah, after seeing that kind of power from God, gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1006s">00:16:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so discouraged, he runs off and hides into a cave. That's the setup. He's in a cave right now. He ran</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1013s">00:16:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">away because Jezebel said, "I'm gonna kill him." Right? Verse 9, "There he came to a cave and lodged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1019s">00:16:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in it. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him. And he said to him, 'What are you doing here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1024s">00:17:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Elijah?'" Right? "And he said, 'I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1030s">00:17:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1035s">00:17:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with the sword. And I, even I, only am left, and they seek my life to take it away.'" You see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1041s">00:17:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">discouragement of Elijah was he expected a revival to break out. But instead of revival, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1048s">00:17:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">determined to get him. And Jezebel and Ahab said, "We're gonna kill this guy." So he said, "I've done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1052s">00:17:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">everything I could possibly do, but it's just not working. Not only is it not working, I'm the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1058s">00:17:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">prophet left. And I'm done. I don't know if I can keep doing this." So he's burnt out. He just saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1065s">00:17:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the greatest power of God, and now he's hiding in a cave. Just a few days later, he's hiding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1071s">00:17:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in a cave. He said, "I'm burnt out. I'm tired. Lord, I don't want to do this anymore." And then he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1076s">00:17:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord, and I will pass by." And behold, the Lord passes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1083s">00:18:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">by. So he said, "I'm gonna show you. You're burnt out, and you need to have a fresh encounter with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1090s">00:18:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">me." And so God says, "Go out and wait for me, and God's gonna pass by." And he says, "And a great and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1098s">00:18:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">strong wind tore the mountains and broke into pieces the rocks before the Lord." Some of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1103s">00:18:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">translations actually says that it's a hurricane that came in, right? The language is it wasn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1109s">00:18:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a normal strong wind. It was a hurricane that came. Now, I want you to think to yourself, "Why does God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1115s">00:18:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do this?" Right? Why does God go through all this drama? Who created this wind? Did it just happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1121s">00:18:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that when He stood out there, just randomly some wind went by? Who did it? God must have done it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1127s">00:18:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a hurricane and an earthquake and fire all happened just randomly at the same time and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1133s">00:18:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, that wasn't me." Clearly it was God, right? But he said his clear presence wasn't there. Earthquake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1141s">00:19:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">comes next, and you would think like, "Earthquake?" Right? We live in Southern California, so when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1147s">00:19:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hear the word "earthquake," it's like, "Oh, okay. It's just another day." You know? But if you ever have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1151s">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">friends or cousins that come from the East Coast or the Midwest, and the earth shakes for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1156s">00:19:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit, they freak out. Right? So the earth shakes. Who did that? It wasn't a train that was going by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1163s">00:19:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't a thunder. It was God Himself did it. But He said God wasn't there. Fire comes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1169s">00:19:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but nowhere. Fire comes, and God's not there either. Right? Why does He go through all of this drama to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1179s">00:19:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrate to Elijah that He's not there? So what happens next? God shows up, and He says, "What does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1184s">00:19:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He say?" At the end of verse 12, "And after the fire, the sound of a low whisper." And that's where He was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1193s">00:19:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Not the hurricane, not the earthquake, and not the consuming fire, and all of these things in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1203s">00:20:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">past. God showed Himself in those things. But to Elijah specifically, He said He wasn't there. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1210s">00:20:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">He deliberately shows up as a whisperer. Why does He do that? Because Elijah just experienced this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1217s">00:20:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">fire. He experienced the thunder. He experienced this tremendous power of God, and nothing happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1226s">00:20:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Even after all of that, these people aren't going to repent? "I quit!" That's where He was. That's why He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1237s">00:20:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was in the cave. "I quit!" And so God is trying to show Elijah that you're looking for maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1246s">00:20:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the fire wasn't big enough. Maybe if the thunder was louder. Maybe the earthquake was even bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1252s">00:20:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And He's looking for this mighty power. And He says, "No." He comes in a gentle whisper, and then He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1259s">00:20:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak, just like any other man in the presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1265s">00:21:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of His glory, recognizes his sin, and he wraps himself, and he hides. And behold, there came a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1273s">00:21:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">voice to him and said, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'" The second time asks him, right? "What are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1279s">00:21:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">doing here?" And he gives the same response, verse 14, "I've been very jealous for the Lord, the God of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1283s">00:21:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hosts, for the people of Israel. I've forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1288s">00:21:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life to take it away." After</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1294s">00:21:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that, nothing has changed. And they're still trying to kill me. And the response of God, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1305s">00:21:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">almost comical, because there's no hoopla. There's no shaking. There's no miracle. He just says, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1315s">00:21:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord said to him, "Go back. Go return on your way to the wilderness in Damascus, and let me tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1321s">00:22:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you what you're going to do. Go back. There's going to be some remnants. There's Elohim, and my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1326s">00:22:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people are here." He doesn't say, "The ground's going to shake, and thunder's going to happen." He just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1333s">00:22:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Go back. Just keep doing what I'm telling you to do." Right? What was his point? God is powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1344s">00:22:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the thunder, in the earthquake, in the fire, and in the whisper. See, our tendency is, when we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1354s">00:22:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about the Holy Spirit and power, we're thinking about something to happen, revival. Like something to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1360s">00:22:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">happen, something to shake me, like get me out. You know, I'm stuck. Get me out. I need a super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1365s">00:22:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">truck. I need a plane. I need something. But it's the description that Paul gives of somebody who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1373s">00:22:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">is saved and delivered from sin. It's just his mind. He says, "For those who live according to the flesh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1382s">00:23:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">set their minds on the things of the flesh. But those who live according to the Spirit set their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1386s">00:23:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">minds on the things of the Spirit." And he just describes, it's just your mind. Your mind is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1391s">00:23:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">different between somebody who's in the Spirit and somebody who's living in the flesh. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1398s">00:23:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the questions I ask is, "Is this describing what you ought to do or who you are?" It's clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1403s">00:23:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">an indicative. This is not an imperative. He's describing a Christian and a non-Christian. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1408s">00:23:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian was, what's going on in your head?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1412s">00:23:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? It doesn't sound too dramatic. I mean, really? That's it? I know some of you guys were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1420s">00:23:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">waiting all week to think, like, "What is he gonna say? What's the answer?" Like, "Give me the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1425s">00:23:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so that I can have sanctification." Well, I mean, it just seems so mundane. But I want to show you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1432s">00:23:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">oftentimes what we're looking for may be no different than what the Jews were looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1442s">00:24:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember what he says? "The Jews asked for signs and the Greeks looked for wisdom, but we preached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1450s">00:24:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ crucified." And I'm gonna keep reading. He says, "But we preached Christ crucified, a stumbling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1457s">00:24:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">block to Jews and a folly to the Gentiles, but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1461s">00:24:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1467s">00:24:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and the weakness of God is stronger than men." What you consider to be powerful, in God's eyes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1474s">00:24:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is weakness. 1 Corinthians 1:18, "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1482s">00:24:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God." So, when we think about this power,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1488s">00:24:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the Holy Spirit, our first thing is something happening, something rumbling, something's gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1493s">00:24:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">happen. But he says, "It's foolish. It's just so mundane. It's the preaching of the cross." In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1499s">00:24:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's two areas in the Bible where there's a concentration of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1506s">00:25:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">called pneumatology. Not pneumatology, pneumology, right? So, Chapter 8 is one of them, and then John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1514s">00:25:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 14, 15, 16 is the other.

And He explains why the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1526s">00:25:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit is going to come. Verse 16, Chapter 14, verse 16. He says, "And I will ask the Father,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1537s">00:25:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and He will give you another Helper to be with you forever." Okay, so one, just remember that. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1542s">00:25:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">calls Him Helper, and then verse 26, again, He says, "But the Helper of the Holy Spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1546s">00:25:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Helper of the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1551s">00:25:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one, He's called the Helper. The purpose of the Holy Spirit coming is to help us. Help us what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1556s">00:25:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">To continue on, to continue to follow Him. Right? What is He going to do? "And even the Spirit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1562s">00:26:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Truth," okay, He's called the Helper, He's called the Spirit of Truth, "whom the world cannot receive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1567s">00:26:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. You know Him, for He dwells with you, and will be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1574s">00:26:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you." And then, if you go further down in verse 26, He describes exactly why He is coming. Verse 26,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1583s">00:26:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "But the Helper of the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1587s">00:26:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you." All right, stop right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1593s">00:26:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you look at chapter 14, when Jesus says that the Holy Spirit is going to come, why is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1599s">00:26:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit coming? One, to help you. He says, "I'm going where I go, you cannot come." And then He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1608s">00:26:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Oh, what about us?" And they're freaking out. And then, so He says in verse 18, "I will not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1613s">00:26:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">leave you as orphans, and I will come to you." And then He's talking about the Holy Spirit. So, in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1619s">00:26:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit, the Helper comes, the Spirit of Truth, "He will bring to remembrance all that I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1623s">00:27:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">taught you." And then, if you go to chapter 16, verse 7, again He describes the ministry of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1632s">00:27:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit. "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1637s">00:27:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you. And when He comes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1642s">00:27:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He will convict the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment; concerning sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1647s">00:27:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because they do not believe in Me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1651s">00:27:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you will see Me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged." So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1656s">00:27:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let's put that all together. The Holy Spirit is coming, called the Helper, the Spirit of Truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1662s">00:27:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to cause us to remember all that Christ has said. He's going to convict the world of sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1668s">00:27:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and of righteousness. If we were to wrap that up in a short, concise statement, basically what He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1675s">00:27:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is He's causing us to remember Christ. That's what He said. And what does that mean? What does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1685s">00:28:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that have to do with when Paul says, "The Holy Spirit, the people who are Christians and non-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1691s">00:28:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian is what's going on in their mind." Right? People who are of the Spirit have their minds set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1696s">00:28:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the things of the Spirit. People of the flesh set their mind on the things of the flesh. Here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1701s">00:28:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what's interesting. The word for repentance is "metanoia." And the word "metanoia" literally in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1708s">00:28:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the Greek is two words put together, "meta" to change, "noia" is the mind. So, the literal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1714s">00:28:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding of this word repentance means to change your mind. So, when Paul says, "A Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1720s">00:28:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and a non-Christian," he's a Christian is somebody whose mind has been changed, who's repented, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1727s">00:28:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">he no longer looks at the world the same way. That his mind is continually set on the things of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1733s">00:28:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit. And the one who's not is the one who's continually set his mind on the flesh. Some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1738s">00:28:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys who have the NIV translation, the word "flesh" is translated "sinful nature." Okay. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1748s">00:29:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not the literal translation of that word. NIV translated "sinful nature" because they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1754s">00:29:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Well, it means flesh." That's what Paul must mean. So, they basically translated it for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1759s">00:29:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreted it for you. But the literal word for flesh is just "flesh." So, what Paul really is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1766s">00:29:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">saying is, "A Christian and a non-Christian is somebody who is constantly living, thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1772s">00:29:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and consumed with the things of this world." You may come to church on Sunday, but the rest of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1779s">00:29:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">week is your mind is no different than anybody else. But a Christian who's been renewed by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1785s">00:29:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit, and because of his faith, is constantly thinking of the things of the Spirit. Next year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1793s">00:29:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Esther and I are planning our 25th, you know, anniversary. 25th anniversary really is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1800s">00:30:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">first honeymoon, because our first honeymoon after we got married, we just drove to San Francisco. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1805s">00:30:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we're trying to... we didn't have money. We were young at that time, so we thought, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1808s">00:30:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"As long as we're married, it doesn't matter." And then I realized it mattered. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1812s">00:30:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ever since then, I've been trying to make it up, and we just haven't been able to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1817s">00:30:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because we had kids, right? So, next year will be really the first time that we're doing something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1824s">00:30:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're kind of, "What are we going to do with the kids? Are we going to take Isaiah? You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1828s">00:30:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how much is this going to cost? What are we going to do? When are we going to go?" And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1831s">00:30:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm constantly, every time I have, I'm trying to research, you know, "Can I save enough points? Can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1835s">00:30:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I do this and do that? What can I do?" You know? And so, even though it's six months or whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1840s">00:30:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">away, you know, my thoughts are on that, because I'm planning and preparing for that. Well, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1846s">00:30:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a Christian is somebody who believes in the promise of the coming kingdom. And so, as a result of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1854s">00:30:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">our mind is constantly set on the things of the Spirit. And somebody who's not, who doesn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1860s">00:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">faith, no matter how often you go to church, no matter what you do, your mind is constantly set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1864s">00:31:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the things, because this is where you belong. See, a Christian is somebody who heard the Gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1870s">00:31:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jesus Christ, and when he saw that, he believed. And he repented. He changed his mind. So, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1878s">00:31:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't repent, if your mind has not been changed, you wouldn't be a Christian. That's what Paul is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1883s">00:31:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">describing in Romans chapter 8. A person who has repented. And so, in Romans chapter 12, verse 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1889s">00:31:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">when he said, "Do not be conformed, but be transformed by," what? "Renewing of your mind." What does the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1894s">00:31:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">renewing of your mind literally mean? Repentant. Repenting. That our mind is constantly being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1903s">00:31:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">renewed and changed and revised. And that's what the Holy Spirit primarily does. That He comes into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1911s">00:31:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our lives, and He reminds us of what we have in Christ, and why He did it, and who He did it for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1918s">00:31:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I believe this. And I believe in the coming Kingdom. And as a result of that, my mind has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1925s">00:32:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">been washed. My brain has been washed. I'm brainwashed. Renewed. Repented. See, people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1935s">00:32:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fleshly is simply unrepentant. Unrepentant. There's nothing that has changed. Unchanged in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1943s">00:32:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, they are concerned about the fleshly things. And as a result of that, he says in verse 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1948s">00:32:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it leads ultimately to death. A fleshly mind is somebody who is already dead. Verse 7, their mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1955s">00:32:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is hostile to God. If your mind is constantly thinking about this world, and the benefits of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1961s">00:32:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this world, and this world only, he says you can't please God. You're hostile. Colossians 1:21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1967s">00:32:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil things." And the reason why they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1973s">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were doing evil things is because their mind is constantly thinking of things that are against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1976s">00:32:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">God. Not only that, in verse 7 it says, "It does not and cannot submit to the law of God." And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1983s">00:33:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe that Romans chapter 8 is describing that person. That no matter how much he desires it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1988s">00:33:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he cannot. And that's what he says in verse 7. He's not able to please God. In 1 Corinthians 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=1995s">00:33:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">14 and 16, he says, Paul says, "A natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2000s">00:33:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for they are folly to him.

You know, oftentimes, you know, one of the most common questions that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2030s">00:33:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">get from people is, "What is the will of the Lord? Should I marry her? Should I go here and do this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2037s">00:33:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that question can't be answered to somebody who is not already following the will of the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2043s">00:34:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If every other part of your life you're living independent from God, and because this is such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2050s">00:34:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an important decision, this one thing I want to get right. Everything else I just live independently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2055s">00:34:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">from God. But who I marry, I don't want to get this wrong, so I want His blessing upon this. He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2060s">00:34:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"You can't possibly know that." He said, "A mind who is fleshly is not able to discern the will of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2069s">00:34:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and nor can he even please God." You can do all these external things, but what God desires is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2075s">00:34:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">genuine worship. He says, "He can't please God." Therefore, again, they can't please God. But, he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2083s">00:34:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of a Christian, in verse 9, "You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit." And as a result of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2090s">00:34:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he says there, "You have life and peace." A person who has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit has life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2098s">00:34:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and peace. And you'll notice in the Scripture, life and peace always go hand in hand. Because the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2105s">00:35:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for peace for a Jew is "shalom." And the word "shalom," peace, is closely related to the word Sabbath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2113s">00:35:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews chapter 4, verse 9, he says, "So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For whoever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2118s">00:35:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from His." So, the Bible uses the term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2125s">00:35:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sabbath and salvation in similar terms. Because what was lost at the fall was when God entered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2133s">00:35:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into His Sabbath, when we rested and we were living there, when we sinned, He says, "You shall surely die."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2139s">00:35:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What did death look like? Separation. The Sabbath was broken. And ever since then, we're trying to, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2146s">00:35:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was trying to bring Christ to restore what? The Sabbath. So, he says, "A person who has the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2153s">00:35:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">has life and has Sabbath." Because the Holy Spirit, in verse 9, is indwelling in us. He's making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2161s">00:36:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">His dwelling in us. Verse 9, "You are not of the flesh of the Spirit, but in fact the Spirit of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2167s">00:36:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">dwells in you. And anyone who dwells not have the Spirit of Christ, does not belong to Him. But if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2172s">00:36:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2177s">00:36:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope if you guys were studying this passage this week that you saw that Christ and the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2184s">00:36:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is used interchangeably here. Did you catch that? Right? Remember we talked about the Holy Spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2189s">00:36:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea of the Trinity is very difficult to explain. But when you get into the Word, it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2194s">00:36:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly taught. He says that the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2199s">00:36:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ, He just says, "Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, does not belong to Him. But Christ is in you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2205s">00:36:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness." You notice that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2209s">00:36:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">God, Christ, Holy Spirit is all used interchangeably here. If you notice, John chapter 14, he said, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2217s">00:36:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if you go, how come we can't go with you?" And he said, "Do not worry. I will not leave you as orphans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2222s">00:37:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I go, the Helper is going to come." And then in chapter 15, he spends the whole chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2229s">00:37:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about, "You cannot bear fruit unless you will do what? Remain in me, continue in me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2234s">00:37:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he goes back to chapter 16, talking about the Holy Spirit. So chapter 14, he describes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2241s">00:37:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Holy Spirit. Chapter 16, he describes the Holy Spirit. And chapter 15, after promising them that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2247s">00:37:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to continue with them, he says, "You have to remain. If you're going to bear fruit, you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2252s">00:37:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">remain with me. Remain. To continue. To rest. To stay." So what Paul is saying here is exactly what John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2263s">00:37:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is saying, what he's been saying everywhere else. That the work of the Holy Spirit is to continually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2268s">00:37:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">connect us to Christ. That's the ultimate work of the Holy Spirit, is to continue to connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2276s">00:37:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">us with Christ. There is only one mediator between us and the Father, and that's Jesus Christ. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2285s">00:38:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing else in between. If we put anything else in between, if I just connect with the right person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2291s">00:38:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if I connect with the right program, if I was just, if I just went to the right seminary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2297s">00:38:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and suddenly we put something between us and Jesus, and we think, "Well, maybe the reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2304s">00:38:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is happening is because I lack this and this and this." And when the Holy Spirit says, "No, everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2309s">00:38:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that you need for the life of God has been given to you, and I'm not going to leave you as an orphan."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2314s">00:38:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The Holy Spirit, the Helper, the Spirit of the Truth, He's going to come and remind you of all that I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2319s">00:38:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">said to you. He's going to take the things that I have done, and He's going to convict the world of sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2324s">00:38:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and righteousness. So what is the work of the Holy Spirit? It's to connect us with Christ. A dynamic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2332s">00:38:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship with Jesus Christ. And He brings us back to His Word. It is His presence. Presence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2341s">00:39:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ in our life through the Holy Spirit. In fact, J.I. Packer says of the Holy Spirit, "The greatest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2348s">00:39:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">benefit of the gift of the Holy Spirit is simply His presence." His presence. That the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2356s">00:39:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is no longer coming and going. He's not anointing and leaving. He has made a permanent indwelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2364s">00:39:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The Scripture says that He was given to us as a deposit, guaranteeing our salvation. Deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2371s">00:39:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Permanently in us. Leading and guiding. So, rest of Chapter 8, He's going to go further into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2378s">00:39:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Into what does it mean for the Holy Spirit to intercede on our behalf? We're not going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2382s">00:39:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into that today. But it's if that Holy Spirit is in you, that same Spirit that raised Jesus from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2388s">00:39:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">dead will also raise you to eternal life. Let me wrap all this up so that we can get to the communion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2397s">00:39:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that at the end of the day, maybe it'd be easier if we had some sort of a Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2409s">00:40:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">encounter. And that's what I used to think too when I was younger. And so, I was thinking, when I was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2416s">00:40:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">younger Christian, or younger pastor, you know, I came from a charismatic background. That's why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2422s">00:40:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">got saved. Even though I grew up in a Presbyterian background, I got saved in a charismatic background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2427s">00:40:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, people were doing healing, you know, speaking in tongues, and all the things that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2432s">00:40:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know, the charismatics. Well, I fully gave myself to that because if that's the case, then I want it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2440s">00:40:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there are certain things that just didn't fit spiritually. Like, why are we speaking in tongues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2444s">00:40:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">out loud? And the Bible says that there needs to be an interpreter. And so, there's certain things in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2447s">00:40:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible that I didn't see fit. But at that time, there were healing services going all around. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2452s">00:40:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not like today. Right now, it's, you know, there's Seeker Friendly, or Reform, the Gospel Center</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2457s">00:40:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">movement. And there's different things going on right now. But at that time, it was predominantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2461s">00:41:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">vineyard, you know, like healing services on Sundays. So, people will go to a Presbyterian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2465s">00:41:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">service in the morning, and go to vineyard at night for healing service. So, I searched for five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2471s">00:41:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, looking. If you, if that's the power of the Holy Spirit, I want it. I mean, that would save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2478s">00:41:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">me a lot of time. A lot of time. Instead of expositing the Scripture and telling you about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2484s">00:41:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, I just knock you to the ground. Right? I mean, what Benny Hinn does, you know, sounds fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2493s">00:41:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Take off my jacket and just, and then go home. And revival breaks out. I mean, it'd be easy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2500s">00:41:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I said, "Man, if I had the gift of healing, if I can cast out demons, if I can do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2505s">00:41:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, why not? I don't see in the Bible, it says you can't happen. So, why not?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2509s">00:41:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I went to every service that had these services at vineyard. And I went, and I sat there. And one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2515s">00:41:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">time, I took the whole youth group. I think Elder Joe might have been there. I don't remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2519s">00:41:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I exposed our youth group to a lot of stuff. So, I would go to these services and look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2527s">00:42:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they, I remember this one particular service that John Wimber, who was the head pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2532s">00:42:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of that. And he said, "Well, there's 3,000 people in the room." And he said, "Anybody who hasn't seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2537s">00:42:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a miracle take place, come out." So, I went up, took the youth group up. And he had three, four people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2543s">00:42:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting up in the front. So, we sat with them. And I surrounded, we sat. And literally, I was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2548s">00:42:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this, this, this. I wanted front row seats. So, John Wimber came and laid hands. And he was walking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2553s">00:42:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's about four or five other people.

In Matthew chapter 28, 16 to 20, is a passage where Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2857s">00:47:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">gives the Great Commission, and it's something happened. We usually focus on verse 18 to 20. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2862s">00:47:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2867s">00:47:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted." So the Great Commission was given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2873s">00:47:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as a result of this phrase. It's because they doubted. And that's why he says, "All authority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2881s">00:48:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in heaven and earth has been given to me.

The reason why he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2892s">00:48:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me, and lo, I am with you to the end of the age,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2895s">00:48:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because he says they were worshipping him, and yet some doubted.

What were they doubting? They were already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/188777891#t=2907s">00:48:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">worshipping him.
