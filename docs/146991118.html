is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=205s">00:03:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of things that he mentions here, I think any one of us can read that and say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=210s">00:03:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I see cases of that in my

tendency to look at sin and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=217s">00:03:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, yeah, I made a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=220s">00:03:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a tendency, we have broad strokes of what sin is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=227s">00:03:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way God describes sin in the nation of Israel, his people, he doesn't simply say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"You didn't live up.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=240s">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a difference between a child of God who is maybe stumbling over certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=244s">00:04:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">things versus somebody who's sinning but maybe in rebellion against God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=250s">00:04:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But he is not Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span

just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=266s">00:04:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">gloss over and say, "Israel sinned, so therefore they got

judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=278s">00:04:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=279s">00:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember we talked about that last week, the first part of Isaiah chapter 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span

parts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=344s">00:05:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this that is corrupt, and there's other parts that are

href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1580s">00:26:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to see this theme as the rebellion against God described as arrogance, man's

human history, sin basically is a rebellion against God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1595s">00:26:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to

<span class="t">Some commentaries actually think that this was specifically given for women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1617s">00:26:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think it's only limited to women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1619s">00:26:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at all of this, men can, it can apply to men as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1625s">00:27:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, he's saying he's going to humble you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1627s">00:27:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything that kind of you adorned yourself to be proud in front of other people, God's going to strip that away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1636s">00:27:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">War will devastate the nation where there will be lack of men to marry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1639s">00:27:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at verse 25 through chapter 4, verse 1, "Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle, and her gates shall lament and mourn empty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1650s">00:27:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">She shall sit on the ground, and seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, 'We will eat our

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1662s">00:27:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the picture that we see here in verse 25, chapter 4, verse 1, is a result of battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1669s">00:27:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the marriable men basically have been either slaughtered or they've been taken into captivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1675s">00:27:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a result of that, the women are going to be staggering looking for men to marry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1680s">00:28:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not going to meet none.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1682s">00:28:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I was reading a commentary, and one of the commentaries said during World War II that over one million men were killed in Germany, and over 500,000 French men were killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1694s">00:28:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a huge number, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1696s">00:28:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, more than half of the men who were able to, during that period, were slaughtered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1703s">00:28:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the picture that we see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1707s">00:28:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, remember we talked about that like the goal of this is not simply to say, "Hey, here's judgment. This is why you're being judged."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1713s">00:28:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's very precise about that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1716s">00:28:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But along with that, his goal is to leave imprints of, "This is why judgment is coming, but this is the reason why Jesus is coming."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1725s">00:28:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, "God will not forsake them," verses, chapter 4, verses 2 to 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1731s">00:28:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The term "branch" comes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1735s">00:28:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"The branch of the Lord will be restored to its beauty and glory for the remnant of Israel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1740s">00:29:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you look at chapter 4, verse 2, in a context in itself, you can kind of mull and say, "Oh, the branch is talking about Jesus."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1748s">00:29:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why the branch is probably referring to Jesus is if you turn to chapter 11, turn to Isaiah chapter 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1762s">00:29:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at chapter 11, the term "branch" is used again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1766s">00:29:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from the roots shall bear fruit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1772s">00:29:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you keep reading, it is clearly talking about the coming of the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1776s">00:29:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's called the branch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1778s">00:29:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you come to chapter 3, it makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1781s">00:29:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, in the immediate context, we can't get that, "Oh, that's talking about the Messiah."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1785s">00:29:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But you'll see, starting from chapter 6 and 7, that the Messianic prophecies are going to start to come out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1791s">00:29:51.720</a></span> |

then so, as we start getting into the Messianic prophecies, there's going to be more details about his...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1820s">00:30:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there are more Messianic prophecies in the book of Isaiah than any other book.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/146991118#t=1836s">00:30:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here, the branch he's referring to is most likely talking about the coming of the Messiah.</span></div><div
