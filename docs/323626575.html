it, give some outlines, certain things to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=85s">00:01:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for so that you can

href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=132s">00:02:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so the first thing we want to look at is the hermeneutical principle and every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=137s">00:02:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">week we're looking through are there any kind of repeated words or phrases that give us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=141s">00:02:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some guidelines as to what you should be looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=145s">00:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the first things that I mentioned, if you look at the first page that was passed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=148s">00:02:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out, compare translations to see if there are words or phrases that have been translated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=154s">00:02:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">differently to clarify certain ambiguous references in the text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=158s">00:02:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the four translations that I usually look into is the NASV, ESV, NIV, and the KJV or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=166s">00:02:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the NKJV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=167s">00:02:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you have Bible programs or if you're online looking through translations, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=173s">00:02:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">probably find about 40 or 50 different translations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=176s">00:02:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need to be comparing all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=178s">00:02:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I choose these is because of the different philosophies that they used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=185s">00:03:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The first line is the literal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=188s">00:03:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">King James is the most literal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=189s">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">King James didn't care if you understood it or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=193s">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They just did not care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=195s">00:03:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if that's exactly what it means, that's exactly what they put in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=200s">00:03:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense in English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=203s">00:03:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason why I look at King James is when there's certain phrasing that's really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=210s">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really awkward, and even for King James sometimes, it's to the point where it makes no sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=216s">00:03:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=217s">00:03:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, King James, it's just put whatever was in Greek, they just put it in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=221s">00:03:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Even the word order, they follow the exact word order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=225s">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have a hard time understanding if something is awkward, you know there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=230s">00:03:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">something in the Greek that they had a hard time translating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=234s">00:03:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wasn't simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=235s">00:03:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it was, "I ate food," that's not hard to translate in any language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=241s">00:04:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the order of the verb and the subject, all of that may be twisted or maybe it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=246s">00:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">be in a different order, but that's not hard to translate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=249s">00:04:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you speak two languages or more languages, you know there are certain words or phrases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=254s">00:04:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you cannot translate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=257s">00:04:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so sometimes it would be a single word, but you would have to use a whole phrase to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=260s">00:04:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">translate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=263s">00:04:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Or sometimes it would be a phrase and there's a good word in the other language that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=267s">00:04:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize the meaning behind that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=269s">00:04:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So those of you who speak two languages, which probably many of us in this room, or at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=274s">00:04:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat, you know at least enough that there are certain words that just can't be translated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=280s">00:04:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=281s">00:04:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you compare the translations, you'll see that the words that are not easily translated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=289s">00:04:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">oftentimes you'll see the words differently in each translation or the phrase will come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=294s">00:04:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">out differently in each translation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=296s">00:04:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that some of you are already doing that, but that already tells you there's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=300s">00:05:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going on in the Greek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=301s">00:05:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it doesn't mean that there's hidden meaning, it just means that there wasn't an exact word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=308s">00:05:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that they could have used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=309s">00:05:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why there's debate as to well this word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=312s">00:05:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes it's good to look at all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=315s">00:05:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">A perfect example of the word is the word "meno".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=318s">00:05:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It means to abide, and the word abide has many different facets of that word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=325s">00:05:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you look at the different translations, it'll say "remain", "to continue", "to abide",</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=330s">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of that combined is the meaning of that word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=334s">00:05:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So each translation only picked one that they thought would capture to the best of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=339s">00:05:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=340s">00:05:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you really want to know, you have to know the meaning behind all of it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=343s">00:05:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that word encompasses all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=346s">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think getting in the habit of comparing translations is a good way to study the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=353s">00:05:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So now it's online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=355s">00:05:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So before I used to have a Bible that had four translations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/323626575#t=360s">00:06:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically New Testament was this thick because it
