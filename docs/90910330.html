class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=9s">00:00:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was this individual who was so disturbed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=13s">00:00:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it happened to be in an environment where I went to a Christian debate, somebody who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=19s">00:00:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was extremely well versed, someone who had a lot of earthly accolades in terms of education,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=25s">00:00:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he had a PhD, and he was debating a non-Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=29s">00:00:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they had one of those Q&A times at the end of the debate, and there was this man</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=34s">00:00:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who was so disturbed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=35s">00:00:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And his question was essentially this, "How in the world do angels fall?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=42s">00:00:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And his question was basically, "How does an angel who sees God, the power of God, decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=50s">00:00:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">either not to believe or to rebel?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=53s">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he followed up by saying, "If an angel who was in the presence of God thus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=58s">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">decided to rebel, what prevents me, if I become Christian, what prevents me from falling subsequently?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=66s">00:01:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What prevents me from falling away from the faith, so to speak?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=68s">00:01:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What prevents me from losing my salvation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=71s">00:01:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And is there any security, even if I go to heaven and become a glorified being, or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=76s">00:01:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">even become an angel," he said, "that I would remain with God forever?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=81s">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was really interesting to me was that there was no answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=84s">00:01:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the time, I was only in high school, I was a senior in high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=88s">00:01:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it really perplexed everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=92s">00:01:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the guy was literally almost in tears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=96s">00:01:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I found really interesting about that is, does the Scripture have something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=99s">00:01:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to answer for that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=101s">00:01:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe not about the angels, but at least for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=104s">00:01:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">At least for us, is there any kind of security?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=108s">00:01:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the dilemma, the problem is this, is that on one end, you have this guy who is almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=113s">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "I don't want to get into something that's not going to last forever."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=116s">00:01:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or he's doubting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=117s">00:01:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If angels can fall, then what about us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=119s">00:01:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's essentially in a state of, again, both fear and being perplexed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=124s">00:02:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the dilemma is, you have people on the opposite spectrum of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=129s">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once saved, always saved, don't ever make me doubt my salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=133s">00:02:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm gold, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=135s">00:02:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are preachers who would say, "What the point of Christianity is, is that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=140s">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">would have assurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=142s">00:02:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So therefore, right now, everyone, don't you dare, don't you dare doubt whether you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=148s">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">truly saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=149s">00:02:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You are saved, you're going to be saved, and you're always going to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=152s">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No matter what you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=153s">00:02:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not about what you do, it's absolutely nothing about what you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=155s">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">No matter how far you fall, you will never be lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=158s">00:02:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that kind of idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=161s">00:02:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the dilemma is essentially, you have two extremes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=164s">00:02:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Where one, too much fear, the other, they don't care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=168s">00:02:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, how do we address this topic, biblically?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=172s">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today we're going to be talking about the perseverance of the saints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=176s">00:02:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=178s">00:02:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do want you guys to take note of the fact that, you know, in our theology class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be talking about it in those terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=187s">00:03:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Perseverance of the saints, as opposed to some well-known terms that people use, such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=191s">00:03:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as eternal security.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=195s">00:03:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or little, like, cliche phrases such as, "One saved, always saved."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90910330#t=201s">00:03:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I want you to turn your Bibles to a very pivotal passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
