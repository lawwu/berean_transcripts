All right.    Wait, Alyssa, you know intro for this song? Okay.    >> Hey, no one heard that.  >> Hey, Alyssa, how about you play like that first line, and then I'll come in the second time, and then we'll start.                    >> I think after the bridge, we're gonna cut out.  And then the chorus, the first part of the chorus, we're gonna play quiet and build up to end the chorus. So bridge four times, and then we'll pause.  After the bridge, just pause on the B minor, and then we're gonna pause and then go back to the chorus, so I'll play it.       >> Let's go right back into the, okay. Let's try the bridge from the beginning, so all four times.  >> Yeah, we'll just go right back and forth.  >> Okay, beginning of bridge.         >> Yeah, we'll just go back full into the chorus. Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's try bridge one more time, and then we'll be good.                         >> Hey, we're gonna go back to There's a Fountain one more time.                                                                                                 >> We can just find our seats and take a couple minutes to pray to prepare for worship. >> We can just find our seats and take a couple minutes to pray to prepare for worship. >> We can just find our seats and take a couple minutes to pray to prepare for worship. >> We can just find our seats and take a couple minutes to pray to prepare for worship. >> We can just find our seats and take a couple minutes to pray to prepare for worship. >> Heavenly Father, we just thank you for bringing us here tonight. We thank you for the privilege that it is to worship you freely. We thank you for the privilege that it is to worship you freely. We thank you for the privilege that it is to worship you freely. >> We all stand for time of worship.                                                         >> All right. Well, good evening, everybody. So it's been a couple of weeks. And just by way of review, the tail end of last week, or last times Bible study, and because there's a therefore that starts off today's passage, I wanna actually backtrack a little bit and read for you from verse 22 of chapter 1. All the blue that's there, those are the Old Testament quotations, and there's four in today's passage, five on the screen in front of you. So I just did that so your eyes can kind of visualize just the quotes. But here we go, let me read verses 22 all the way to 2.8. Since you have an obedience to the truth, purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you've been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is through the living and enduring word of God. For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word which was preached to you. Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. And coming to him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also as living stones are being built up as a spiritual house for a royal priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in scripture, behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious cornerstone, and he who believes in him will not be disappointed. This precious value then is for you who believe, but for those who disbelieve, the stone which the builders rejected, this became the very cornerstone. And a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word. And to this doom they were also appointed. So you guys know the drill. You want to share verses 1 through 8, your observations. And it's a lot, right? There's a lot of verses. And so normally chapters 2, 1 through 3 would have been a study, and then 4 through 12 would have been a study, but we kind of are trying to squeeze in the whole book in 17 weeks, so we have this weird week. But share what you've gleaned from verses 1 through 8. And question number 3, if you have time or as you go through it, you can share what is the significance of these series of Old Testament references, okay? And there's going to be many more in the book of 1 Peter, so what's the significance? So what I will do is we'll pray, dismiss, and then at 820 we'll come back and resume for a time of just wrap-up. All right, let me pray for us. Father, help us to just not take lightly the truths that we see in the Scriptures, and as we learn them, cause us to examine our hearts, to repent of the areas where we really need to just leave our former life of sin. And I pray, Father, for your strength to apply and apply well. And I pray that as we discuss, as we share, Lord, would you really cause us all just to long to know you fully through the time together. I pray for a good time of discussion, ease of fellowship, and we pray for just your protection and provision over our time together. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. All right, see you guys at 820.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           >> Let me pray for us and then we will go into our time of wrap up. I pray that you would help us to wrap our minds around and to fully process and understand. I pray that you would cause us to long and to crave so that we may grow. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. I pray that you would cause us to be more and more Christ like and useful. >> I want to thank you for this opportunity to share with you a story.
