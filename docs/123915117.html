These are what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=51s">00:00:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we value and these are the reasons why we do what we do, why our worship is done the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=56s">00:00:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">way we do, why we have certain people serve the way we serve. And so all of these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=61s">00:01:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are foundational to our church. And again, bringing community to church is not unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=66s">00:01:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the sense that we have this vision. This is not something that we just kind of sat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=69s">00:01:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in a circle and had the leader say, Hey, what do we want our church to be about? This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=75s">00:01:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">true of every single church. We just decided to write this down and to be deliberate about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=79s">00:01:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to pursue it. And so we want to make sure that every person in the church, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=83s">00:01:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">whether you're coming in or you've been here for a while to remind the church that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=87s">00:01:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is who we are, this is what God has given us, and this is what we're pursuing. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=92s">00:01:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">every year, so we can be reminded and pursue this together as a foundation. So for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=96s">00:01:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">next four weeks that I'm up here, so this week and the next week, Pastor Alex is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=100s">00:01:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to be here and week after that is Easter. But the next four times that I'm up here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=103s">00:01:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">including today, we're going to be going over the fourfold vision of the church. So I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=106s">00:01:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to read the fourfold vision again. And I know everybody who went through BCC goes through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=111s">00:01:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this. And if you've been here for a while, hopefully you have it memorized by now. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=116s">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">basically our vision is to glorify God by establishing one, a church that engages, engages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=124s">00:02:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in God-centered worship, not man-centered. And so that's what we're going to be focused</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=127s">00:02:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on today. Second vision, a church that equips every believer with God's inerrant word. Third,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=134s">00:02:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a church that builds a community through love and accountability. Fourth, a church that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=139s">00:02:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reaches out to its community with the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so each one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=144s">00:02:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">visions are things that we examine and evaluate the church. What are we weak in? What are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=149s">00:02:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">some things that we kind of drifted out in? Are we in need of a stronger community? Are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=154s">00:02:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we in need of better outreach? So last couple of years, we've been focused on missions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=158s">00:02:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">evangelism. A couple of years prior to that, we've been focused on prayer. And again, we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=164s">00:02:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">been focused on evangelism missions for a while, but every year we try to evaluate and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=168s">00:02:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to see what areas of the church that we need to focus on. And so we evaluate this again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=174s">00:02:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on a yearly basis. And that's why we kind of project our retreats, our Bible studies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=179s">00:02:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and certain sermons to address some of these issues. So again, so today we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=184s">00:03:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be focused on worship. Why is God-centered worship so essential to our church? So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=189s">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to read the text. I'm not going to be in this text, but just to just kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=193s">00:03:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a platform foundation for us to build upon John chapter four, verses 21 through 24. Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=200s">00:03:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=205s">00:03:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You will worship what you do not know. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=210s">00:03:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming and now is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=214s">00:03:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=219s">00:03:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Father is seeking such people to worship Him. God is spirit and those who worship Him must</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=224s">00:03:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">worship in spirit and in truth." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=231s">00:03:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We pray for your blessing upon this time that your word would go forth, Lord God, powerfully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=237s">00:03:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that you would give us fertile hearts, Lord, that it may bear fruit. We pray for your blessing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=242s">00:04:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and the power of your Holy Spirit to accompany the preaching of your word. In Jesus' name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=247s">00:04:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we pray, amen. If you've ever read through the book of Judges, sometimes you can read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=254s">00:04:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that book and kind of get lost because you see sins being repeated and God restoring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=259s">00:04:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them back and forth and you see a cycle of this over and over. But there's one theme</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=264s">00:04:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the book of Judges and it kind of captures the period of Israel's history where they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=269s">00:04:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">were constantly just doing their own thing. In Judges 17, 6, it kind of captures the theme</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=276s">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the book of Judges and it kind of captures the attitude of the Israelites during that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=279s">00:04:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">period. It says, "In those days there were no kings in Israel. Everyone did what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=285s">00:04:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right in his own eyes." So, that kind of captures the attitude of the Israelites during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=291s">00:04:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that period. So, if you've ever read the book of Judges, you know that there's a constant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=295s">00:04:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cycle of sinning against God, God bringing judgment through a foreign nation or a foreign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=301s">00:05:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">God or some other power and they would be under their subjection, they cry out to God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=306s">00:05:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He sends a judge to deliver them and then after they get delivered, soon after that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=310s">00:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they start to fall and forget about God and this cycle goes over and over again. And at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=315s">00:05:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of the book it's just kind of like you get to a point where you just throw up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=318s">00:05:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">your hand, when are these people going to learn? But again the theme of Israelites is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=324s">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that they just kept on doing what they thought was right in their own eyes. It doesn't say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=330s">00:05:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that they came out and they decided, "Ah, we're not going to worship Yahweh anymore."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=334s">00:05:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to bring an average Jew at that time and say, "You know, who is your God?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=338s">00:05:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They would have told you, "Yahweh is our God.

But the problem with what they were doing was they just worshipped Yahweh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=348s">00:05:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the way they wanted to. And so they just kind of went along with whatever they thought was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=353s">00:05:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right in their own mind, they just went along and did that and then it incurred God's wrath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=358s">00:05:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">upon them because of that. You know, today there's so much confusion as to what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=365s">00:06:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of the church. You know, there's all kinds of conferences going on, how to grow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=371s">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the church, how to reach our generation, how to be effective. You know, there's all kinds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=375s">00:06:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of conferences and meetings going on about that.

Today, if a church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=398s">00:06:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">down the street is growing large, it has 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, automatically we look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=405s">00:06:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">at that and say, "Well, what are they doing? What are they doing right that they're attracting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=409s">00:06:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all these people? What is that doing? How are they preaching? How is their church organized?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=415s">00:06:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And immediately that gets duplicated and then it just kind of gets multiplied. Not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=420s">00:07:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">locally but nationally and oftentimes internationally. And the only criteria as to duplicating that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=428s">00:07:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's growing. It's huge. It's attracting a lot of people. And there's a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=434s">00:07:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">saying good things about it. But we know from scripture that at the peak of Jesus' ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=441s">00:07:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">when He fed the 5,000, the actual number probably closer to 20,000 people and it could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=447s">00:07:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kept on growing. But Jesus straight up says, "You have to eat my flesh and drink of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=452s">00:07:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">blood." And He says something very strange. It would have been, if they misunderstood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=457s">00:07:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what He was saying, it would have actually been blasphemous for Him to say that. Yet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=462s">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He deliberately does that because He says He knew what was in their heart because what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=464s">00:07:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus was looking for was true worshipers. Just like Jesus said to the Samaritan woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=472s">00:07:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not looking for the crowd. He's looking for true worshipers. What God desires is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=478s">00:07:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to fill the church. Not that He doesn't care about the multitudes because He sends us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=483s">00:08:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">make disciples of all the nations. But His greatest desire is to have genuine worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=491s">00:08:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A. W. Tozer says this about worship, the importance of worship in the church. He says, "Worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=496s">00:08:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is the reason why Christ came. Worship is the reason He was crucified and worship was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=501s">00:08:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason He rose again." Now you can't exaggerate what he's saying. Basically he's saying Christianity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=507s">00:08:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is about worship. The reason why He was incarnate was for the purpose of worship. The reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=511s">00:08:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">why He died was for the worship. The reason why He was resurrected was for the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=516s">00:08:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of worship. Our modern day, our more recent writing from John Piper in Let the Nations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=522s">00:08:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Be Glad, and I'm sure many of you have read that book, and he says, "Missions exist because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=527s">00:08:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">worship doesn't." So he says it in a little bit more concise manner. Basically what Piper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=532s">00:08:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is saying is the same thing that A. W. Tozer is saying. That the central thing about Christianity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=539s">00:08:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the central thing about my walk with God is about worship. Without worship, if we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=546s">00:09:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">worship wrong, or if it's superficial, or if it's a worship that God rejects, everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=552s">00:09:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're doing here this morning, everything we've done up to this point, everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=555s">00:09:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we will do from this point on would be for nothing. So it's extremely important for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=561s">00:09:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What does God mean by that? In fact, if you look at the beginning of the nation of Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=569s">00:09:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">when Moses comes back to God and says, "God, if you send me to Pharaoh," and they say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=573s">00:09:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"What do you want from me? What do I say to him?" And this is what God says to Abraham</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=579s">00:09:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in Exodus 7, 16. "Then he said to him, 'The Lord, the God of Hebrews, has sent me to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=584s">00:09:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to you, 'Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the desert.'" In the NIV, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=591s">00:09:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">says "worship." In some of your other translations, it'll say "serve." But the Hebrew word for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=596s">00:09:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that word is also translated "worship" or "serve." It's the same word. But he repeats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=601s">00:10:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that phrase over and over again. Why does the nation of Israel need to have freedom?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=607s">00:10:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Why they need to be delivered? He says that same phrase, "so that they may come out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=610s">00:10:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">worship me." He says it in Exodus 7, 16. He says it in Exodus 8, 1, in verse 20. Chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=617s">00:10:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">9, verse 1. Chapter 9, 13. Chapter 10, verse 3. Chapter 10, verse 7. Chapter 28, verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=623s">00:10:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">41. Chapter 29, verse 1. And I could go on and on and on and on. He repeats that phrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=630s">00:10:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple times, over and over again. That this is why the nation needs to be set free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=635s">00:10:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It is so that they may come and worship me. If you look at the Ten Commandments, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=641s">00:10:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is the first of the Ten Commandments? "You shall worship no other gods." So if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=647s">00:10:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to turn that and to understand it properly, biblically, what is he saying? That we ought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=652s">00:10:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to worship God and God alone. So the first commandment of the Ten Commandments is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=658s">00:10:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">worshiping Him. But it's not just the first commandment. If you look at the first four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=663s">00:11:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">commandments, it relates to our relationship with God. If you look at the second six commandments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=668s">00:11:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about our relationship with one another. But all four commandments of the first, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=673s">00:11:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Ten Commandments, is about worship. One is that you will worship no other gods. Second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=678s">00:11:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that you will have no graven images of me. In other words, you won't worship me in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=683s">00:11:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">form of another thing. The third one is not to take His name in vain. Meaning that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=690s">00:11:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">don't approach God and you don't use His name in worship in the wrong way. Fourth commandment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=695s">00:11:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"Thou shalt keep the Sabbath holy." What does it mean to keep it holy? To set it apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=700s">00:11:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That it is a day of corporate worship. So all four commandments given to us in the Ten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=705s">00:11:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Commandments is about giving proper worship to God. So it is no surprise to us when Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=712s">00:11:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has this encounter with the Samaritan woman. The Samaritan woman says, "You know, you seem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=719s">00:11:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like a prophet. You seem like you have the truth." And then she says, "Well, you Jews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=723s">00:12:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">say that you're going to worship here and we worship in this mountain. And who's true?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=728s">00:12:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus' response to her is, "If you're asking for who's right and who's wrong, right, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=732s">00:12:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">has the truth and who doesn't have the truth, the Jews have the truth. They have the law</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=736s">00:12:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of God." So if you're trying to see like are the Jews right? Are the Samaritans right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=741s">00:12:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They have the law of God. But a time is coming and has already come that God is not looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=747s">00:12:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to see who has the right doctrine only. That whether if you worship at the temple God is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=752s">00:12:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pleased and if you worship on this mountain that God is not pleased. The time is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=757s">00:12:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and has now come that true worshipers will worship Him in spirit and in truth. Meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=763s">00:12:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you may have the right heart but you don't have the truth. The Jews may have the truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=768s">00:12:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but they don't have the right heart. What God is looking for are people who will worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=772s">00:12:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Him in spirit and in truth. And so it should be no surprise to us that worshipping God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=780s">00:13:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is at the center of what we're doing. You know there was a time where I thought that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=786s">00:13:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the primary reason why we got together is for the purpose of discipleship and evangelism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=791s">00:13:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized as I was studying through scripture that that is not it. Without proper worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=797s">00:13:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">evangelism is fruitless. Without genuine worship our prayers become frustrated. Without genuine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=806s">00:13:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">worship our service eventually becomes a burden. Without proper worship our fellowship eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=813s">00:13:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes old.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=817s">00:13:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">some people happen to be better at others.

But true fruit always comes as a result of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=833s">00:13:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">true worship. And that's why the first of the four visions of our church is really all-encompassing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=841s">00:14:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if we don't have the first one, the second, third, fourth thing that we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/123915117#t=845s">00:14:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to pursue we pursue out of our own strength and eventually they'll get frustrated.
