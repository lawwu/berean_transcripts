Then what I'd like to do is read our passage together over in verse 16</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=13s">00:00:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of chapter 3 down to verse 23. And it says, "Do you not know that you are a temple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=25s">00:00:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=32s">00:00:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are. Let no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=37s">00:00:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=42s">00:00:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">become foolish, so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=47s">00:00:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">before God. For it is written, 'He is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness.'</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=53s">00:00:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that they are useless. So then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=59s">00:00:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let no one boast in men, for all things belong to you. Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=65s">00:01:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all things belong to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=72s">00:01:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God." Okay. So, in that passage, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=82s">00:01:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">guys can tell the flow of thought, he's still talking about the issue in the church of division.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=89s">00:01:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? And in addressing this topic, man, he's used so many different types of arguments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=94s">00:01:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and different types of reasoning. Okay? So today, we're going to take a look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=99s">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">portion as one segment in that larger argument. Okay? I want to start off by giving an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=108s">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">introduction. I'm currently living in my father-in-law's home, and that has proven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=115s">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to be quite the interesting thing. Thank goodness he's an extremely godly man. He's like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=120s">00:02:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">elder at his church. He's actually like a member of the Korean Presbyterian Synod in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=125s">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Southern California, and he's like a really authoritative, strong individual. So, whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=132s">00:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he says kind of goes. Now, you can imagine how that could create some, even though he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=138s">00:02:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is godly and even though he's extremely generous and kind, how that can create confusion, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=143s">00:02:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that can create perhaps awkwardness and also a sense of, "I don't know what I'm supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=147s">00:02:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do." You know? Hence, I'm looking for a place to go. I'm just kidding. It's been awesome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=153s">00:02:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">living there, and again, they've been so generous. It's been amazing. But being that culturally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=161s">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's differences too. For example, the way that I grew up, my parents, they're like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=167s">00:02:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">OG Korean, first generation, everything's old school. So, essentially, the hierarchy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=173s">00:02:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">amongst parents and children is pretty, pretty severe. So, when they say, "No, this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=180s">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">way it should be," you correcting them would be like, "How dare you?" You know? It'd be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=185s">00:03:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. Whereas, Bia, what's really weird about it is, you know, they're Korean, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=192s">00:03:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they grew up in Brazil. So, it's just like a completely different environment. So, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=199s">00:03:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all kinds of confusions. For example, you know, obviously, if we go out and maybe I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=205s">00:03:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">want to pay for it, but then the father says, "No." I have to decide, do I push the issue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=211s">00:03:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and be like, "No, no, no, I'll pay. I'm so thankful for what you've been doing. Let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=214s">00:03:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">pay for the thing." Or if he says, "No," should I be respectful and be like, "Okay, you pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=219s">00:03:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for it." You know? Other times when certain things happen, Bia recently twisted her ankle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=223s">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">She couldn't do something and then she asked for help. I saw her dad get up, but then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=228s">00:03:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">want to get up because I'm her husband and it's kind of like, "What do I do?" You know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=233s">00:03:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, my mind works extremely slow and my gears have to start going. So, I sit there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=238s">00:03:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm like, "What's wrong with you?" And the reason why I'm bringing these scenarios</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=248s">00:04:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">up is because how do you decide what to do? You know? As a matter of fact, not in just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those scenarios, but in different scenarios, there's always a question of how do I decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=258s">00:04:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what to do in this context, right? And sometimes, especially if there are different role-playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=265s">00:04:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">figures in the scenario, it gets really complicated, right? Well, I talked to Bia about it one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=271s">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">time and I said, "Sometimes I don't know what to do." And she just straight-up looked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=274s">00:04:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">me and said, "But you're my husband." I said, "Okay." You know? Like, that just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=278s">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">clarifies what she expects in the moment. And that totally makes sense, right? She stubs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=284s">00:04:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">her toe or breaks her ankle, who should be the one running down to help her? Well, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=289s">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">she was a single lady, it would be her father. But, now that she's married, it should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=295s">00:04:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">me. Why? Because that's who I am. I bring that up because I think Apostle Paul, in trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=301s">00:05:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to challenge the church, like, there are certain ways you should behave in the church, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=307s">00:05:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are certain things you shouldn't be doing in the church. And a lot of it, his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=311s">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">rationale or the way that he argues with the people of the church is, "Because this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=316s">00:05:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">who you are. Live up to who you are." And if you know, you guys read other epistles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=322s">00:05:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's written, the letters that he's written, and a lot of times he writes in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=327s">00:05:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Be who you are. Live up to your calling. Function, behave, believe according to what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=334s">00:05:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">God has made you now." Right? And so it makes sense that from the beginning of the letter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=339s">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how did he begin? "Come on, saints!" You know? You almost hear the frustration, but he begins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=346s">00:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with saying, "Saints, brothers!" And then so he'll start arguing. Well, this section</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=352s">00:05:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to me is really one of those sections where he says, "Live up to who you are." And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=358s">00:05:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he begins by saying, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=366s">00:06:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=371s">00:06:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." See that? So there's an emphatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=378s">00:06:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">point, him saying, "This is who you are. Think about it." So let's think. First section,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=385s">00:06:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">little phrase, "You are the temple of God." Right? Now I want to just get this out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=390s">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the way. When he says, "You are the temple of God," is it you? So it's like, "Hey, don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=394s">00:06:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">get that tattoo, because you're the temple of God." Or is it you, as in y'all? Y'all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=400s">00:06:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are the temple of God. So don't fight each other in the church. Don't do this and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=406s">00:06:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and this stuff in the church. I don't know. So for you guys, what do you guys think? Just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=417s">00:06:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">getting this out of the way of what's the more, I guess, best way to look at that? Plural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=423s">00:07:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or singular? I see him pointing. Plural. Okay. So how do you kind of conclude to, "Hey, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=432s">00:07:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">think he's talking about the plural here." Awesome. So you can look at the Greek. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=442s">00:07:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the interesting thing, okay? So I personally believe that obviously sometimes I mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=448s">00:07:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Greek and I don't. I think it's good for us to realize obviously the Bible is written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=453s">00:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in Greek and we should go to the Greek because, number one, that's the way it was written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=458s">00:07:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, the Greek is a much more precise language. And because we believe in this inspiration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=465s">00:07:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and inerrancy of scripture, we believe that in the original manuscripts there's just no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=470s">00:07:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">error. It's not going to mislead us. It's going to trick us. So jot this down just for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=474s">00:07:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your reference. There's a website called blueletterbible.com. You don't have to be a professor in Greek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=480s">00:08:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to use that because it just tells you, you look at a word and it'll do the whole parsing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=484s">00:08:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. Parsing just saying, it'll tell you what kind of word it is. Plural, singular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=489s">00:08:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what case. Now, I don't think you should try to make huge theological movements from like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=497s">00:08:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one word or one Greek letter, all that kind of stuff. But it's good for us to know, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=502s">00:08:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't want to, again, make more than it is of it. But this is something good to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=506s">00:08:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">know. The passage, yes, in the Greek it's plural, okay? And so not only that, but from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=512s">00:08:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the context we understand that he is addressing the church at large and he's addressing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=517s">00:08:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">church writing this letter saying, you guys have division in the church. You are the temple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=524s">00:08:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">okay? So in addressing the church together then, it helps us think about the analogy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=531s">00:08:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so my question to you is, what about this analogy then as a temple correlates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=537s">00:08:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to y'all, the church at large? What did you guys discuss at the beginning of that? Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=546s">00:09:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> [INAUDIBLE]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=556s">00:09:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=563s">00:09:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> [INAUDIBLE]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=575s">00:09:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=576s">00:09:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> [INAUDIBLE]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=588s">00:09:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Great. That's a great case for looking at the context and then how he's addressing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=593s">00:09:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the church. Awesome. What other things did you kind of deduce about, okay, how is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=599s">00:09:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">analogy working? Meaning, what elements of the temple or the church is he correlating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=605s">00:10:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, hey, you're the temple? What sort of things did you guys talk about in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=618s">00:10:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">groups? How about calling on somebody? Hmm. Jen Chung.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=644s">00:10:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Thank you. All right. Anything else you guys want to highlight? Okay. Let's do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=657s">00:10:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">some more observation and then we're going to try to look at this stuff, okay? The next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=662s">00:11:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">question I have is, okay, thinking about this whole temple analogy, for me, meditating about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=668s">00:11:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this analogy is going to make for a lot of application. It's going to make for a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=673s">00:11:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of evaluation of how we function as a church, what we do, right? And so kind of giving more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=679s">00:11:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">detail to that, I want to ask you, when Apostle Paul is writing to this church, remember at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=684s">00:11:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the beginning I said this church has a mixture, okay? There's probably a good presence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=688s">00:11:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Jews. There's obviously being in Corinth, it has a great presence of Gentiles and whatnot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=693s">00:11:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But how would the Jews think about the temple when Apostle Paul brings this up and kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=700s">00:11:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of emphatically says, well, you guys are the temple. And he's now talking to this, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=705s">00:11:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know, new covenant after Christ church, but he's pointing back and saying, you're the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=711s">00:11:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">temple. How would the Jews perceive that? What are some of the first impressions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=717s">00:11:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thoughts that they would have? Aspect of holiness. Okay. So definitely for like a Jewish, Jewish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=729s">00:12:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">individual, they're thinking about temple. Everything has to be holy. Everything has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=734s">00:12:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to be consecrated. Everything has to be cleansed. Right? So definitely a Jew would be thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=739s">00:12:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like this place is holy. Okay. What else? What kind of things would they, would they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=745s">00:12:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">think of it when they think of the temple? God's presence, right? Because historically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=757s">00:12:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where do you go to meet God? The temple. You don't go on a random place. As a matter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=764s">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, if you did, you get judged. You don't go whenever you want to. You don't go to different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=768s">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hilltops. You don't go just make a little ditch at your home. You have to make that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=773s">00:12:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pilgrimage to the temple. Why? Because that's where God has ordained to meet his people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=778s">00:12:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that's a lot of interesting things we can, we can think about. And so here, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=785s">00:13:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what I'm talking about. If you were to take the time to meditate as to he's building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=791s">00:13:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a metaphor. Now, typically anytime the scriptures use a metaphor, we can't necessarily sit there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=800s">00:13:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and make all kinds of extrapolations from one metaphor. Why? Because typically the metaphor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=806s">00:13:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is trying to prove a point. A parable, a story, an illustration is typically trying to what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=812s">00:13:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Prove a point. Right? So here I believe there's a sense in which he says you're the temple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=817s">00:13:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the spirit dwells in you. Okay? And that's highlighting a point. But first I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=824s">00:13:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ask in what way does the spirit dwell in us? Well, let me have some of you guys read some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=829s">00:13:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the cross references that are listed there. If I can have Isaac, can you look up first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=834s">00:13:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter chapter two verse five? Andy, can you look up the next one? Ephesians 22. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=842s">00:14:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Alex, a kindle. Can you look up second Corinthians six 16 Jason, can you look up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=848s">00:14:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans chapter eight, first nine and 11 and then going down the line, maybe 10. Can you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=857s">00:14:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">look up second Timothy one 14 and then Martin, if you can look up Ezekiel chapter 37 verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=864s">00:14:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">27 as they're looking that up, I want to encourage you guys when you do your Bible studies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=869s">00:14:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there's a lot you can learn just from like a Bible that just has references</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=875s">00:14:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't have to, you know, buy all the commentaries and you don't have to buy all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=881s">00:14:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the latest like study Bibles. Why? Because sometimes you're studying a passage and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=887s">00:14:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">look up other areas in the scriptures that teach the same thing. You look up cross references</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=891s">00:14:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and it helps just a lot. Okay. So starting from Isaac. Okay. So if we were to summarize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=909s">00:15:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that, I would say spiritual house for worship. Sorry, I know the line's kind of short, spiritual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=915s">00:15:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">house for worship. Is that sufficient? Right? Like who are we? He says, you're being built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=920s">00:15:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">up like a spiritual house for worship. You're a bunch of priests offering up sacrifices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=925s">00:15:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Kind of interesting that Peter would also give old Testament analogy for what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=931s">00:15:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing in the new Testament church. Next one. Ephesians 22 or 222. Okay. So dwelling place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=945s">00:15:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of God. Okay. The church has being built up. Is it built up? You know, sometimes we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=952s">00:15:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the analogy that the church is the extension, the church is the vehicle, the church is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=957s">00:15:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hand of God, church is the ministry, the program. We use all different types of terms to describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=962s">00:16:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the church. Here it's emphasizing this fact that God is building a dwelling place for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=967s">00:16:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his presence. Next one. Second Corinthians. Who did I ask? Alex. Okay. What version are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=984s">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you reading? ESV? Okay. You guys can write in there again. Holy temple. Just temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=993s">00:16:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Next one. Romans eight. Okay. Thank you. So this passage we're talking about dwelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1022s">00:17:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how does the spirit dwell in you? And here, rather than the collective, he is talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1027s">00:17:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about the individual. So you can write dwells individually. Okay. The spirit dwells individually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1036s">00:17:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. Okay. Second Timothy chapter one verse 14. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1049s">00:17:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">says by the spirit, you guard the good deposit. So in many ways, this idea of dwelling is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1056s">00:17:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">also protective. Okay. So you can write as a shelter or just protective. Okay. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1064s">00:17:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">last one. Ezekiel. Okay. Thank you. That passage in Ezekiel is a pretty astounding one. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1076s">00:17:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about the new covenant and the change of heart that God is going to enact. Now I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1080s">00:18:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know that was kind of a, somewhat of a tedious exercise, like looking up different verses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1085s">00:18:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but for me, I just want us to sit and meditate and think about this truth. That God so desired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1095s">00:18:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this emphatic truth to be repeated so many times, which is that the spirit dwells in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1102s">00:18:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you, right? The spirit dwells in you. So meditate about this, that the spirit dwells in you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1111s">00:18:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in a sense in which through the offering, through the worship, through, through who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1116s">00:18:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we are, the spirit dwells in you as a, as a sanctifying, Holy presence. The spirit dwells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1123s">00:18:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in us collectively that we talked about already as a temple, but individually, the spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1128s">00:18:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">dwells in order to protect and guard. The spirit dwells just to emphasize this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1135s">00:18:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">His presence is with us, right? Okay. So as we think about that, I want you to think back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1145s">00:19:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to this idea again, to a Jew, the temple meant presence of God. So by ramification, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1155s">00:19:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would it, what would it translate to if they brought unholy animal, if they brought sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1162s">00:19:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">into the temple, how would they view that? Again, I'm at, sometimes I just ask obvious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1176s">00:19:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that it's just, you know, you know, the answer just want someone to say it, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1182s">00:19:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know, how would someone view bringing anything unholy into the temple for a Jew? Yeah. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1195s">00:19:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">flat out just defilement, right? Something like completely sacrilege and, and towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1201s">00:20:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">God, they would feel what? Sense of this like, wow, this is blasphemous, you know, they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1211s">00:20:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have a sense of, oh my gosh, we're offending God, you know, and just meditate on that for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1216s">00:20:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a second. Apostle Paul is bringing an analogy and this analogy or this metaphor is supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1221s">00:20:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to have its effect. You're a temple. Remember all that your fathers, forefathers had gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1227s">00:20:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">through? Remember all that was taught to your forefathers through the law? Remember all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1231s">00:20:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the experiences? Remember the people who offered strange sacrifices? Remember the people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1236s">00:20:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">brought in prostitutes to the temple? What did God do? You are this temple and it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1242s">00:20:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">emphatic point is the Holy Spirit is in there among you, in you, therefore, therefore what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1251s">00:20:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It must be holy. And so to me, the metaphor and how he builds it up is it all makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1258s">00:20:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It all connects. And so as you meditate on that, think, think about that, the ramifications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1265s">00:21:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the church being the temple. Okay. And let that be a moment of just this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1271s">00:21:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">explosion of self-evaluation, evaluation, even over our church and application right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1275s">00:21:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">away. Like if we truly believe we're the church, I mean, sorry, we're the temple. The church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1279s">00:21:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is a temple of God, the primary place in which God manifests his presence. What sort of place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1287s">00:21:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">should we be? You know, that's what Paul's getting at. Be who you are. You are the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1295s">00:21:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he gives this warning. Number four, which is verse 17. If any man destroys the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1304s">00:21:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">temple, God will destroy him. Now he is speaking metaphorically and stuff like that, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1313s">00:21:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reality is we do do stuff to destroy the temple, destroy the church. Aside from what we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1321s">00:22:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">been talking about the whole time, which is causing division, what are the more specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1328s">00:22:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and tangible ways do we harm our local body, our church? I think I might have asked this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1340s">00:22:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">before on a discussion question. Let's just talk about it a little bit. Okay. He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1345s">00:22:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I give you this warning. If any man destroys the church, think about this. How do we harm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1356s">00:22:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the church and the people in the church? Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1371s">00:22:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1392s">00:23:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Thank you. So he said, we've been talking about a lot of it before. It's all kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1397s">00:23:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rooted in your envy and strife and stuff like that. And then it's kind of breeds all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1401s">00:23:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">other stuff we do. But I just wanted to, again, for the sake of following his trail of thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1406s">00:23:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, if any man destroys the temple, you know, and essentially he's like rebuking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1411s">00:23:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">them. It's like, you're destroying the temple. But what sort of things do we do in our modern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1417s">00:23:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">day, perhaps just identifying some of those things that we harm the church? Gossip. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1432s">00:23:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Gossip and strife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1451s">00:24:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

That's really good. You know, for me, I think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1485s">00:24:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the Hebrews passage that do not neglect, you know, gathering together. And there's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1491s">00:24:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of just kind of neglecting the church. And I remember, you know, being told many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1497s">00:24:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">many times that, you know, we don't, there's nothing that just stays the same.

It's decaying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1510s">00:25:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that kind of stuff. Great. Other things? Becoming lukewarm. Pride. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1528s">00:25:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Compromising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1532s">00:25:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot, you know, if you think about each letter that Apostle Paul writes, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1536s">00:25:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he addresses some of these issues.

Remember that whole analogy of the building to me, it's like, yeah, it is a building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1566s">00:26:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know.

Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1574s">00:26:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">[inaudible]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1585s">00:26:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Great questions.

So that's kind of what we're, um, thank you for asking the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1593s">00:26:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Good segue. Okay. We're going to move forward. And Rachel asked a really good question. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1597s">00:26:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about this stuff and I just asked, like, just throw out any examples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1602s">00:26:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that we do to destroy the church. But how are we defining destroy? That's a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1607s">00:26:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">question. Okay. Now, in order to answer this question, this is another point at which we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1613s">00:26:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of have to understand the term destroy. Right? And this is where it's kind of good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1619s">00:26:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">again to go to websites like blueletterbible.com, biblestudytools.com also gives you Greek and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1624s">00:27:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like that. Again, I want to give you a warning. What will happen is it'll give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1629s">00:27:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you a word.

It'll give you like a gloss of definitions and the gloss of definitions for the term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1638s">00:27:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">destroy includes everything from ruin, corrupt, injure or hurt. Okay. Now, the danger we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1645s">00:27:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have is, Oh, I'll pick one that I think kind of fits, you know, but you have to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1652s">00:27:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">put it in context. So this is why I asked you a question. Do you think God will destroy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1657s">00:27:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a Christian? Because there's a sense in which, so there's the church that's being metaphorically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1667s">00:27:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">spoken of as a temple. And then there's a guy who ends up either one of those glosses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1673s">00:27:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ruining, destroying, hurting, injuring the church. But in like manner, God is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1679s">00:27:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do the same thing to him. What do you think about that? So context sometimes will help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1686s">00:28:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of put parameters as to what that term might mean. Any thoughts? Okay. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1706s">00:28:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in thinking about this, I'm going to do this. I'll leave it to you to work out your faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1715s">00:28:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with fear and trembling and study that a little bit. What does God mean when he says I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1720s">00:28:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">destroy him? What does it mean that we destroy the temple? Obviously it has a negative connotation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1725s">00:28:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We do a lot of stuff that has negative impact influence on the church, right? And we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1730s">00:28:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to be wary of it. I'm going to move on to this next point. Why? Why does God make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1737s">00:28:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">threat? I asked, is this a legitimate threat? Of course it is. God says in the scriptures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1742s">00:29:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it just says flat out, if you destroy the temple, God will destroy him. Right? Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1748s">00:29:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a legitimate threat? Yes, I do believe it is a legitimate threat. Not a threat, a warning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1754s">00:29:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's not just an empty threat. It's going to happen. If an individual is hurting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1759s">00:29:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that precious thing for which he sent his son, that precious thing to which he has raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1764s">00:29:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his under shepherds and that precious things to which he has given structure and he's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1768s">00:29:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to ensure its success.

He's giving fair warning. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105584#t=1780s">00:29:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in this passage, what does he say?
