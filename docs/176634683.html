where they stand before God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=160s">00:02:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all the religious things that they're

that somehow, you know, our primary concern is what can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=176s">00:02:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I do to

come before God, the primary thing that God's calling you to do is repent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=184s">00:03:04.520</a></span> | <span

meaningless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=192s">00:03:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that God calls Isaiah to do is to call them out in their sins, to declare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=196s">00:03:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to them their

problem that he's telling Isaiah to call out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=206s">00:03:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, they didn't know where they stood before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=210s">00:03:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He said they were delighting to know his ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=214s">00:03:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the surface, it seems like they were right

superficial religiousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=222s">00:03:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, God calls Isaiah to tell them about their sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=227s">00:03:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it mean they forsook judgment of God in verse 2?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=233s">00:03:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you understand that when he said they, you know, they were delighting in the knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=237s">00:03:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, right, and then they were forsaking the judgment of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=242s">00:04:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=245s">00:04:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you understand that when you read that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=247s">00:04:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Kind of like universal, like God loves everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=256s">00:04:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not just like, we're just human people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=260s">00:04:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So they didn't understand that God was angry with them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=263s">00:04:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Or that like God, why would that punish them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=267s">00:04:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't understand the judgment of God.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=285s">00:04:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So when all of these things are happening, it has nothing to do with them because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176634683#t=287s">00:04:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">don't recognize the judgment of God.</span></div><div
