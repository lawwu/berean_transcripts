be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=402s">00:06:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">interested?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=403s">00:06:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we actually did even contact him, it was just for the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span

a year, almost two years, and just seamlessly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=426s">00:07:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he fit into our

href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=442s">00:07:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like a prodigal son, instead of coming back, he went to Korea for five years to travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=447s">00:07:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He traveled all over the world, you know, for

there's areas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=481s">00:08:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the church that he's been helping out in that we

together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=505s">00:08:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I've shared this so many times, but I remember it's very specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=511s">00:08:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just this one time, but that event kind of solidified for me, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=517s">00:08:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that God

years ago on Thanksgiving, at Thanksgiving, I think it was about five years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=525s">00:08:45.460</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=532s">00:08:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I had to leave our family Thanksgiving dinner and I came to church and I opened the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=536s">00:08:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">door and found our church flooded, about three inches of water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=540s">00:09:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, obviously I was really distraught because if we don't have those rooms, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=544s">00:09:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">know, our children would have nowhere to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=546s">00:09:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They would have to have their Sunday school in the parking

of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=552s">00:09:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was just with the door open, I tried to drain the water as much as possible, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=556s">00:09:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no

Thanksgiving dinner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=561s">00:09:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I called them, they would have to leave

href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=571s">00:09:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we stayed all night together till five or six in the morning, just draining the water,</span></div><div

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=580s">00:09:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I was there till about seven in the morning and there was still a lot to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=585s">00:09:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to prepare and dry it out for the children to come the next day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=588s">00:09:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But he was worried about me that, you know, he knew that I had to preach the next day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=592s">00:09:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said, "You know, you need to go home and get some sleep and get ready for Sunday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=596s">00:09:56.220</a></span> | <span

who were available, came, and he finished the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=601s">00:10:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so by the time we came on Sunday, we had it ready enough so that we can use it that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=605s">00:10:05.780</a></span> | <span

home just with a huge sigh of relief because Pastor Mark just showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=612s">00:10:12.540</a></span> | <span

because that's how he's been all these years with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=617s">00:10:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">me, you know,

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/366126368#t=629s">00:10:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Mark has been my right-hand man.</span></div><div class="c"><span
