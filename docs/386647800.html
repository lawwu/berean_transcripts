section of scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=161s">00:02:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">As a matter of fact, there are lots of people who will note that this portion of scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=167s">00:02:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in Ephesians

incredible way, just in these short verses, 11 verses or so, it summarizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=178s">00:02:58.340</a></span> | <span

summarizes all the blessings we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=183s">00:03:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It summarizes the heavenly things that we can look forward to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=186s">00:03:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it just gives to us so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=189s">00:03:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the kind of introductory remark I would like to say is that verse three through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=192s">00:03:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">14 is like a

who is just giving this eloquent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=199s">00:03:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">lyrical, almost like genius kind of expression of intense emotion, intense thought, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=205s">00:03:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a rhapsody, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=207s">00:03:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what Apostle Paul is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=210s">00:03:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He is enthusiastically expressing how we ought to bless God because God has blessed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=216s">00:03:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">us in such incredible fashion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=220s">00:03:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the incredible thing about all this is that although in the English language, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=226s">00:03:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's translated, it's broken up into about three sentences, this long, long paragraph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=231s">00:03:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">starting from verse three all the way to verse 14 is actually one incredible run-on sentence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=237s">00:03:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Greek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=239s">00:03:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">There is this like overflowing excitement in Apostle Paul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=244s">00:04:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people actually look at this and they'll say, "This is one of the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=247s">00:04:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">lyrically and literally like genius pieces because it almost feels like it can be sung."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=256s">00:04:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people say there's this rhythm and there is this movement to this section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=260s">00:04:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I'm highlighting this to you is because then what you see in Apostle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=265s">00:04:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul is somebody who is just so enamored with the truth of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=271s">00:04:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you've ever seen somebody who really gets it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=274s">00:04:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've ever interacted with somebody who really truly understands, what you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=279s">00:04:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is that that person has looked at this precious truth, this precious faith that we have in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=285s">00:04:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple angles so that he can summarize incredible truths into short, condensed ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=291s">00:04:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you see that, you realize like this person understands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=294s">00:04:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's more, he can extrapolate and say, "Let me give you examples."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=297s">00:04:57.660</a></span> | <span

know, in a kind of idiomatic way is, "He knows it in and out."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=305s">00:05:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what you feel when Apostle Paul is walking through with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=308s">00:05:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at the way God has blessed us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=310s">00:05:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Boom, boom, boom,

great ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=315s">00:05:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we say this, I ask you this question, "Do you feel Apostle Paul exhorting us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=321s">00:05:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=322s">00:05:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a command in here?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=324s">00:05:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's really interesting, the answer is yes and no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=328s">00:05:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The no is because there is no command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=330s">00:05:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">There is actually no verb in verse 3, which is kind of weird, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=334s">00:05:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more, what Apostle Paul is doing is he is just, in a weird way to say, is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=339s">00:05:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">off, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=340s">00:05:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going off about how amazing God is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=344s">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is a thrust there because when you look at verse 3, he says, "Blessed be God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=351s">00:05:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's not a command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=352s">00:05:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not an imperative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=354s">00:05:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What it is is an adjective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=356s">00:05:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But he puts it right at the beginning of that long, long paragraph in an emphatic way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/386647800#t=361s">00:06:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">tell us this is what we need to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
