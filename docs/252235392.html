actually spent only four of the days visiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=185s">00:03:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">four different

day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=193s">00:03:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, I just have to say the driving in India is just absolute madness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=201s">00:03:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no organization.</span></div><div

go over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=212s">00:03:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to the incoming traffic all the time to try to pass the

traffic until the very last minute and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=220s">00:03:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they would switch over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=221s">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I felt like I was going to die like all the time, but it was pretty exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=225s">00:03:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess that was fun.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=253s">00:04:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like everyone could hear us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=268s">00:04:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to see what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span

them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=296s">00:04:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We were giving them glasses, eyedrops, and

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=320s">00:05:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They would accept it and then one day proclaim God as their Lord and

opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/252235392#t=1099s">00:18:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And Apostle Paul talks about that in 1 Corinthians 16, 9,
