So if you notice that the previous passage, it ended with sort of a reminder of Israel's sin and then if you look at verse 25 and 28 through 28 in chapter 43, it was a call to repentance. So the theme that we begin in chapter 44 is connected to that, where God is still calling out and if you remember at the very end, again there's a prophecy of God's faithfulness and so chapter 44 begins by reminding us of what Israel, how Israel means, like what Israel means to the Lord.</p><p>So the first question was that why is Israel told not to fear? Right? Whoops. What happened? Okay, so it's only the first one. Alright, there you go. Okay, you can just jot it down and then I'll talk after you guys jot it down. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.</p><p>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright, so the first question was the theme again in the first three verses where God is reminding the nation of Israel and kind of encouraging them not to fear and the reason why the again the reason why he says not to fear is main theme in the first three verses is that God has not abandoned them.</p><p>Right? Remember we talked about that last week where there's a there's a pronouncement of judgment and then he says but I have not forgotten you and so it's going back and forth. So last week we talked about how God reminds them in verse 21 how he brought judgment upon them but they didn't see this from the Lord and they didn't turn to him and give sacrifices.</p><p>You know and yet despite that it ends with God pleading with them to come return to them. Right? So despite their sins despite their failures despite the lack of genuine sacrifice that they're bringing to God God says I have not abandoned you and the reason why he gives several reasons here like God has God has formed you from your mother's womb God has chosen you God will bless you and your descendants you are the Lord's that so let's look at one by one when he says God has formed you from the womb you hear this quite often whenever God is trying to encourage or to remind the nation that he is with them that that phrase is like I've known you or God formed me from my mother's womb what what is the imagery and what is the encouragement that he's giving when he says that because you see you see that over and over when whenever either David is saying that of himself how God knew me he knew my inner parts even from my mother's womb or God is telling Israel or or a particular person right so those of you who live in more sensitive than other people right so what kind of encouragement do you find like in what context would that be an encouragement like I knew you from your mother's womb there's a kind of an intimacy that this is not just somebody that you met randomly right this is in a sense it's kind of like family right like I've known you since you're like I say that like if if I've known somebody for a long time and there's a deep affection I would say yeah I've known you since you were a little kid you know what I mean but it goes even deeper than that right even before you knew yourself you mean before you your parents may have known you I knew you right so why why is that an encouragement not to fear that's how much you mean to me right that's what God is saying to Israel you don't have to fear because you're not just like anybody else right that's how much you mean to me it's like I have chosen you right you didn't choose me I chose you so whatever whatever danger is around you like I chose you so in other words I'm gonna protect you like I will bless you and your descent is not only not only is it just a temporary blessing but this blessing is gonna be upon you and for descendants to come right it's not just a I'm not just gonna deliver you from a temporary danger but but I my blessing is upon you and your descendants right and then verse 5 where he says the one will say I am the Lord's another will call on the name of Jacob another will write on his hand the Lord's in other words you belong to me and that's kind of like the summary of everything that he's saying here right so you don't need to fear because my name is on you right again same thing with us as Christians the reason why we don't fear why we don't you know we don't teeter-totter back and forth just like he says if he is for us who can be against us and that's basically what he's saying to the nation of Israel no matter what happens right no matter again he's gonna be talking about how site he's gonna establish King Cyrus to to deliver them and then he's gonna revert back in history remember I talked about last week like Isaiah is prophesying even before the captivity it may have happened during his lifetime but how long of a time passes from the moment that Isaiah is prophesying this and Cyrus actually comes into power the Persians come into power I mentioned it in passing last week more 150 to possibly 200 years right 150 to possibly 200 years where he's prophesying so he's looking way in the future you can see why some people like if you don't believe in miracles and prophecies like oh Isaiah could not have written this right Isaiah may have written written portions of it but that portion where his his specific name right and what he was going to do he prophesied 200 years before it happens so either this is a miracle of God right God is actually speaking through him and prophesying or sorry or I could not have written this right because how can you promise how can you actually mention somebody's name in 200 years it comes true so basically he prophesied that King Cyrus is gonna come he's gonna be his agent to deliver them and then he goes into description of the Babylonians and what they're gonna come and do right so he's kind of telling them telling them again in the future these things may not have even happened yet but when they come do not fear right what evidences are given in the next verses six seven and eight right that he is the king once so the first section he begins by saying you don't need to fear because I knew you in the mother's womb I chose you I will bless your nations my name is a for your mind right and then the second part of it he says well who are you well I'm your king right I'm the one I'm the king because I redeemed you right you belong to me again same thing with us you know the Bible describes our salvation as moving kingdoms right we've been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to kingdom of his son right so he says I'm your king because I redeemed you I'm your king in verse 7 because what I have said has come true who is like me let him proclaim it let him declare and said it before me since I appointed an ancient people let them declare what is to come and what will happen so again what is the encouragement here when he says what I declare it comes true how would you be encouraged if you heard that right every promise he makes will come true that's basically what he's saying like he's not giving empty promises what other king what other idol can tell you these things and then see it comes true right test to see so he's the first and the last again that title is given to Christ is given to God and it's in again many different passages throughout the scripture so what does it mean to be first and last what's another way that Paul says it first and last everything is created by him and for him right that he is sovereign over the past present and future right all right so this is a third question again I'm just gonna leave these for your discussion later but what's the difference between someone who was walking in the spirit because the reason why I ask this is because one of the promises he makes is that upon the descendants I was blessed you by pouring my spirit upon you right so what is the difference between walking in the spirit versus someone who's walking in the flesh what tangible things do you see that are different in your life okay so again I'll leave that for your discussion later all right so what's the main point of verses 9 through 20 he gives a long illustration about these idols so I want you to take a minute okay take a few minutes I'm sure you'll have more time later on in your small group to discuss it but in your small group just take a few minutes and I think there's there are probably more than one lesson here it's not it's kind of like a parable so parables don't have a like a sharp point like when Jesus tells a parable he kind of sums it up and then you know what his point is right but in this parable nobody's summing it up it just kind of presented to you and so you may gain different insights right you can't make up stuff but within the story that he tells what's the point that that he's trying to make about the idols and about Israel okay so take a few minutes okay don't do your homework now okay take a few minutes to discuss with your group what what is he saying versus 9 through 20 what is he teaching                                                                                                     Right.</p><p>It seems kind of, if you put some thought into it, you broke it, you're using it for fire, you're cooking off of it, and then with the little piece left over, you're worshipping it. Right? Again, to illustrate in more detail, like the foolishness. I mean, it's just, obviously the illustration is like many other illustrations, but the fact that he went through so much, you know, took so much time to illustrate the details of it, and you kind of, like, God is revealing to them just how foolish this is.</p><p>If you were to just take a step back and look at it, right? Just for the sake of time, in other words, idols are made by man and not man by idols. Right? You made this. Right? God gave you a tree for you to use to cook and whatever, and then you turn it around and you make what God has made, and then make idols out of it.</p><p>Right? These are, again, these are just some observations that I've made. A lot of time and effort into making something that does nothing. And God gave wood to be used for man and not to worship it. Right? Again, these are all same points, just said a different way. I don't know about you, but, you know, if you study through Isaiah, and you see God pleading with Israel over and over and over and over again, and we're talking about, even though Isaiah is talking about a short period of history, we're talking about 200 years of history.</p><p>The over 1,000 years of Israel's history was the same thing. Right? In fact, if you take it even further out, mankind's history, thousands and thousands of years of history is the same thing, where God disciplines, and then He comes and He pleads with them for forgiveness, and then God relents, and then as soon as they're doing okay, they forget, and they become proud, and they forget God over and over, and God is pleading.</p><p>And then I look at, like, how many times do you need to give this instruction to these people before they get it? And how many times do you do this, and then they forget it, before you say, "That's enough." You know what I mean? At some point, you would think God would just, His patience would be exhausted, and it's like, "I can't take this anymore." You know?</p><p>And the fact that He's taking this kind of time to go to this kind of detail, to show them, plead with them, another generation, the same thing over and over, it's just kind of, to me, don't you get frustrated when you read this stuff? Even though we say, "Wow, God is so merciful and faithful, because we're these people." But if you were to put yourself in God's position, even just for a minute while you're reading this, I mean, it's frustrating.</p><p>Look at Israel's history over and over again, and yet, again, God is patient because He, through all of this, what is He trying to teach? You have no hope in yourself. Right? That's really the conclusion that we should come to. You have no hope. Right? And that's why when Christ comes as a Redeemer, He is our only hope.</p><p>And again, as we've been talking about in Romans, why it can only be by His promise and by His calling. Right? If you look at Israel's history, this is not just about Israel, this is us. Right? Again, this is another application of Christ, I think. No, no, no. Here's another question.</p><p>Where He says, in verse 18, "They know not, nor do they discern, for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see, and their hearts so that they cannot understand." So the question was, if God shut their eyes and hardened their hearts, how can He keep saying it's their fault?</p><p>Right? That was the question. How did you guys answer that? How do you reconcile that when somebody asks you that question? Let me start calling names. Would that be easier? Yes? Isaac? James Hong was tapping him the whole time. Alright, okay. I didn't mean to put you on the spot.</p><p>I thought you had something to say, and that's why he was trying to push you over the edge. So I dragged you. No, no, no. Don't feel pressure. Unless you want to. It sounded like you guys had a discussion. It's interesting, especially when you look at the way God deals with Pharaoh.</p><p>God deals with Pharaoh, and He says in three separate times about Pharaoh hardening his heart. He says it in the active, He says it in the middle, and He says it in the passive. Meaning that, I'll just put that up here. Not all from Exodus, but basically in Exodus 4.21, it says the same thing that He says here, that God hardened Pharaoh's heart.</p><p>And then in Exodus 8.15, He says God allowed Pharaoh's heart to be hardened. And I forgot to put the other one, where the other one says, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Right? So you look at the way God deals with them, it's like all three is mentioned. But in the end, I think the summary in Romans 1.18, is a summary of mankind.</p><p>Because they rather have darkness than light, so God gave them over. So He allowed their hearts to be hardened. Does God ever take a man who is repentant and righteous, and He hardens his heart just to condemn him? Do you ever see that in the Bible? Never. Right? When He says He hardens their heart, He's usually talking about a sinner who refuses to repent.</p><p>And He's kind of releasing them to where they're already headed. Right? And the Bible makes it very clear. Now, it's hard for us to, again, understand how does God's sovereign work, with man's ability to choose for himself. Like, we don't know exactly how that works. But clearly the scripture says that God is not the originator of evil.</p><p>Right? God does not take something good and He makes it bad. Right? So, when we understand this in the context of rest of scripture, and then we see it in the context of the way He deals with Pharaoh, right? There is an active part that what God plays, because He's sovereign.</p><p>There is a part where He's just kind of releasing and letting it happen. And then there's a part where the recipient is actively hardening these hearts. And all three are mentioned about the same Pharaoh. And it's another discussion question. Okay, so, again, in the context of God reaffirming to the nation of Israel, right?</p><p>Describing in detail all the work of God that we are to sing and worship Him. So, verse 21 to 28, the people of God break out into songs. How does each one of these works of God give you confidence to trust and worship Him? So, all of these things in response to His promises and the things that He's doing.</p><p>So, God calls Israel to remember who He is to them in contrast to what idols are that was stated in the previous passage. So, again, the long illustration that we saw in verse 19 to 20. So, now in 21 through 28, in contrast to these worthless idols, who is God, right?</p><p>Now, you have a tendency to go to these worthless things that is made to cook fire and to keep warm. In contrast to that, who am I, right? So, He made Israel His servants, verse 21. He's blotted out their transgressions, verse 22. And ultimately, because of that, He redeemed them.</p><p>So, again, if you read verse 9 through 20, and then 21 to 28, like all in one sitting, you can clearly see the contrast that He's making. These aren't two separate statements. This is one statement that He's making, and it was meant to kind of be seen side by side.</p><p>This is what you are tempted with, and this is who I am. So, it's foolish. Worshipping idols is foolish as it is, right? Even if you're not a worshipper of Yahweh, even if you never knew God, the fact that you would even depend on the idol, it's foolish. You make these little items that you can cook, all it is is wood.</p><p>But when you contrast that to Yahweh, you contrast that to who God is and what He has done for them, then it takes the foolishness to a whole new level. So, it's just like, again, as Christians, it's one thing to live in sin when you didn't know God, but another thing to live in sin in contrast to seeing the glory of God.</p><p>And that's why the Bible says the second state is worse than the first. Because now the sin has even become worse, because before you may have done it in ignorance, and it's still foolish to seek after things that are temporary, it means nothing. But in light of what you have in Christ, and yet you still choose the world, the foolishness of that, right?</p><p>So, again, when you read verse 9 through 28 put together, which was, I think, meant to be read together, again, the foolishness of worshipping idols is even that much more hard to understand. Again, He introduces to us, again, the King Cyrus, right? He was a pagan king over Persia, and we talked about that already.</p><p>This happened almost about 200 years after Isaiah prophesied. So, again, just as a review, his prophecy begins during the period of Assyrians, and he prophesies that the Babylonians are going to come, right? And then after the Babylonians, the Persians come, and they're going to take over. So, he's talking about three kingdoms that's going to come, and they're going to conquer, and God's using each one of them for what purpose?</p><p>What is the central purpose of, according to Isaiah, of the Assyrian kingdom, of the Babylonian kingdom, and of the Persian kingdom? His focal point is Israel, right? According to Isaiah. I mean, imagine hearing that at that time. What is, you know, what's a tiny little country that no one will be offended if I mentioned it today?</p><p>I mean, just imagine. Imagine a country that you would never think of. They're not wealthy. They don't have any political power. It's not a country that would have any kind of say in the UN. You know what I mean? Like, just some obscure little place. And to say that US, Russia, China are all being played out for that little country.</p><p>Right? I mean, think how ridiculous that may have sounded at that time. That's exactly what Isaiah is saying. Isaiah is a prophet from a tiny little nation that's being conquered and is clinging to Egypt, clinging to… And little Philistines are coming and kicking their butt. And then Isaiah is saying, "Our sovereign God is wielding the Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus and the Assyrians, and these guys are nothing.</p><p>God is wielding them for His glory, and ultimately He's going to bring a descendant." So, imagine hearing that at that time. It's like, "Are you kidding me?" Right? You would think that something great is happening in Assyria. Something great is happening in Babylon or Persia. Only in retrospect, we look back at it now, and we see Christ, and because of what Christ has done, we look at who made a bigger impact in human history.</p><p>Cyrus? Assyria? Babylonians? Nobody compares to what happened when Christ came. Right? In retrospect, 2,000 years later, we look at it now, all those kingdoms, like what Isaiah is saying, actually makes sense now. Right? Can you imagine at that time if you heard that? A tiny little nation that was a speck, it meant nothing to say, "All of this has happened because of this country." Right?</p><p>But we have the benefit of looking back at that and say, "Wow!" Like, what Isaiah said actually happened. Right? Who would ever even possibly imagine? You would be saying that the earth is going to turn the other direction for a while. You know, it would be that crazy. Right?</p><p>What an arrogant thing to say. Unless it was real. Which obviously now we have a retrospect, we can look at that and say, "It's real." Right? This is why the secular people have such a hard time with Isaiah, because how could Isaiah possibly have known this? Right? How could Isaiah even know?</p><p>They have a hard time even saying, "How could he have known this guy, the king of Persia, was going to be Cyrus, and that he was going to send Israel back to rebuild the temple and all that stuff?" How could he have possibly known that? Right? But it's just crazy when you really think about it, like when this was written, and then now we're looking back, and this actually happened.</p><p>Right? Just like he said. Cyrus was the pagan king over Persia, and yet God calls him the "anointed one." Right? Was he a worshipper of Yahweh? He was not. He was a pagan king. And yet God said he anointed. Even this pagan king is under his rule. Right? God uses Cyrus as his shepherd, because the shepherds of Israel were not leading or feeding.</p><p>Right? Leading his people, but only taking advantage of them. God is sovereign over history, therefore God is sovereign over those who have any authority. Again, Romans 13.1. Right? Perfect example of that. Again, if you were a Jew, or early Christian, and then when he heard from Paul, and he says, "Submit yourself to the authority, all authority," because all authority is established by who?</p><p>By God. So if you were a Christian or a Jew at that particular time, to think like, "Wow, Caesar is under God's control?" It would be hard to believe. Right? Hard to even fathom. Really? Like God is really sovereignly in control? But when you look at what happens in the prophecies of Isaiah, that's exactly what happens.</p><p>Right? This is why, you know, when he says, "God makes promises, and he does not change." Right? You can bank on his promise. And there's illustration after illustration throughout Scripture, throughout church history, throughout human history, where God, we can clearly see. Right? We're the ones short-sighted, because if I can't, if it doesn't make sense in my head, right?</p><p>Like, I can't possibly see this happening. Even the way we pray, if you think about it, we tend to pray for things that we think are possible. Right? We kind of pray for miracles just kind of on the side. Right? No? Yeah. I remember somebody pointed that out to me years ago, when I went to China for the first time.</p><p>This lady was like a prayer warrior, and she went into, she was planning to go into China. And this is when China was completely closed. And she would pray, she probably fasted like maybe once every three or four days. Like, just for breakfast time. So, one of the most diligent prayer warriors that I've ever met, and one of the things that she said to me that really stuck with me ever since, was as I was praying with her, and then after I prayed, she said, "Peter, you know, you're always praying defensively.</p><p>Right? You're always praying for protection, you're praying for health, you're praying for all this stuff, but, you know, pray in faith. Right? Pray knowing who you're praying to. Right? This is a, the God that you're praying to is God. And so, you're, even in the way that you pray, and what you pray kind of shows what you believe about God." And I remember her saying that, like, "Yeah, it's like so true.</p><p>This lady is like a prayer warrior. She knows what she's talking about." That's probably one of the most significant things that I learned about prayer through somebody. But again, like, we have a tendency to be short-sighted. So, when you see, you know, often times when you study the Bible, and you see things like this, like, God's seeing from this perspective.</p><p>And He's trying to, that's why He keeps mentioning over and over, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because the God that they worship, the miracles that I perform with them, I'm that God. Right? I'm the one who delivered Israel. I'm the one who conquered the Syrians and the Babylonians." So, all of this to kind of show them who He is, so that we can have confidence in who He is.</p><p>Right? Not just in what we see. Right? All right. Verse 4 says, "God names him Cyrus again, that he would actually even equip you through, though you do not know me." Right? Remember, Jesus says that, you know, when the Pharisees, "Stop telling your disciples to praise you." And He said, "If they don't praise me, then these rocks will cry out." Right?</p><p>The God could use even, don't you, you can't see it? Um, I think prophesied. What? Isaiah. Here? Yeah, Isaiah prophesied. I forgot. Nothing below this line. You can see clearly up to here, right? Oh, it's because of the pulpit? So, how does God reveal Himself to Cyrus in verse 5 to 7?</p><p>God will show Himself to be sovereign over human history. In other words, He's going to reveal Himself through Cyrus, that He is Cyrus. He is sovereign. Right? So, you know how it mentions in verse 5? 5 and 7. Or is it 46? Oops. So, He says, "I am the Lord, and there is no other besides Me.</p><p>There is no God. I equip you, though you do not know Me, that My people may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside Me. I am the Lord, there is no other. I form light and create darkness. I make well-being and create calamity.</p><p>I am the Lord who does all things." So, again, part of this is in direct refute of the God of the Persians. They had two categories of gods. The gods of darkness and the god of light. And so, when He says that He's the God of calamity, good or bad, He's sovereign.</p><p>Right? So, again, in essence, He's revealing Himself to Israel and also to Cyrus, who the true God is. So, in other words, God is not only in control when you see the blessing and good things, and God seems to be answering prayer. Right? Just like Job. Even in his darkest moment, God had never lost control.</p><p>All of that was happening because God allowed it. Right? So, is there anything that happens in your life and my life that God has no control over? Right? No. God is absolutely sovereign. Right? Sometimes God may be allowing it to happen, but God is absolutely sovereign. So, that's the part why we get anxious.</p><p>Right? We get anxious over things because things are out of our control. We are hoping and planning certain things, and we want certain things to happen, the results aren't happening the way we want, whatever it may be, and we get anxious. So, anxiousness comes when we feel like things that I have control over are slipping out of my hands.</p><p>But this is a reminder that God is in absolute control. That's why He says, "Be anxious for nothing," right? But to pray, right? With thanksgiving. "At your request, be made known to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses human understanding, will guard your hearts and mind in Christ Jesus." Right?</p><p>So, that's basically what it's saying. He is sovereign over all. Good and a bad. Right? A person or a nation resisting God is like a pot contending with the potter. Right? In other words, God is in the context of accomplishing His work. Right? He may be in the context of burning it down.</p><p>Right? Maybe the pot's not formed correctly. Maybe the handle is in the wrong place. Maybe the reason why all this stuff is happening, a lot of times, is just to break us down. Because until we're broken, we can't be molded. Right? But whatever it is, to come before God to complain for anything, is like complaining to the potter and saying, "Hey, hey, hey.</p><p>You don't know what you're doing." Right? So that's how He describes it. Right? Unbelief, basically, is contending with God and saying, "No, you're not making the pot correctly." I think the greatest time of sanctification always is when you're hurt. Right? When you're broken. And God really humbles you. Humbles your pride, any kind of confidence that you had in the past, whatever it is, security that you're holding on to, God kind of yanks that out of your hand.</p><p>And then you're kind of like broken, you're hurt, maybe you're angry, you're in despair, maybe even unbelief, you know. And God brings you to that point because He's trying to mold you into something. Like clay that's hard can't be molded. And it tends to be like when God is really working to sanctify you, reaching into a place maybe that you've hidden for so long, that usually when God wants to go in there and do something, it hurts.</p><p>Right? The deeper it is, the more it's going to hurt. But He said God does that to build, ultimately, His people, His children. And He says, "Ask of Me the things to come concerning My children and the works of My hands." So we are not able to see the big picture because we only know what is.</p><p>Right? We only see what is. That is why He says to come and ask of Me, to search Me. That's why I think it's always good to be connected with saints that have gone before us. Right? A lot of times hearing the struggles and the trials of people who've gone the previous generation.</p><p>You know, again, I think especially in the Western generation, like because we value youth, and we have a tendency that all movement happens with the youth. When's the last time you saw a 60-year-old, you know, in the head of some kind of movement? You know? Not in the Western culture, because the Western culture usually wants new innovations.</p><p>Anything new, young, vibrant. But I think that what we miss from that is the wisdom that comes from people who've lived a long period of time. You know? There's a lot of things to gain from the previous generation. Right? Because we're so short-sighted. And being young, we're even more short-sighted because we don't see the bigger picture.</p><p>Right? So, the danger that I caution all of us, all of you, is that because you're surrounded by even younger people. I mean, you're young, but you're surrounded by even younger people. And so you start having a mentality, "I'm an old man at the age of 30." Right? Or age of 35.</p><p>Right? And so when you start having that kind of mentality, where you become the teacher too early, you stop learning. Right? You stop asking. Right? You put on that hat. And I think that's why becoming a pastor, becoming a leader, it actually is hurtful. Because it's hard to learn.</p><p>Because you're always putting on that hat to teach people. Right? Again, this is kind of sidetracked, but I think there's a danger. Like, because he keeps saying, "Ask of me." Right? So, I think the wisdom would cause ourselves to see how short-sighted we are, and constantly seeing the bigger picture.</p><p>And obviously, we go to God, but there's people who have gone before us. Right? So, I love talking to older pastors who've been in ministry longer, you know, and the things that they say, the observations that they had. And because it helps me to see my current situation a lot better.</p><p>Right? So, again, in the larger scale of things, you see what God is doing. Like, why is God doing this in your life? Because there's nothing new under the sun. Everything that you've been feeling, every conflict and every struggle that you have, somebody has struggled with it before. Some generation was wrestling with that same thing before.</p><p>Right? And yet, God is sovereign. And what effect will Israel's deliverance have among the Gentiles? So, here, you know, it talks about how Israel is delivered. Right? The nations that Israel had to submit to will come and bow down to Israel. So, in other words, Israel's deliverance means deliverance for who?</p><p>Oops. Israel's deliverance means deliverance for who? To the nations. Right? So, you can read all of this and say, "Oh, God only cares about Israel." Right? It was never just about Israel. He said, "His plan is that through Israel, He's going to bless the nations." Right? That was His intention always.</p><p>Again, because we're short-sighted, so we only see, like, "Oh, God loves Israel. God only chose Israel." But when you look at the larger picture, like what God is doing in history, that He's the beginning and the end, Alpha and Omega. It's always been about mankind. He just happens to be, like, the plan that He's going to carry this out is through the nation of Israel.</p><p>Right? God not only created the world, He said everyone in it, He created. He did nothing in secret. Verse 18 and 19. Okay. Alright. So, you know, again, as we wrap up, one of the things that I think clear theme that keeps coming up over and over again is God's big picture.</p><p>Why is He pursuing Israel to this extent? Right? It's not just about Israel. He's pursuing mankind. He's pursuing us. Right? His patience with Israel is because He's being patient with us. Because the Messiah is coming through that line. Salvation is going to come through that line. Right? So all of this is, again, is God patient towards sinners to save us.</p><p>Alright. So if you guys can take some time with your small group. Oh, sorry. Chapter 46, 8, 9, and 10. So it's three verses. It's a bit longer than normal. Okay. Chapter 46, 8, 9, and 10. Okay.</p></div></body></html>
