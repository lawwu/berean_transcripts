neglect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=246s">00:04:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Friday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=312s">00:05:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">night, teenagers gathered together in LA and we would

prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=322s">00:05:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They had a separate prayer school where all through the

who was in furlough and he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=342s">00:05:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">waiting and being trained to be

the Word of God is not coupled with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=768s">00:12:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">humility and desperateness

all the more why, as a church, we emphasize the Word of God where we absolutely must be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the manner in which we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=816s">00:13:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pray says, "To bow our knees before Him, to

href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=854s">00:14:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And before I even jump in, I want to emphasize this because the Trinity is highlighted in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=859s">00:14:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this text in prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=860s">00:14:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The source of our prayer is God the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=863s">00:14:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The means of prayer is the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=866s">00:14:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the goal of prayer is Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=869s">00:14:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can clearly see the work of the Holy Spirit in the call to pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=874s">00:14:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now whenever you see all three persons of the Trinity that is engaged in something

the power that we receive because of the Holy Spirit, that that in and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=898s">00:14:58.160</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=915s">00:15:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Where God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son are actively working together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=921s">00:15:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to call us to this activity, which is to

as the source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=929s">00:15:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first thing that He says in verse 15 is,

is to recognize that that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=940s">00:15:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly where we come

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=945s">00:15:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole purpose of why salvation was given to us so that we may be restored back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=950s">00:15:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to why He created us in the first place.</span></div><div

trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=978s">00:16:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't discipled to be cats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=981s">00:16:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They were born as cats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=983s">00:16:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things that's interesting to me is the way they play and the way what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=989s">00:16:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting to watch is even though they never watched this, they didn't have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=995s">00:16:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like older cats to show them this is what they're supposed to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=998s">00:16:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Whenever they play, they play like they're catching a

their back legs and then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1008s">00:16:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">would jump up into the sky and then they would pounce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1012s">00:16:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, oh, that's if you're going to catch mice, that's exactly what you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1015s">00:16:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">need to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1016s">00:16:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1017s">00:16:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting that they never watched any other cats do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1020s">00:17:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They just did that instinctively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1024s">00:17:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have cat like reflexes because they're cats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1030s">00:17:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they're created that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1031s">00:17:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So their vision, their senses, their legs, their muscle distribution, all of that was</span></div><div

doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/664077908#t=1053s">00:17:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what they were created to do.</span></div><div
