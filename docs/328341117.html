So as we jump into this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=123s">00:02:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">passage, a really quick, quick review is necessary because the verse stands with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=128s">00:02:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"and." Starts with "and," sorry. Starts with "and." If you recall, this is only the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=135s">00:02:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">second half of the previous section. Now, in order to review, I want to start with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=140s">00:02:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 1 of chapter 3. And the idea there is the whole of this entire section from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=146s">00:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 1 to verse 17, it is talking about the applicational push. Everything we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=152s">00:02:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have learned in the past is pushing us here in chapter 3 to apply, to put into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=158s">00:02:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">practice, and therefore to actually change. The gospel that we believe is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=163s">00:02:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely transformative, and Apostle Paul is pushing us towards that. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=168s">00:02:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">way I'm gonna put it is he's pushing us towards maturity. First and foremost, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=173s">00:02:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pushing us towards maturity in thought. Okay? In thought. Why do I say that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=178s">00:02:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that passage in verses 1 through 4, chapter 3, verse 1 through 4, says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=183s">00:03:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Therefore, if you've been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=187s">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=193s">00:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and not on the things that are on earth." Right? And so the command is very clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=198s">00:03:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that it involves your mind, that you constantly place it on the things that are about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=203s">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, of Christ. If you recall, that's exactly what he's been doing since chapter 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=209s">00:03:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "I want you to have full knowledge, come to full wisdom, full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=215s">00:03:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding." He said, "I want you to understand who you have. You have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=220s">00:03:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">maker, you have the sustainer, you have all, all in all. And therefore, I want you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=226s">00:03:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to know you're complete. I want you to know that you've been circumcised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=229s">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritually. I want you to know you've been baptized. I want you to know what you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=234s">00:03:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in Jesus." That was chapters 1 through 3 pretty much, right? Or chapter 1 and 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=239s">00:03:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, Apostle Paul and the Lord desires us to have mature humility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=246s">00:04:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The blank there is humility. Now you could put in other words summarizing this idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=251s">00:04:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but the last portion that we studied, the command for us was to put away, to lay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=259s">00:04:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">aside and trash all the things that was ignoble. And he says, "Therefore consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=264s">00:04:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the members of your earthly body dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desires,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=270s">00:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and greed, which amounts to idolatry." So that was verses 5 through 9, telling us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=275s">00:04:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have to have a level of humility to look inside ourselves, be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=282s">00:04:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">introspective, and be able to identify those things that are evil. Those desires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=288s">00:04:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that are corrupt, those things that are greedy, and therefore, idolatrous. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=293s">00:04:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this is sometimes a major error that we have. A major error which is this. In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=299s">00:04:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of maturity, sometimes we think maturity comes by way of skill,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=304s">00:05:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">accomplishment. I've studied, I got my A, then I got to get a job, and da-da, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=310s">00:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">here, right? Skill has nothing to do necessarily with maturity. As a matter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=316s">00:05:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, I find it kind of humorous that in our generation, we make this mistake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=320s">00:05:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">quite often, especially in just sports, the arena of sports. You have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=326s">00:05:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">athlete, he's huge, it's surprising to me, a lot of you guys probably watch some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=330s">00:05:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">college football. Every time I watch college football, I'm like, "That guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=333s">00:05:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cannot be under 22. He looks like he's 30." I mean, the individuals are big, large, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=339s">00:05:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">strong, and all that kind of stuff, and some of them can do quite, I'm sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=343s">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">quite amazing stuff. And then, therefore, people go in and ask them like questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=347s">00:05:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about life. "Do you think da-da-da-da-da? Do you think we should vote for whoever and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=351s">00:05:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whoever?" It's like, "The guy's not a politician. He throws a basketball, right?" But we make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=357s">00:05:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this flawed, erred kind of assessment of what is maturity. Maybe because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=363s">00:06:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really well-known, or whatever it may be. Maturity oftentimes comes by our ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=368s">00:06:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to see and identify reality as is. To see that there are certain things within us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=375s">00:06:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that needs to be corrected. Now, the third one is going to be mature love, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=380s">00:06:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what we're tackling today. Mature love. That the character traits, such as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=387s">00:06:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">selfishness, and immorality, and greed, and all this kind of stuff, is immature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=392s">00:06:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're unloving. And what is mature is when I can actually trust you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=398s">00:06:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in your love for somebody else. If I tie the two together, the mature humility and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=404s">00:06:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">mature love, an individual who may be very skilled, knowledgeable, theologically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=409s">00:06:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">astute, and doctrinally sound, and all that kind of stuff, he may be all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=415s">00:06:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that, he may be all of that, but that does not mean I am willing to place people I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=419s">00:06:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">love in his hands. Right? Because he has to show his ability to garner that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=425s">00:07:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of trustworthiness through the maturity of his love. If he cared and loved books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=431s">00:07:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but cared nothing for people, I'm not gonna trust you with people. That's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=435s">00:07:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the way it goes. Right? Now, part of the reason why I've set all this up is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=440s">00:07:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because, again, the major push. We're gonna feel through these passages this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=446s">00:07:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge and exhortation for us to put on new thoughts, new attitudes, and new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=452s">00:07:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">behaviors. And that naturally is going to, therefore, then cause us to do both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=457s">00:07:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically. Both to put off the stuff that we've been already doing, and put on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=462s">00:07:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that God wants us to put on. And it also naturally humbles us. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=468s">00:07:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the obvious statement is, you're not as mature as you should be. Right? There's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=475s">00:07:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">much room to grow. There's so much more we should be striving for. Now, with that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=479s">00:07:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">said, let's jump into the passage and make observations specifically of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=483s">00:08:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">various passages. Okay? So as you take a look at this, let's read down here. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=490s">00:08:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then, again, I'm gonna try to blaze through some portions of this. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=496s">00:08:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see how far we can get. In this very first section, what we find is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=503s">00:08:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 10 through 11, this is what he says, "And I've put on the new self who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=508s">00:08:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the one who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=512s">00:08:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">created him. A renewal in which there is no distinction between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=516s">00:08:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=521s">00:08:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and free man, but Christ is all and in all." Okay? So what I'm gonna say is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=527s">00:08:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 10 and 11 belong together. And essentially, the command is very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=532s">00:08:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"Put on the new self." So what you should have done is highlighted, and I'm gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=537s">00:08:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight in purple, the command. I typically always highlight the commands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=542s">00:09:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because those are imperatives that you can meditate on and you can seek to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=546s">00:09:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and apply. How do I make sure I apply this? I don't want to miss it. But what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=551s">00:09:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">also very interesting is he says, "Put on this new self." And the way I'm gonna say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=556s">00:09:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that the reason why verse 10 and 11 belong together is because it's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=561s">00:09:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">introduction of what this new self is. Because as soon as we see this, we should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=566s">00:09:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be asking ourselves this question. And what is that question? That question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=570s">00:09:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">simply should be, "How is this new self described in verse 10 through 11?" Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=577s">00:09:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you'll find is that here, as you guys have maybe seen this before with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=583s">00:09:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the diagramming stuff, I blocked it off this way, and at least I indented it, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=588s">00:09:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just because I love grammar, but because it shows a flow of thought. All it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=592s">00:09:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is this pronoun "who" is describing this new self. Right? My artistic skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=599s">00:09:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are improving? That is an arrow. Okay. Alright. Who is describing the new self?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=605s">00:10:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more, this new self is clearly being renewed. And it also gives you this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=612s">00:10:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">idea here, this preposition "to," it also gives us a directional force. What are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=619s">00:10:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you being renewed to? Okay? And you're being renewed to the knowledge, or true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=623s">00:10:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge. Now, here it says, "According to the image of the one who created him." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=629s">00:10:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">all I'm gonna say really briefly is this is describing this whole process. You are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=636s">00:10:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being renewed to the true knowledge according to the image of the one. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=643s">00:10:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are progressively being renewed, you are progressively being changed and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=648s">00:10:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">transformed to the image of Christ. And if you think about it, the connection is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=653s">00:10:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's why you should let go of all the stuff that was before. The commands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=659s">00:10:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for us to put off immorality, impurity, and all that kind of stuff, and do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=663s">00:11:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">lie to each other. And it says, "Since you have put aside the old self,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=667s">00:11:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have already put on this new self in Christ, and you are being renewed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=672s">00:11:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to his image." Right? So the whole idea is your past life absolutely incompatible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=680s">00:11:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with the progress that God is doing in you. You've heard this many times, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=685s">00:11:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you are in a sanctifying process right now. Right? God's will is that there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=691s">00:11:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">active, step-by-step, progressive change in you. And all the things of the past is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=697s">00:11:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">incompatible with that plan of God. Now here, I want to make mention of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=704s">00:11:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">concept here, which is the true knowledge. Okay? This is the true knowledge, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=709s">00:11:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the image of the one. And so what I'd like to quickly make mention of is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=713s">00:11:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this. So if we're talking about this idea that you should be putting on this new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=720s">00:12:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">self, and there is this process of change, and you're supposed to be letting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=725s">00:12:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">go of bad, evil practices from before, whether it be lying and all that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=729s">00:12:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff, can we ask the question that if you are doing stuff that is inconsistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=734s">00:12:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with Jesus, if you are doing things that you know are of greed or of evil</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=740s">00:12:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thoughts, then can we say that your understanding of Jesus is off? You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=746s">00:12:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm asking? Here is your action on one hand, I see it, you lied. Here is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=752s">00:12:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">intent and the content of your mind. Can we assume that your mind and your heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=759s">00:12:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is off? And the answer is yes. Okay? What I mean by that is, listen, the truth that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=768s">00:12:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we believe absolutely matters. It is the foundation of our change. The things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=773s">00:12:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we believe about Jesus, His world, His will, all of these things matter because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=778s">00:12:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who He is, what He's done in the gospel, and His plans for you in the future, all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=783s">00:13:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">those things change your behavior. What you believe and what you see absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=789s">00:13:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">change your behavior. It does. If you are messing around, kicking a box, jumping on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=794s">00:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a box, and everyone thinks like, "Oh, you're having a grand old time," you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=797s">00:13:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">perfectly fine. There's nothing going on in your heart. You have no bad emotions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=800s">00:13:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're just happy. If I tell you, "Oh my goodness, my dog was in there," now all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=806s">00:13:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a sudden you're guilty, you're stopped, you automatically immediately stop. How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=810s">00:13:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you are thinking and what you find out will absolutely change how you behave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=816s">00:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, someone might think, "Hey, isn't that just like cognitive behavioral science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=821s">00:13:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and psychology?" Well, here's the idea. For us as believers, the content of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=828s">00:13:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">mind must be full on Christ. The truth and revelations that's changing you must</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=834s">00:13:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">be this full understanding, the true knowledge of Christ. That's what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=840s">00:14:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">radically changing you. Okay, so now let me kind of bring this together and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=845s">00:14:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">share a convicting point about this. If you guys notice, I made sure to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=851s">00:14:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight for you that sometimes we see certain actions, and then can we judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=856s">00:14:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the heart? Can we judge the mind? Can we judge what we're thinking? And my answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=861s">00:14:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to you was yes. Can I be honest with you? Typically, typically, I am incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=867s">00:14:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">defensive of my heart. Let's say I was caught in a lie. Let's say somebody I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=873s">00:14:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">love caught me in a lie, like my wife or my kids or my pastor or you guys, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=878s">00:14:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know, like whoever is close to me come and say, "Oh my goodness, you lied about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=881s">00:14:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that, right?" You know what I'm gonna do? Typically, my flesh is gonna be like, "Oh, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=886s">00:14:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know I did, but I had this thingy and this happened, but my intent was to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=890s">00:14:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really actually preserve you and not to hurt you, and that's why I lied. So inside,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=895s">00:14:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it was all gold, but then what came out was dirty stuff. I don't know how that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=899s">00:14:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">happened." You know, like that would be typically what I would say in defense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=904s">00:15:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of my mind and heart. Here's a question to you. The reason why I make—the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=912s">00:15:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">why I make a point of this is because what we have contained in our mind and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=918s">00:15:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">our heart, we have to be humble about. And the challenges that we're receiving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=923s">00:15:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">from this passage, we have to be ready to receive with those humble hands. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=928s">00:15:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4, Apostle Paul says the exact same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=932s">00:15:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that he says here, okay? Ephesians chapter 4, verse 22 to 24. And look at what he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=940s">00:15:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">says about the renewing of our minds. He says this, "In reference to your former</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=949s">00:15:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">manner of life, you lay aside the old self which is being corrupted in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=954s">00:15:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">accordance to the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=958s">00:15:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your mind and put on the new self which is in the likeness of God, has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=963s">00:16:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">created in righteousness and holiness of truth." So I want you to think about what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=968s">00:16:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he says right there. He says, "Putting aside this former manner of life, it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=972s">00:16:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all these lusts and deceits." And what needs to happen is you need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=977s">00:16:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">renewed in the spirit of your mind. And therefore, you're designed to all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=983s">00:16:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more put on the righteousness of God. And you're doing what the Ephesians—in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=987s">00:16:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Ephesians chapter 5—says, you're imitating and copying after God. What I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=991s">00:16:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saying is this, there was a wise, wise pastor who once said—this wise pastor is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=998s">00:16:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Peter Kim, okay? A lot of the wise things that I've learned, I've learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1001s">00:16:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from him. There was this one time where he said, "You know, sometimes we're so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1005s">00:16:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">defensive of like the condition of our heart and wondering, 'Hey, am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1010s">00:16:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">compromised or not? Did I do something that was compromising?'" It was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1014s">00:16:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting. He said, "You know, most of the time it's not even a matter of if, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1018s">00:16:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how much." And I went, "Oh, man." You know, like, it's deep. All of our hearts to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1025s">00:17:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">degree are compromised. If you're gonna sing that like child song, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1031s">00:17:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">positionally true, right? Like, "The reason I know, He saved my soul,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1035s">00:17:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">'cause I dug deep down and I found pure gold." I'm not sure if I can sing that now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1042s">00:17:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm older and I've seen my heart.

You should be asking the question, "Huh? Why?" Why would he start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1113s">00:18:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about this distinction? Why does this matter? If I ask the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1117s">00:18:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">question, what is the point here?

Whenever you study the scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1193s">00:19:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">start to meditate, and when you meditate, picture it.

You think some of them had reasons why they would resist putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1237s">00:20:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this stuff on?

Used to actually own people. And I was kind of thinking, like, in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1263s">00:21:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">day, what would be, you know, kind of indicative and apropos to that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1268s">00:21:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">comparison?

I'm just asking you to imagine, do you think people had valid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1293s">00:21:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons, at least they thought in their head, why they didn't want to apply some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1298s">00:21:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of this stuff? Probably. And then there's a convicting point for you and I, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1303s">00:21:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In our day and age, we live in an incredibly peaceful society where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1308s">00:21:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">worst enemies perhaps might be some exes, you know? But then, if a potential ex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1315s">00:21:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">whoever, an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend was like, "Apostle Paul, I don't know if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1320s">00:22:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">can put on compassion, kindness, and gentleness right now." And Apostle Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1325s">00:22:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">would look at you and say, "Dude, I just told that slave."

That's pretty convicting. And we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1338s">00:22:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize that because this letter has its actual circumstance and context of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1344s">00:22:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">people coming together in the name of Christ and he says, "Christ is all in all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1349s">00:22:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no distinction."

And we have to have that humility to accept it. Now, because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1379s">00:22:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this portion here in verse 12, he says, "So, as those who have been chosen of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1385s">00:23:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">holy and beloved."

Okay? First, "Put on a heart of compassion, kindness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1573s">00:26:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1578s">00:26:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">other, whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord forgave you.

Man, we could just camp out here and just go for forever, but this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1597s">00:26:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm gonna do, okay? If you recall that encouragement, especially when there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1602s">00:26:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">laundry list of terms, but these terms happen to be loaded terms, you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1607s">00:26:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they're big, it's important for you to do word studies, right? Word studies. And one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1612s">00:26:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the things that I use, oh no, is not that, okay? It's blueletterbible.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1621s">00:27:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now what I'm gonna show you is here, Colossians 3 verse 12 in the NASB, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1631s">00:27:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">blueletterbible.com, and it's awesome because here, look, you have these verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1636s">00:27:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and it asks you, "Do you want tools?" And I'll say, "Yes, I want them tools." And look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1642s">00:27:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">all those tools it gives me. It gives me Bibles, cross-references, commentaries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1646s">00:27:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">dictionaries, and miscellaneous. But this is why I really like it, it's because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1650s">00:27:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">makes it so easy.

So what I'll do is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1661s">00:27:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">look at this and I'll try to pronounce the word, splagnon. And then, remember how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1668s">00:27:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Peter talked about the Strong's numbers?

It gives you the pronunciation, I can even listen to it if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1677s">00:27:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to, but then the important part is just the definition. It's probably here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1684s">00:28:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it means your bowels and your intestines.

The Hebrews had this as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1701s">00:28:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">seat of tender affections. That's pretty awesome. I get to see the definitions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1707s">00:28:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I get to see the lexicon of like the different ways it's used and what's more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1711s">00:28:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see also where concordance, where else it was used. Pretty interesting, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1717s">00:28:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If I go back, just go back to this portion right here when I was looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1722s">00:28:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it, the heart of compassion, I could actually just click heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1726s">00:28:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that will do is it'll give me pretty exhaustive concordance. Now I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1730s">00:28:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">look from Genesis all the way down.

Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1797s">00:29:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of compassion and kindness like, "Hello!"

However, I want to give a caveat. Do not look at a Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1892s">00:31:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">dictionary. Look at 15 different, you know, they call them glosses, the entries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1898s">00:31:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the definitions that you see within the entry, right? And then be like, "Ooh, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1904s">00:31:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds really good. I'm gonna pick that one." You can't do that, okay? You have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1908s">00:31:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first get the general feel of how this is used generally through the Bible. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1913s">00:31:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">reread it in your text so that you know, in context, how is this being used. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1918s">00:31:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">tough part about this context is it's a laundry list of things you should do. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1923s">00:32:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what should you do? Well, I have a challenge for you. Think about how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1929s">00:32:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the concept is being perceived.

You are to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1950s">00:32:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">about these concepts as in the perfections of Christ.

None of us have these to perfection. Now, what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1981s">00:33:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">challenging for us though, is you take a concept like patience. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1987s">00:33:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why I picked this is because our pastors have been talking about it. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=1991s">00:33:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just in our past meeting, we were just like, "The Lord is so crazy patient.

"Why am I so susceptible to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/328341117#t=2033s">00:33:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">getting lost?" Right?
