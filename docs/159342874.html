href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=193s">00:03:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it is a pronouncement of judgment coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=196s">00:03:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, NAS, ESV, for whatever the reason, has decided to translate it, ah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=200s">00:03:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at these texts, there's six different places in the next four or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=204s">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">five chapters where the word woe just appears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=207s">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of connects the section together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=210s">00:03:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's meant to be understood together because of these woes that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=213s">00:03:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">connect them together, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=215s">00:03:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think most of you who guys just using the ESV probably had a hard time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=219s">00:03:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, what woe is he referring to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=221s">00:03:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we're referring to, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=224s">00:03:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the main pronouncement of judgment against Ephraim?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=229s">00:03:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, because they become proud, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=232s">00:03:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the way that he says it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=233s">00:03:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, woe, the proud crown of the drunkard of Ephraim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=236s">00:03:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get the kind of sarcasm in the way that he describes their sin, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=244s">00:04:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Their pride is in their drunkenness, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=248s">00:04:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, instead of being ashamed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=250s">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you're glorying in something that you should really be ashamed about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=254s">00:04:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And said, because of that, God's gonna bring judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=256s">00:04:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The Lord has one who is mighty and strong, and a storm overflowing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=259s">00:04:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see in between as there is pronouncement of judgment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=264s">00:04:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's also pronouncement of the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=266s">00:04:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, as I mentioned before, the closer we get to the chapter 40,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=271s">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're gonna see that the theme where right now it's predominantly judgment and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=276s">00:04:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Messiah's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/159342874#t=285s">00:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's gonna be a subtle change, and we see more of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span
