Let's gather together our attention up here. Let's go ahead and make our way over to our tables and get situated. And let's start off with a word of prayer together. Heavenly Father, we are always so thankful to you. God, we are so grateful that you bless us tremendously through the ministry of your spirit, through your word, and through your church.</p><p>God, what a blessing it is for us to be able to share of our own convictions, the things that you are teaching us, and also, Lord God, to share our prayer requests and to support each other in this way. So we wanna thank you, God, for everything you provide in this place.</p><p>We wanna take time now to gather our heart, to focus our minds, and to give to you. And Lord God, we recognize, just objectively speaking, that what we give to you is so minuscule compared to what you have already granted to us in Christ. Lord, in some sense, we give to you our time, we give to you our voices.</p><p>And what is that in the grand scale of things? But we know, Father God, that we worship because we wanna express to you, you deserve everything. God, that you own all. And Lord, that you have us. We want to express to you that you have our love, our affection, and God, we want to lift you up on high in our church.</p><p>We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name, amen. ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love is deeper ♪ ♪ Than the depths of sin and hell ♪ ♪ He who was enthroned in glory ♪ ♪ Came to bring us to himself ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love is wider ♪ ♪ Than the breach my sins have made ♪ ♪ He reached down into my darkness ♪ ♪ He alone has power to save ♪ ♪ Deeper than the rolling seas ♪ ♪ Higher than the mountain peaks ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love is stronger ♪ ♪ Than my fiercest enemies ♪ ♪ He will hold me in the tempest ♪ ♪ Through the flood he carries me ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love will lead me ♪ ♪ Through the deepest valley here ♪ ♪ He will shepherd me and guide me ♪ ♪ He will ever keep me near ♪ ♪ Deeper than the rolling seas ♪ ♪ Higher than the mountain peaks ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ Stronger than the rushing wind ♪ ♪ Shattering the power of sin ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love grows sweeter ♪ ♪ As eternity draws near ♪ ♪ I'll enjoy his love forever ♪ ♪ At his throne for endless years ♪ ♪ My Redeemer's love will fill me ♪ ♪ On the day I see his face ♪ ♪ I will love him back forever ♪ ♪ And forever sing his praise ♪ ♪ Deeper than the rolling seas ♪ ♪ Higher than the mountain peaks ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ Stronger than the rushing wind ♪ ♪ Shattering the power of sin ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ Your love is all I need ♪ ♪ ♪ When the music fades ♪ ♪ And all is stripped away ♪ ♪ And I simply come ♪ ♪ Longing just to bring ♪ ♪ Something that's of worth ♪ ♪ That will bless your heart ♪ ♪ I'll bring you more than a song ♪ ♪ For a song in itself ♪ ♪ Is not what you have required ♪ ♪ You search much deeper within ♪ ♪ Through the way things appear ♪ ♪ You're looking into my heart ♪ ♪ I'm coming back to the heart of worship ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ ♪ King of Endless Worth.</p><p>♪ King of Endless Worth ♪ ♪ No one could express ♪ ♪ How much you deserve ♪ ♪ The one we can pour ♪ ♪ All I have is yours ♪ ♪ Every single breath ♪ ♪ I'll bring you more than a song ♪ ♪ For a song in itself ♪ ♪ Is not what you have required ♪ ♪ You search much deeper within ♪ ♪ Through the way things appear ♪ ♪ You're looking into my heart ♪ ♪ I'm coming back to the heart of worship ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ ♪ I'm coming back to the heart of worship ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it ♪ ♪ When it's all about you ♪ ♪ It's all about you, Jesus ♪ Let's pray.</p><p>Dear Lord, we just are so thankful for just the gift of salvation that you've given us. We thank you and we praise you that you are holy God, that you are perfect in all your ways. And we confess, God, that oftentimes we so easily forget who you are, we forget what you've done for us, we forget who we are.</p><p>And I pray, Lord God, that you would just daily remind us just of the beauty of the gospel, the beauty of your love for us, and that we would just always be responding in proper worship, that we would respond in just bowing down at your feet in light of your holiness, in light of your love.</p><p>And as we continue to study through your word, and especially as we finish off this series, allow us to continue to glean much from your word, to be doers of your word, that we would apply your word, that we would not just come week by week and study your word and forget it, but help us to just be able to apply it.</p><p>I pray that you would be with our discussions, be with Pastor Mark, and let it be a fruitful time. In your name we pray, amen. All right, for those of you guys at the door, please make your way in. And then, as we usually do, I would like to highlight for you guys important announcements for the things coming up.</p><p>First, we're really grateful that our cafe ministry and their volunteers have opened up the cafe at different times of the week. But there's gonna be a survey just to see what kind of special hours they can offer during the summer. So the QR code is there. If you guys would take a moment, bust out your phones, do the quick, quick survey, so that the cafe ministry can think about what additional times they can open.</p><p>And that way, some of you guys who are working from home or studying, you can do that here at the church. So please go ahead and do that survey. And then, I wanna highlight that we have various classes that are going to be offered. And the first is Foundations of Marriage class that's gonna start on May 22nd.</p><p>This class is gonna be taught by all three pastors, taking one session each. And we'll cover various topics related to biblical manhood, womanhood, how to become one, conflict resolution, et cetera. And particularly for anybody who's engaged, this is gonna be actually walking them through a lot of the material that's covered in premarital counseling, okay?</p><p>It is open to the church, so even if you're not in the stage of being engaged, et cetera, or you've been married for a while, you can sign up for that. The other class is our Fourfold Disciplines of the Christian Life, taught by Pastor Peter Kim. That one's gonna overlap a little bit starting May 28th.</p><p>It'll be four sessions, okay, four sessions. And we'll cover the spiritual disciplines like our devotions, prayer, fellowship, and evangelism. So please sign up for that as well. And then, in July, later in the summer, there's going to be a parenting class. I'll be teaching that one, and that's gonna be also four sessions Thursday evenings at seven.</p><p>And we'll cover the various biblical basis for communicating with your children, establishing the authority, disciplining, and things like that. So good practices biblically of parenting, okay? So just know that those classes, you can sign up for via the QR codes that are up here, or if you just go onto our app, those sign-ups will be there.</p><p>Okay, as you guys know, we've announced our all-church retreat a few times now, but really want to encourage you guys to sign up for that early and make sure you can take benefit of the cheaper price, okay? I forget exactly at what time, but there is gonna be a point in which the prices will go up, so please make sure to register early.</p><p>The dates for that is August 1st through the 3rd. We're excited because the topic's gonna be on being set apart for God's glory, and Pastor Ray Causeley, he's gonna come and speak for us, okay? So please sign up for that, and then, please know again, the next slide is for the next Bible study, Foundations of Redemptive History.</p><p>In the next session, Pastor Pierre Kim will be going over Genesis, so please make sure you register for that. Okay, cool. Please go ahead and have a great time of discussion. We'll see you guys at eight.
