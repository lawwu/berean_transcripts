and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=102s">00:01:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">his sacrifice in chapters 1 through 15 is to prove his

href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=124s">00:02:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're now in a period where the Gentiles have taken the front seat, and then sometime</span></div><div

week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=142s">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get into the second and third point of this text, I can't emphasize enough how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=147s">00:02:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">important this particular text is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=150s">00:02:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is not to nullify all the other texts that we were in before, but as I mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=156s">00:02:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans chapter 1, he began the presentation of the gospel by basically trying to convince</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=163s">00:02:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that there was a need for a savior because all have sinned and fall short of the glory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=166s">00:02:46.540</a></span> |

necessity of Christ and his sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=172s">00:02:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we get to chapter 9 through 11, we look at the history of how God's been working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=176s">00:02:56.020</a></span> | <span

class="t">And then chapter 12 through 15, the text that we're at, which is going to end in verse 13</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=183s">00:03:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">today, is the conclusion, not only of the imperative section from chapter 12 through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=189s">00:03:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">15, but really is a conclusion of everything that he's been saying is beginning from chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=193s">00:03:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=194s">00:03:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you remember, he said that God's intent, he starts in chapter 1 by saying that all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=201s">00:03:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">have sinned and then all are sinned and is condemned, whether you are under the law or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=206s">00:03:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">not under the law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=207s">00:03:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 15, at the end of verse 13, ends with all will be saved, whether Gentiles or Jews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=218s">00:03:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Why this text?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=219s">00:03:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously why this text is so important for us to understand is because this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=223s">00:03:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">conclusion of what he's been trying to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=226s">00:03:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We still have a chapter and a half to go where Paul is going to conclude his message and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=231s">00:03:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he's going to be a lot more personal about why he's coming there and he's hoping to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=235s">00:03:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">some support to get to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=238s">00:03:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But his main thesis is coming to a conclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=242s">00:04:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've ever taken public speaking, you probably were taught that introduction is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=247s">00:04:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">extremely important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=249s">00:04:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you stand in front of people and you're trying to present something and you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=253s">00:04:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">out with the boring story or you go into your thesis and you just lose the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=260s">00:04:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I noticed that whether it's sitcom or movies, they're all like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=263s">00:04:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of starts with a bang.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=264s">00:04:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you watch a movie, that big explosion to get your attention and then it kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=268s">00:04:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">goes into the story and then it ends with some kind of a cliffhanger to kind of keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=272s">00:04:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you hanging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=274s">00:04:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever you're presenting something, whether it's from speech or cinema, you have to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=279s">00:04:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">pay attention to what's happening in the beginning and how it concludes because that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=283s">00:04:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the punch is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=286s">00:04:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the writer is hoping that you'll understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=290s">00:04:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So verse 8 through 13 is the conclusion of 15 chapters of Paul's dissertation of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=297s">00:04:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=299s">00:04:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's any text that you really, really should know, it's all the Bible, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=303s">00:05:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but then if you really need to focus on the book of Romans, you need to understand that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=309s">00:05:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what he's been leading us to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=311s">00:05:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I told you, I've been preaching on this for the last three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=315s">00:05:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And three years of conclusion comes to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=318s">00:05:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I can't emphasize enough how important this text is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=323s">00:05:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The first point we looked at last week was that Christ's sacrifice proves God's faithfulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=330s">00:05:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The text says in verse 8, "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=334s">00:05:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to show God's truthfulness."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/280036544#t=336s">00:05:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why he did that is that
