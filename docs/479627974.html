give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/479627974&t=278">00:04:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">my main focus on verse one or on the first part, and then

his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/479627974&t=288">00:04:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">comfort zone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/479627974&t=301">00:05:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/479627974&t=323">00:05:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second point is he lived all of his life by faith and not by sight.</span></div><div class="c"><span
