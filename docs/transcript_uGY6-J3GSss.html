Happy Lord's Day. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service.</p><p>We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service. We will now begin our service.

Take it to the Lord in prayer. Do your friends despise, forsake you. Take it to the Lord in prayer. In His arms, He'll take and shield you. You will find us always there. If you are visiting Berean for the first time, I want to extend a warm welcome to you.</p><p>Thank you for joining us on this Sunday morning for worship. And if you have any further questions about our church, there's a welcome booth outside. So after service, please be sure to visit the welcome booth. I do have a few announcements. If you're interested in the golf tournament, registration for the 2025 golf tournament fundraiser is now open.</p><p>All proceeds will go towards the general missions fund. So please check out the website for additional information. For first service, I made a big boo-boo and I said that this is only for members. But this is for members and non-members of the church. So please check our website for additional information.</p><p>Rookie mistake. And then this coming Sunday, July 27th, the youth group will be preparing a Korean barbecue plate. The price for that is $10 for adults and $5 for children. And the funds will go towards supporting their retreat for next year. And you can actually prepay a four-year meal if you scan the QR code.</p><p>And so I want to encourage you to please support our youth group as they are trying to raise funds for their retreat. And then, again, this coming Sunday, July 27th at 2 p.m., here at the main sanctuary, we will have a members meeting. So if you are a member, please attend our upcoming members meeting this Sunday.</p><p>If you will be absent, please fill out the form to let us know that you will be unable to attend. And then following our worship, we will have a video from the Korea mission team. And also a testimony from our brother Chase, who recently came back from Korea. And then, yeah, looking forward to hearing his testimony.</p><p>And then if you have a physical offering, please drop it off at the box near the exit there. And you can also give virtually using our app. So please prepare your hearts to give offering. But let's pray for the offering, and then we'll worship. Father, we want to thank you for this morning.</p><p>Thank you for allowing us to be here to worship you freely and to hear the proclamation of your word. At this time, as we are giving, I pray that we would give willingly and with a cheerful heart, knowing that you love those who give with a cheerful heart. Help us to realize that everything that we possess is from you.</p><p>And all we are doing is returning back to you what rightfully belongs to you, so that you may use it for your glory and for your purpose. And so I pray that even in our giving, we will worship you and that we would honor you. And so, Lord, thank you again for giving us even the opportunity to give back.</p><p>And so we pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

So I will not fear, for this truth remains. Then my God is the Ancient of Days. And above Him, known before Him, all of time in His hands. For His own it shall remain and ever stand.</p><p>All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name. My God is the Ancient of Days.

We followed up with him the next day. And now he is meeting weekly. With the LDI Church member. To study the Bible. His name is Roy. And he is a fourth year student at Yonsei. He has never been to America. And yet he had near perfect English.</p><p>Could you please pray that his heart would be the good soil. That produces the fruit of the Spirit. I was just so thankful that God was able to use us. In this miraculous way. And after that interaction. I was just thinking. Isn't this why we live? Isn't this what we live for?</p><p>God is working in Korea. And hope is not lost. There are faithful saints laboring for the Gospel. Among the younger generation. And we had the joy of co-laboring with them. We were so encouraged by them. And these are people who are sacrificing much. Because they see what many have overlooked.</p><p>The urgent need for the Gospel. The need for the Word of God. The full counsel of God to be taught clearly. Is greater than ever. So could you please continue praying. One, pray for the brothers and sisters we partnered with. That they would remain steadfast. And faithful in their Gospel work.</p><p>As it could get discouraging. And witnessing week in and week out. Could you pray for the churches in Korea. That they would not turn to the left or to the right. From the word. There is a temptation to rely on strategy. Or methods to reach the next generation. But may they trust in the simple and powerful preaching of the word.</p><p>Knowing it does not return void. And lastly. Could you please pray that God would open a door to Korea. As the need has never been clear. And that the leaders would have the wisdom and sensitivity. To know where to lead the church. Thank you for supporting us in prayer.</p><p>And for being part of the work God is doing in Korea. Thank you Chase for sharing that testimony. And as he has said. Let's please continue to pray for Korea. And that the Lord will do a mighty work there again. If you have your Bibles. I want to invite you to turn with me to James chapter 2.</p><p>James chapter 2. And this morning we're reading from verse 14. Down to verse 26. These are the words of the Lord. What use is it my brethren. If someone says he has faith. But he has no works. Can that faith save him. If a brother or sister is without clothing.</p><p>And in need of daily food. And one of you says to them. Go in peace. Be warmed and be filled. And yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body. What use is that? Even so faith. If it has no works. Is dead. Being by itself.</p><p>But someone may well say. You have faith. And I have works. Show me your faith without the works. And I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe in shudder. But are you willing to recognize. You foolish fellow.</p><p>That faith without works is useless. Was not Abraham our father justified by works. When he offered up Isaac his son on the altar. You see that faith was working with his works. And as a result of the works. Faith was perfected. And the scripture is fulfilled which says. And Abraham believed God.</p><p>And it was reckoned to him as righteousness. And he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works. And not by faith alone. So in the same way was not Rahab the harlot. Also justified by works. When she received the messengers. And sent them out by another way.</p><p>For just as the body without the spirit is dead. So also faith without works is dead. Let's say a word of prayer. Father just as our brother Chase had shared. I pray. That the mission will continue in Korea. That hearts will be cultivated. Ready to receive your word. And that you would once again.</p><p>Grant repentance to the nation. Who once sought you. I pray that you would bring them back. To truth. I pray that the church will live again. And that many people will come to repentance. At this time I pray. That as we're hearing your word. You would illuminate our hearts to receive.</p><p>And understand your word. And I pray. As James had been mentioning. Very clearly in his word. That we are not just hearers of the word. But doers. And so I pray. That you would lead us. In this time. And I pray that you would be honored. And we pray all this.</p><p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So what does it mean. To have faith. And are we saved. Because we simply make a claim to faith. faith. I want to remind you this morning. That mere profession of faith. Is not evidence of saving faith. And I do want to encourage everyone here.</p><p>To examine yourself. To see if you are truly in the faith. True. Saving faith is not revealed. By mere profession. But also by practice. If my profession of faith. Does not match my practice in life. James says. That kind of faith. Is dead. And he repeats this. In verse 17.</p><p>Verse 20. And verse 26. That without works. Faith is dead. And let me give you some context. Before we examine our text this morning. James wrote this letter. To a majority Jewish. Christian audience. Now. When the early Jewish believers. Heard the liberating truth. Of the gospel. Of our savior.</p><p>Jesus Christ. They received it with joy. And abandoned their extreme practices. Of Judaism. However. In their rejection. Of legalistic Judaism. They went to the opposite extreme. Thinking that works. Didn't matter at all. And so. James had to address this problem. In the early church. And he was saying. In effect.</p><p>That the genuineness. Of our faith. Must be revealed. In what we do. More than what we say. You see. A person. Who merely professes Christ. As Lord. But does not live. An obedient life. To honor Christ. Must examine himself. To see. If he truly is. In the faith. And I want you to understand.</p><p>That not all appearances. Of faith. Are saving faith. You can accept. The invitation. To say the sinners prayer. You can agree. With the gospel. Of Jesus Christ. That it is true. But if there isn't. Noticeable change. In your life. If there is. No evidence. Of true repentance. Producing works.</p><p>Of righteousness. Scripture. Tells us. That faith. Is a dead faith. During the baptism. Of. Or the baptism ministry. Of John. The Baptist. In other words. John. John. The Baptist. Was saying. Don't just trust. In your heritage. For your salvation. And you know. This is similar. To say. My parents.</p><p>Are Christians. And I grew up. In the church. John. John says. Don't do that. Don't count. Your heritage. For salvation. If you truly believe. God. And you belong. To him. You will give. Evidence. Of January. God. God. That is to come. God. That is to come. And then he says.</p><p>Therefore. Bear fruit. In keeping. With repentance. Not supposing. That you can say. To yourself. We have. Abraham. As our father. Our parents. Are Christians. And I grew up. In the church. John says. Don't do that. Don't count. Your heritage. For salvation. If you truly. Believe. God. And you belong.</p><p>To him. You will give. Evidence. Evidence. Of your sins. And producing. Works of obedience. Jesus said. In Matthew. Chapter 5. Verse 16. Let your light. Shine before men. In such a way. That they may see. Your good works. And glorify your father. Who is in heaven. The Holy Spirit.</p><p>We must manifest. Observable. Good works. As a testimony. Of our faith. To Jesus Christ. Then in Matthew. Chapter 7. Verse 21. Jesus said. Not everyone. Who says to me. Lord. Lord. Will enter. The kingdom. Of heaven. But he who does. The will. Of my father. Who is in heaven.</p><p>You see. It's not merely. Saying you believe. But actually. Committing yourself. To the truth. And doing the will. Of the father. Jesus is Lord. But along. With that confession. Is the commitment. To live a God. Honoring life. You know. Jesus encountered. Many superficial. Believers. During his earthly ministry. In fact.</p><p>The word of God. Tells us. In John chapter 2. Beginning in verse 23. Now. When he was in Jerusalem. At the Passover. During the feast. Many believed. In his name. Observing his signs. Which he was doing. But then verse 24. Tells us. But Jesus. On his part. Was not entrusting himself.</p><p>To them. For he knew. All men. And because. He did not need. Anyone to testify. Concerning man. For he himself knew. What was in. Man. Now. The question is. Why didn't Jesus. Entrust himself. To the many. Who believed in him. In my early experience. As a Christian. I heard.</p><p>That all I had to do. Was believe. And I'll be okay. With God. And that is until. I learned. From scripture. That salvation. Is not just saying. That I believe. Salvation. Is not just. Forgiveness of sins. But it actually. Involves. A renewed life. In Christ Jesus. You see. My salvation.</p><p>In Christ. Involves. A transformation. Of life. That surrenders. As a renewed. Desire. To honor him. In my obedience. Jesus. Did not. Entrust himself. To the Jewish people. Of that generation. Because they did not. Belong to him. You see. They believe. Certain truths. About Jesus. I mean. They witnessed. His power.</p><p>The signs. The miracles. But you see. They did not. Trust him. As their savior. Nor did they surrender. To him. As Lord. And we're going to see. In a moment. That no matter. It may be. Merely agreeing. With the facts. About Jesus. Does not count. As saving faith. John tells us.</p><p>Many came to believe. In Jesus. But in John chapter 8. Verse 31. Jesus is recorded. Speaking to the same. Group of Jewish people. Who believed in him. And this is what. He said to them. If you continue. In my word. Then you are truly. Disciples of mine. And you will know.</p><p>The truth. And the truth. Will make you free. Jesus. A true believer. In Christ. Will obey his word. And did you know. That the same. Group of Jewish people. Who believed. In Jesus. Later on. Accused Jesus. Of being born. Out of wetlock. They called him. A Samaritan. They said.</p><p>That he was. Demon possessed. And they picked up. Stones. To stone him. Because he was speaking. To the truth. To them. The truth. See Jesus knew. What was in their heart. This is why. He did not entrust himself. To them. And you know. There are many people. In the church.</p><p>Who merely profess. Faith in Jesus. But Jesus does not. Entrust himself. To them. And that is because. He knows. What's in their heart. That it is not. Committed to him. Jesus said. These people. They honor me. With their lips. But their heart. Is far from me. And you know.</p><p>Many Christians. Today. Possess. A faith. That is not. Accompanied. By works. Of obedience. They believe in God. They believe in Christ. But they don't believe it. Until the point. Of salvation. You see. They may agree. With the gospel. And accept certain truths. About Jesus. But they do not. Demonstrate.</p><p>True commitment. To him. They love hearing. About Jesus. Dying for them. On the cross. But when they're. Asked. To die to self. And obey. The commandments. In the new. They protest. And say. Well. That's legalism. And they ignore. The fact. That Jesus said. If you love me. Keep my commandments.</p><p>He said. If you love me. You will keep. My commandments. But you see. They have no desire. To demonstrate. A changed life. That comes. With true salvation. And obedience. You know. One of the faulty. Assumptions. In modern. Christianity. Is that. Mere. Acknowledgement. Of the gospel. Is sufficient. For salvation.</p><p>Just believe. Is the model. Of Christian evangelism. Today. And so. If you agree. With the gospel. All you have to do. Is walk down the aisle. And say the sinner's prayer. And you will be saved. That is what they tell them. And so. They treat the sinner's prayer. Like a formula.</p><p>For salvation. And anyone. Who simply says. The sinner's prayer. Are saved. And many of these. Christian events. Post on their. Social media page. Saying. A thousand people. Committed their lives. To Jesus. Today. And they all do this. Sometimes. Without any follow-up. To see. If any of these people. Are truly committed.</p><p>To Christ. And obedience. And if you ask me. Yes. In which a thousand people. Would commit their lives. To Jesus. As a pastor. I pray. That men. Everywhere. Would repent. And believe. In Christ. For salvation. But I want us. To think biblically. This morning. Are we saved. Because we repeated.</p><p>A few words. And made a claim. To faith. Publicly. Is that how this works. James says no. You see. Not all profession. Of faith. Is saving faith. James. Logically. Explains. Be observable. He even summarized. This by saying. In chapter one. Verse 22. That we must be. Doers of the word.</p><p>And not hearers only. And he continues. With this treaties. And wrote in our present text. That faith. If it has no works. Is dead. And by works. What he means is. He means righteous action. Or righteous behavior. A behavior. Which obeys. The commandments. Of our Lord. Scripture tells us.</p><p>In Ephesians. Chapter two. Verse 10. We are his. Workmanship. Created in Christ. Jesus. For. Good works. Which God. Prepared beforehand. That we would walk. In them. You see. God did not call us. And justify us. Freely by his son. Jesus. So that we may continue. To live. As reprobates.</p><p>In this world. God. He called us. To daily. Sanctification. So that we may. Cleanse ourselves. From all filthiness. Of the flesh. And spirit. Perfecting holiness. In the fear. Of our God. And so. How we live. Proves who we are. If I am truly. In Christ Jesus. I will present myself.</p><p>As a living sacrifice. To the Lord. In sanctification. And honor. But if I'm not. In Christ. And I merely profess. To believe who he is. I will continue on. Like the rest of the world. Always learning. And never able. To come to the knowledge. Of the truth. Professing to know God.</p><p>With my mouth. But denying him. In my works. And just so we are clear. On this matter. None of us are saved. By our works. Scripture is very clear. And it tells us. In Ephesians chapter 2. Verse 8 and 9. That we are saved. By grace. Through faith. And that not of ourselves.</p><p>It is the gift of God. Not as a result of works. So that no one may boast. And the point is. If works. Had any part. In our justification. In which we are declared. Righteous. Before a holy God. By faith in Christ. It will no longer. Be grace. And if you're listening.</p><p>To me this morning. You might be saying. This to yourself. Well wait a minute. That sounds. Like a contradiction. The apostle Paul said. That we are saved. By grace. Through faith. Where James says. We are justified. By works. And not by faith. Alone. What is going on here? Was James contradicting.</p><p>The teachings. Of the apostle Paul. When he says. Faith without works. Is dead. And the answer. To that question. Is no. There is no contradiction. Here. We are saved. By grace. Through faith. And that is. The truth. But we also. Have to understand. The doctrine. Of sanctification. That true.</p><p>Saving faith. Is not alone. For true. Saving faith. Produces. Good works. Many of you. Might have heard. The argument. That fate. Is the root. Of our salvation. And works. Is the fruit. Of our salvation. And this is true. We do not work. Because we want. To be saved. We work.</p><p>Because we are saved. You see. Paul and James. They are not contradicting. Each other. Rather. They are complimenting. Each other. The apostle Paul. Who fiercely. Defended. The doctrine. Of justification. Also wrote. In Titus. Chapter 3. Verse 8. Those who have believed. God. Will be careful. To engage. In good deeds.</p><p>And then he says. These things are good. And profitable. For men. And as I mentioned. Earlier. His audience. Were mainly. Jewish Christians. And some. Jewish Christians. Had gone from. An extreme. Legalistic. Judaism. To an opposite. Extreme. Of antinomianism. Meaning. Without law. Or against law. In other words. They replaced.</p><p>The work. Righteous system. With another. That required. No works. At all. And as a result. Their lives. From the way. They had formerly lived. And we see. This behavior. Being demonstrated. By many. Christians. Today. Oh. Grace. Grace. I'm saved. By grace. So don't. Preach. Obedience. To me. As if.</p><p>Obedience. Or legalistic. They. Misunderstand. The freedom. That we have. In Christ. And go. To the opposite. Extreme. To adultery. Christian liberty. They look. Into the law. Of liberty. Which is the gospel. Of our savior. Jesus Christ. Only to go away. And immediately. Forget. What they look like. In other words.</p><p>They make. No correction. In their life. No correction. In their behavior. They say. Oh yes. It's true. But they never. Commit themselves. To the truth. Of the gospel. To demonstrate. Works of obedience. In keeping. With repentance. And it's unfortunate. Because you can approach. Some individuals. In the church. Today.</p><p>And ask them. Do you believe. In God. And they would answer. Yes. Do you believe. Jesus Christ. Lived and died. And rose from the grave. And they will say. Yes. Of course. But then. When you observe. The Lord. At all. And I want to tell you. This this morning.</p><p>If the fruit of the spirit. Is not present. In the life. Of an individual. Claiming to be a Christian. They do not know. The Lord. Jesus said. A good tree. Does not bear. Bad fruit. Nor does a bad tree. Bear good fruit. For every tree. Is known. By its fruit.</p><p>He also said. In the New Testament. Why do you call me. Lord. And not do what I say. You know. Some individuals. May claim. To have responded. To an altar call. And I say. Great to that. They said. They said. The sinners prayer. Great. They were baptized. Great. But my question.</p><p>To them is this. How has your life. Changed since. Is it any different. Are you producing. The fruit of the spirit. In your life. Explaining good works. Of obedience. To our Lord. Anyone can have. An emotional experience. At a Christian event. And they can respond. With emotion. To what is happening.</p><p>Around them. But true. Saving faith. Is always accompanied. By a transformed life. That continues. To produce. Good works. Because faith. Without works. Is dead. And coming back. To our text. James explains. What a dead faith. Looks like. And the first characteristic. Of dead faith. Without action. Notice verse 14.</p><p>James says. What use is it. My brethren. If someone says. He has faith. But he has no works. Can that faith. Save him. You see. It's easy. For anyone. To say. I believe. I have faith. Anyone can say. That they believe. The gospel. But the point. That James is making.</p><p>Is this. Confession of faith. Is dead. Without action. And the answer. To this. Is an obvious. No. Faith. Without action. Is an empty. Confession. With no evidence. Of a change line. I mean. How can anyone. Demonstrate. A changed life. Without the product. Of faith. It's impossible. If true. Faith.</p><p>Is placed. In Christ. We're given. We're given. A new nature. In Christ. And that new nature. Will naturally. Manifest itself. In good works. And you know. James. List some of those works. That accompany. Saving faith. In this letter. For example. He mentions. Endurance. In chapter 1. Verse 3. Perseverance.</p><p>Under trial. In chapter 1. Verse 12. Purity of life. In chapter 1. Verse 27. Obedience to scripture. In chapter 1. Verse 22. And 23. Compassion for the needy. Impartiality. Acts of compassion. Control of the tongue. Humility. Truthfulness. And patience. And so the point. That James was making. Is this.</p><p>What good is it. To confess. You believe. The word of truth. Without any action. If your life. Is not demonstrated. By endurance. Perseverance. Under trials. Purity of life. Obedience to the scripture. Compassion for the needy. What kind of a faith. Is that. It is an inactive faith. A faith.</p><p>Which does not save. Salvation involves. New birth. Salvation. Is a transformation. From the old. To the new. And if salvation. Is a new birth. Then it must be. Demonstrated. By itself. In the behavior. Consistent. With that new nature. And it makes sense. That if I'm a new person. There'll be new factors.</p><p>How I conduct myself. Right. As most of you know. I am a former rebel. Saved by God's mercy. But you know. That statement means. Absolutely nothing. If I continue to. Walk like a thug. Talk like a thug. And act like a thug. In fact. I won't even be here.</p><p>I won't even be here. If I continue. To yield myself. To the desires. Of my fallen flesh. And bear. It's ugly fruit. You know who I am. I am a liar. And the truth. Is no longer in me. Scripture. Tells us. In first John. Chapter three. Verse nine. No one who is born of God.</p><p>Practices sin. Because his seed. Abides in him. And he cannot sin. Because he is born of God. When true regeneration. Takes place. And the Holy Spirit. Transforms a person. From sinner. To saint. God creates. In the soul. Of that person. A new desire. To forsake. Sin. And self. So that he will gladly.</p><p>Serve the Lord. Jesus Christ. And obey. His divine standard. Of righteousness. For example. When Zacchaeus. Believed in Jesus. He said. Look Lord. I give half of my good. To the poor. And if I have taken. Anything from anyone. By false accusation. I restore. Fourfold. Life. Also. When at Ephesus.</p><p>When the Ephesians. Trusted in Christ. And they were. Confessing. And telling of their sins. Many of those. Who practiced magic. You know what they did? They brought their books together. And they burned them all. On the side of everyone. You see. Following their conversion. To Christ. They. These believers.</p><p>Knew. That occult practices. Were evil. And it had no place. In their Christian life. In first. Thessalonians. Chapter one. Verse nine. Wrote that the believers. In Thessalonica. Had turned to God. From idols. To serve the living. And true God. That is a transformed life. That is a renewed. Heart.</p><p>That desires God. And God alone. If you're born again. If you're born again. By the spirit of God. You have received. A new nature. With a new disposition. Toward God. And because. You have a new nature. In Christ. You will progressively. Abandon. The former things. That was displeasing. To God.</p><p>And you will now. Forever. Produce works. Of righteousness. Salvation. Does not produce. Immediate perfection. And I want to make that clear. But it does give us. A new direction. And the new disposition. That hates sin. Loves the Lord. And seeks to know him. And obey him. Begins to manifest itself.</p><p>In our actions. And so the first characteristics. Of dead faith. Is a faith. Without action. Secondly. Dead faith. Is identified. In absence. Of charity. Notice again. Verses 15. And 17. If a brother. Or sister. Is without clothing. And in need. Of daily food. And one of you. Says to them.</p><p>Go in peace. Be warmed. And be filled. And yet. You do not give them. What is necessary. For their body. What use is that? Even so. Faith. If it has no works. Is dead. Being by itself. James. Makes a point. By comparing. Faith. Without works. To words. Of charity.</p><p>Without the works. Of charity. And so. In this scenario. We see. A poor brother. Or sister. Who is without clothing. And without daily food. And I want you to notice. In the text. That the insufficiently clothed. And destitute person. Isn't some stranger. That randomly walked. Into the church. But it's a brother.</p><p>Or sister. In other words. They belong. To the household of God. They are members. Of the local church. As members. As members. Of this church. They are Christians. And because. It was common. In the early church. To have poor. Brothers and sisters. Who lacked. The basic necessities. Even the apostle.</p><p>John. Has something. To say. About this. In first. John. Chapter 3. Verse 17. But whoever has the world's goods. And sees his brother. In need. And closes his heart. Against him. How does the love of God. Abide in him. Little children. Let us not love. With word. Or with tongue.</p><p>But in deed. And in truth. And so here. Is a brother or sister. Cold and hungry. The rest of the congregation. See them in their church. They see their condition. They know that. They're insufficiently clothed. They know that. They're destitute. Of daily food. But they say to them. Go in peace.</p><p>Be warmed and filled. And they do this. Without giving them. Any aid. James says. This is an attitude. Of total disregard. For those. Who are in need. To the point. Of absurdity. This doesn't make. Any sense. You're telling. A brother or sister. Who is insufficiently clothed. And he is destitute.</p><p>Of daily food. Go in peace. Be warmed. And be filled. As if that brother. Or sister. Would not have done so. If they were able. And the point. That James is making. Is that just like. Faith without works. Is dead. So words of charity. Like go in peace. Be warmed.</p><p>And be filled. Is worthless. Without its actions. It's worthless. Without its works. At the end of verse 16. James says. If you do not give them. What is necessary. For their body. What use is that? In other words. What good. Does that kind of faith. Serve. Let's. You confess.</p><p>To believe in God. A loving. Merciful. And compassionate. God. But you don't have. Any concern. For those. Who are in need. Within your own congregation. What faith is that? James says. In verse 17. It is a dead faith. We read in Galatians. Chapter 6. Verse 10. While we have opportunity.</p><p>Let us. Good. Let us do good. To all people. And then notice. What he says. In the following. And especially. To those. Who are the house. Of the faith. Especially. To those. Who are. Christians. In Matthew. Chapter 25. Jesus taught us. To have a special obligation. To help. Fellow believers.</p><p>Jesus. And that is indicated. By the word. My brethren. In the passage. Jesus said. In Matthew. Chapter 25. Beginning. In verse 31. When the son of man. Comes in his glory. And all the holy angels. With him. Then he will sit. On the throne. Of his glory. And all the nations.</p><p>Will be gathered. Before him. And he will separate them. One. From another. As a shepherd. Divides his sheep. From the goats. And he will set the sheep. On his right hand. But the goats. On the left. We are all going to be. Partakers of this. We are all going to be there.</p><p>Verse 34. Then the king. Will say to those. On his right hand. Come. You blessed of my father. Inherit the kingdom. Prepared for you. From the foundation. Of the world. For I was hungry. And you gave me food. I was thirsty. You gave me drink. I was a stranger.</p><p>You took me in. I was naked. And you clothed me. I was sick. And you visited me. I was in prison. And you came to me. Then verse 37. Then the righteous. Will answer him saying. Lord. When do we see you hungry. And feed you. Or thirsty. And give you drink.</p><p>When do we see you. A stranger. And take you in. Or naked. And clothe you. Or when do we see you. Sick. Or in prison. And come to you. Say to them. Surely I say to you. In as much as you did it. To one of the least of these.</p><p>My brethren. You did it to me. You see. Works of compassion. Toward fellow Christians. Is an act of obedience. And service to Christ. But to ignore the needs. Of fellow Christians. Is an act of disobedience. To the law. The royal law. Which commands us. To love one another. But I do want to be clear here.</p><p>I want to qualify this. Because this does not mean. That the church. Should be responsible. To care for everyone. Without discernment. You see. We don't just give aid. To any individual. Who visit our church. And says. I'm a Christian. And I need money. We have to understand. That the church.</p><p>Is not a social welfare system. If an individual. Is capable of work. If they're capable of work. But they refuse to work. Because of idleness. Or laziness. And they lack the means. To provide for themselves. As a result of that. The church. Is not responsible. To aid such an individual.</p><p>Now. If you feel compelled. To be generous. You may help that individual. But it's not a must. For scripture. Is very clear. If anyone is not willing. To work. He is not to eat. And they're commanded. To work in quiet fashion. And eat their own bread. However. We must assist.</p><p>Our brothers and sisters. Who has a reputation. Of good works. And an unwavering devotion. To the Lord. You see. When a brother or sister. Fall into hard times. Despite their very best efforts. To find a job. We who are able. Should come to their aid. If a brother or sister.</p><p>Fall into poverty. As a result of calamity. Or a result of oppression. Or a result of oppression. We must come to their aid. We must come to their aid. We must not use words of compassion. Flippantly. And saying to our brothers in need. You know what? I'll pray for you.</p><p>Go in peace. When we do that. When we do that. We are. We're just using. Words of charity. Without the works. We're sending them away. Without giving them. What is necessary. And so. Our words of charity. Must parallel. The works of charity. We must not just love. With word.</p><p>But with deed. And in truth. And finally. Dead faith is identified. By shallow conviction. Notice with me. Verses 18 and 20. But someone may well say. You have faith. And I have works. Show me your faith. Without the works. And I will show you my faith. By my works.</p><p>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe. And shudder. But are you willing to recognize. You foolish fellow. That faith without works. Is useless. Now here's the point. Of this illustration. For argument's sake. Let's say an individual. Professes to have faith. Which is independent.</p><p>From his works. How do you know. That his faith is genuine. There's no way of telling. I know most of you. Will ask me to prove myself. If I made a claim. That I can do a cartwheel. And a triple backflip. Right. First service. Everyone was laughing at me.</p><p>Because they know. I can't do it. Right. But you would ask me. Prove yourself. You made this claim. I want you to prove yourself. And that is because. You want me to back up my claim. With the proof of action. And so James make a. Makes a clear. And logical argument.</p><p>That we can't see. Someone's faith. faith. But you know what we can see. We can see their works. Remember the words of Jesus. Who said. You will know them by their fruit. He did not say. You will know them by their words. You will know them by their fruit.</p><p>You will know them by their action. And so anyone claiming to possess. Faith without works. Is committing a fallacy. True saving faith. Can never stand alone. Genuine faith. Is always occupied with works. James says in verse 17. Faith by itself. If it has no works. Is dead. Faith without works.</p><p>Is not faith. And it is certainly not saving faith. I stated before. Genuine faith. Will produce good works. Because that is the nature. And purpose of it. Anyone can say that they're serious. About their faith. But again. How will they prove it? What's the litmus test for faith? How does one measure.</p><p>The seriousness. Of their commitment to the Lord? You see. It would be absolutely impossible. To demonstrate saving faith. Without its works. As the saying goes. And we all know this. Right? Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder than words. James says. Show it to me. I want to see it.</p><p>And if there is no works. If there is no fruit of righteousness. There is no way. To demonstrate the legitimacy. Of that faith. But on the other hand. James says. I will show you my faith. By my works. If we profess to have saving faith. In Christ Jesus. It must be a faith.</p><p>That works. You see. True faith. Does not merely hear the word. But does the word. The word. And so. The reality. Of our faith in Christ. Must be demonstrated. By works. Then James says. In verse 19. If you notice. You believe. That God is one. You do well. The demons.</p><p>Also believe. In shutter. And I remember. Reading this passage. For the first time. Is very interesting. Because. Did you know. That demons. Are not atheists. They're not even. Agnostics. They believe. In God. They believe. In the one. True God. But. Did you know. That the fallacy. Of faith. Without works.</p><p>Is also. Demonstrated. They believe. God. And what is. Interesting. Is that. Even their. Theology. Is correct. Because. They believe. God. Is one. They also. Believe. In the deity. Of Christ. There is. No challenge. There. Remember. When Jesus. Encountered. Demons. During his. Earthly. Ministry. They testified. That Jesus. Is who.</p><p>The son. God. And yes. If you would like. To argue. They even know. The scriptures. Probably better. Than most. Christians. Today. They believe. Everything. About God. And they. Shutter. But the question. Is. Are demons. Saved. No. Demons. Believe. And acknowledge. God. But their belief. And acknowledgement. Of God. Does nothing.</p><p>For them. In a similar way. An individual. Can be enlightened. In his mind. With the word. Of truth. They can be orthodox. In what they know. For example. They could agree. That there is. One God. In Trinity. That Jesus. Is the son of God. That salvation. Is by grace.</p><p>Through faith. That Jesus died. On a Roman cross. That he was buried. And he rose back. To life. On the third day. Ascending back. But knowing. All of this. They could still be lost. Knowing all the truth. Knowing. And be orthodox. They could still be lost. And this is because.</p><p>True saving faith. Involves something. More than just. Knowing about the truth. It's more than just. Agreeing with the truth. True saving faith. Involves something. That can be seen. And recognized. Transformed life. Again. Quoting verse 18. Show me your faith. Without your works. And I will show you. My faith.</p><p>By my works. Then we move on. To verse 20. James says. Are you willing. To recognize. You foolish fellow. That faith. Without works. Is useless. And here. James prepares us. For a history lesson. From the Old Testament. To demonstrate. That genuine faith. Is always. Accompanied. By works. And James.</p><p>Uses. Two accounts. From the Old Testament. To prove. His point. That genuine faith. Is demonstrated. By works. Of obedience. And I'm going to give. Attention. To just one of those. Which is the account. Of Abraham. Beginning. In verse 21. So if you notice. In verse 21. Here. James gives us.</p><p>A brief history lesson. He said. Was not Abraham. Our father. Justified by works. You see. That faith. Was working. With his works. And as a result. Of the works. Faith. Was perfected. And the scripture. Was fulfilled. Which says. Abraham believed God. And it was reckoned to him. As righteousness.</p><p>And he was called. The friend of God. You see. That a man. Is justified. By works. Faith alone. Faith alone. Now James. Is not contradicting. The doctrines. Of justification. By faith. Again. We have to understand. That James. Is not dealing. With the means. Of salvation. But rather. The outcome.</p><p>Of salvation. James's argument. Is that. If you claim. To have faith. In Christ Jesus. If you truly. Experience. The love of God. Through Christ Jesus. And know. That he is good. Your faith. Will demonstrate. Works of obedience. Outwardly. And just as our faith. Is tested. For genuineness. So was the faith.</p><p>Of Abraham. And that's the point. That James. Is making here. Abraham's faith. Was publicly. Displayed. When he offered. His son. Isaac. On the altar. You see. The reality. Of Abraham's faith. In God. Was declared. By his actions. And I want us. To understand. Abraham. He was not. A perfect man.</p><p>And the scripture. Does not say. That Abraham. Was a perfect man. But you know. Who he was. He was a man. Who trusted God. And you know. The reality. Of his faith. In God. Was demonstrated. On that day. When God. Told Abraham. To offer. His only. Beloved son. As a burnt.</p><p>Offering. And can you think. Of. A test of faith. More severe. In degree. Than the one. That Abraham. Was willing. To go through. Through. But you see. Abraham. Was willing. To go through. With it. You know. Why? Because he trusted. God. Abraham stood firm. In the promise. Of God.</p><p>That God. Will multiply. His descendants. Through his son. by faith before God, but he was justified not simply by agreeing with God, but by his works of obedience. And that's the point. That is the point that James is making. Faith was coupled together with works, and by works, faith was made perfected.</p><p>Jesus said, every tree that does not bear fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits, you will know them. And we're all smart people here, but bearing fruit is an integral part of a tree. That's what it was designed to do. And you know, even before a seed is planted into the soil, it contains all the genetic information that it needs to produce its own kind of fruit.</p><p>And in the same way, when an individual is regenerated by the Spirit of God, given new life in Christ by the Holy Spirit, he has given a new nature by God. And that individual is given all the spiritual genetics to produce works of obedience. And that is the sense in which faith is perfected.</p><p>It produces fruit for which it was designed. And so just as a fruit tree has not fulfilled its purpose until it bears fruit, so also faith has not been perfected until it demonstrates itself in works of obedience to God. And that is the sense in which Abraham was justified by works.</p><p>His willingness to sacrifice Isaac was that works by which his justification by faith was demonstrated and made manifest before men. And because of his faith, notice at the end of verse 23, James says, Abraham was called a friend of God. You know, the great privilege of the faithful is to be called a friend of God.</p><p>Many of us want to be friends with God. And you know, we can all agree that friendship is important because friendship, it actually enriches our lives in so many ways, right? All of you who have friends, you will agree with me. When you have friends, it prevents isolation and loneliness.</p><p>When you have friends, it actually increases our sense of belonging and purpose in this world. And you know, friends, they keep each other accountable and we comfort one another through life's many challenges. And I want you to think of all the times that you rejoice with those who rejoice and you mourn with those who mourn.</p><p>That is friendship. But you know, adding to our existing and wonderful friendship that we have with one another, we have a divine friend who loves us, who willingly laid down his life for us to save us. But for those who are seeking friendship with the Lord, you might be asking the question, well, how can we know that we are friends of Jesus?</p><p>Jesus said in John chapter 15, verse 14, you are my friends if you do whatever I command you. How do I know I'm a friend of Jesus? By my obedience to his commands. Friendship with God is reserved for people who obey him. A friend of God obeys God. A friend of God imitates God.</p><p>And we know an individual is a friend of God by the way he lives his life. And so if you profess to believe, but have no works, the word of God tells us you have a dead faith. Not an incapable faith, not a disabled faith, but necros, it's dead.</p><p>It's a dead faith. James says, faith without works is like a body without a spirit in verse 26. And what is a body without its spirit? It's a corpse. It's a corpse. It's dead. It's dead. In the same way, faith without works is dead. And so I pray, brothers and sisters here this morning, that our confession of faith does not lack action.</p><p>I pray that our words of charity will always be followed by the works of charity. And I pray that our knowledge of Jesus Christ moves beyond an intellectual ascent, moves beyond just saying, I know, I know. But it moves beyond that to true godly conviction, so that we may have life in his name.</p><p>I pray for all of us here this morning that we possess true saving faith that works. That our faith is demonstrated by works for the glory of our God. Let's say a word of prayer. Father, again, thank you for this time. And just as you had reminded us in your inspired scripture, I pray that we will not just be hearers of the word, but doers.</p><p>If we truly had experienced your grace and mercy by your son, Jesus Christ, I pray that you will remind us of the transformed life we have. For you, I stated that we are new creations in Christ. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things become new. And I pray that we will continuously live in the newness of life to bring you honor and praise.</p><p>That you so deserve. And so, Lord, thank you again for the time here. Again, I pray for my brothers and sisters that they're not just hearers, but doers. And I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let us all rise for our close peace.
