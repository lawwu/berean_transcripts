And what's more, you continue to lead us every single day through your fatherly love. We pray, Lord, that our response to you would be one of utter trust, great submissiveness, and, Lord, a kind of life that's bearing the fruit of obedience.</p><p>And so every time we come together, I pray that this would not just simply be a weekly activity for us, but rather a sweet, sweet time of worship, of learning, of connecting with you spiritually. So, Father God, we pray for the time of service we have, but also, God, we pray for the offering that we give in worship and in finances.</p><p>I ask, Lord, that this, too, would be a reflection, expression, Lord God, of the fruit that we bear. Of a fruit of thankfulness, of a fruit of worship. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.
