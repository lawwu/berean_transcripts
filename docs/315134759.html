So what's happening in the book of Hebrews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=265s">00:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is Leviticus points to the Christ that is coming. Hebrews points to Christ who came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=271s">00:04:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and points us back to Leviticus of what happened. So the best time to study the book of Hebrews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=278s">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">would be now right after we studied the book of Leviticus while it is still fresh in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=282s">00:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mind while your perspective from the Leviticus is still you know fresh and we just studied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=290s">00:04:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it and so much of it is going to make so much more sense now that we study it in light of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=295s">00:04:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">certain things that we wrestled with in the book of Leviticus. But it's the only reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=301s">00:05:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">why we're studying the book of Leviticus. If it was simply to connect the dots from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=305s">00:05:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the Old Testament to the New Testament then we would be wasting our time. You can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=309s">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">read a book and read a commentary and says this is how Jesus fulfilled this and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=313s">00:05:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is what Jesus did. Oh that's interesting. But the ultimate goal of the book of Hebrews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=318s">00:05:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is not to simply connect the dots with the Old and the New Testament. It is important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=322s">00:05:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">much of what we're going to study is going to be doing that. But there is a greater purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=328s">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a reason beyond just theological knowledge of who Jesus is. This letter was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=337s">00:05:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">written around 65 to 69 AD. Anybody know what was happening? Something very significant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=346s">00:05:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was happening during this period particularly for Christians.

The way we contextualize it is, "Well what does the cross mean to me? What do I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=545s">00:09:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">need to sacrifice?

So we symbolize it in application. The recipients</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=557s">00:09:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of this letter, the cross wasn't symbolic, it was literal. When Jesus said, "You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=562s">00:09:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to pick up your cross," it was literally some of these men and women were being crucified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=566s">00:09:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for their faith, burned at the stake, being torn apart by lions. And as a result of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=572s">00:09:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these people who are bold in the lesser persecution were beginning to drift back because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=577s">00:09:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all they needed to do to avoid this persecution is not to reject Christ but to simply keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=585s">00:09:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">their mouth shut.

He talks about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=598s">00:09:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">drifting. He talks about neglecting.

But the reason why persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=652s">00:10:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming is because they're trying to proselytize.

They were, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=672s">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because the Jews got along with the Romans fine as long as they kept their religion and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=675s">00:11:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they just practiced what they believed, they just kind of allowed them to exist.

Because tomorrow you may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=968s">00:16:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">not be here, but the odds are, you know, say, "Okay, my chances are good that I will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=972s">00:16:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here." But the other part of that equation is, tomorrow your heart may be so hardened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=978s">00:16:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that the Word of God makes no sense. If you harden your heart, when God convicts you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=985s">00:16:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you say, "Hey, tomorrow," your heart will become that much harder. It's kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=989s">00:16:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">clay and you leave it out and you don't use it to mold what you intended. Next thing you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=993s">00:16:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">know, you have a clay that you can't mold anymore. And what you don't realize, you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=998s">00:16:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't realize, is when God convicts us, it is the grace of God that brings us to repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1006s">00:16:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we resist the grace of God to bring us to repentance, you may wake up tomorrow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1011s">00:16:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and no longer have a desire to repent. And that's a typical thing that happens when somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1016s">00:16:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">postpones obedience. They wake up three weeks later, three years later, and all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1022s">00:17:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">no desire. It's just not there. They become so numb, not realizing that you've drifted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1030s">00:17:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">far from God. And that's why He repeatedly says, "Today, if you hear His voice, if God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1037s">00:17:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is being gracious to you today, if God is bringing you to obedience today, do not postpone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1044s">00:17:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it till tomorrow." So there is a sense of urgency, not simply to connect the dots between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1048s">00:17:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, the Old Testament, and the New Testament, but there's a reason why these dots are connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1052s">00:17:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to bring us to obedience, to repentance. Hebrews chapter 3, verse 12, "Take care, brethren,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1060s">00:17:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1065s">00:17:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">living God." To fall away, to neglect, to drift, simply by what? Doing nothing. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1075s">00:17:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">become hearers and not doers. Whenever we hear about the Word of God, we feel convicted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1080s">00:18:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we have warm feelings about encouragement, we look forward to go to heaven, but that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1084s">00:18:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And we begin to drift and our heart becomes hardened. So when our hearts become hardened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1091s">00:18:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">toward the things of God, toward our own salvation, Hebrews chapter 13, "Do not neglect to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1097s">00:18:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hospitality to poor strangers." Do not, verse 16, "Do not neglect doing good and sharing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1103s">00:18:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if we neglect our salvation, the natural response is to neglect the application of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1108s">00:18:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that salvation. So he says, "Do not neglect hospitality." Do not neglect good works. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1115s">00:18:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason why I chose Hebrews, obviously, is because we just finished Leviticus, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1121s">00:18:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're trying to connect the dots, and it'll make a lot more sense to you. But the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1125s">00:18:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">reason behind that is, and the more significant reason is, this is usually where most Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1132s">00:18:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will land. You go through your faith, you get baptized, you remember when you first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1139s">00:18:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">got saved and how excited you were, and then after two, three, four, five years, disappointment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1145s">00:19:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with yourself, disappointment with life, disappointment maybe with church and friends, and then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1150s">00:19:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just kind of learn to exist. And when we get to that point where our heart is no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1156s">00:19:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">excited for the things of God, and after a while you just accept that as being normal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1162s">00:19:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and you begin to drift.

That's usually the struggle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1186s">00:19:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of most Christians, whether we are here or abroad. So what the author of Hebrew addresses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1195s">00:19:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is relevant to every single one of us, including myself. That we don't neglect our salvation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1202s">00:20:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we do not drift. Because the consequence of this drifting is not simply just feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1208s">00:20:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bad or not having passionate worship. He says in Hebrews chapter 6, 4-8, "For in the case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1215s">00:20:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1219s">00:20:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1224s">00:20:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1229s">00:20:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">again to repentance, and since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1234s">00:20:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Him to open shame." A lot of people read this passage and they get confused. Is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1239s">00:20:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about Christians who lose their salvation? Now, again, we said you have to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1246s">00:20:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the context, in the context of the New Testament and Old Testament, because you didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1250s">00:20:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">choose salvation, you can't lose salvation. Then what does he mean here? That if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1256s">00:20:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">tasted the goodness of God and the Holy Spirit, and then you fall away, there is no other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1260s">00:21:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">repentance.

He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1266s">00:21:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about people who confess their faith.

People who went to short-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1278s">00:21:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">mission, maybe Sunday school teachers, worship leaders, leaders at one point. And they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1285s">00:21:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">persevere in their faith, and they begin to put their hope in something else outside of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1289s">00:21:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. He said there is no other way of salvation but Christ. So if you drift from Christ, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1296s">00:21:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is no repentance. That's what he means. Verse 7, "For the ground that drinks the rain, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1304s">00:21:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is tilled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1311s">00:21:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">receives a blessing from God." In other words, here's the same rain that falls on the ground,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1315s">00:21:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but this ground comes up and it bears fruit and the Lord blesses it.

We've all experienced the struggles, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1349s">00:22:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">yet one produced fruit, the other one produced bitterness and thorns and thistles. He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1356s">00:22:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the consequence of not persevering and just drifting from your faith, there is no other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1364s">00:22:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">repentance, there is no other salvation. So the moment we no longer cling to Christ, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1372s">00:22:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are lost. So he's not simply saying, "Hey, if you want to have an easy life, make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1378s">00:22:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that you cling to Christ.

So the theme and the primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1530s">00:25:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">teaching in the book of Hebrews is Jesus is better than...

In the Old Testament Jewish mind, there's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1542s">00:25:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than the angels. It's God and then the angels. So he starts out from the very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1547s">00:25:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning with a bang. He doesn't start out and say, Jesus is better than your mom, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1551s">00:25:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">better than your grandfather. He starts from the top. He's greater than the angels. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1558s">00:25:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">then he kind of goes down the list. Chapter 3, Jesus is better than Moses, the greatest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1564s">00:26:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">leader in Israel's history. And then chapter 4, it says Jesus is better than Joshua. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1570s">00:26:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these people were constantly living, thinking like, man if we had another Joshua to deliver</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1574s">00:26:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">us from the Roman grasp. He says, Jesus is better than Joshua. And then Hebrews chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1582s">00:26:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">5 and on, he says, Jesus is better than Aaron and his priesthood. And so that's where he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1589s">00:26:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">begins to connect us to the book of Leviticus and all the sacrificial system. Because he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1594s">00:26:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">better than Aaron, he comes in the order of the priesthood of Melchizedek. His priesthood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1600s">00:26:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is better, his sacrifice is better, his covenant is better, and his salvation is better, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1608s">00:26:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">his rest is better.

That's the argument and that's the premise of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1656s">00:27:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Hebrews. But the goal is not simply to ask the question, is he better? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1663s">00:27:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we can say, yes he's better. But that's not where the author of Hebrews leaves us. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1668s">00:27:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we confess that every single time we come to church on Sunday. We sing songs. And every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1674s">00:27:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">single one of these songs says, it's a confession, Jesus is better. He's better than the lily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1681s">00:28:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the valleys. Right? He's better. We sing it all the time, it's our confession. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1686s">00:28:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the goal of Hebrews is not simply to get us to confess. Over and over again we'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1691s">00:28:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the word therefore. Remember? In interpretation when you see therefore, you have to ask, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1700s">00:28:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is the therefore, therefore? Why is that there? Because therefore connects us to what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1705s">00:28:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">been saying. So every time he would tell us about Jesus being better, he says, therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1712s">00:28:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you ought to do this. Chapter 4 verse 1, therefore let us fear while a promise remains of entering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1719s">00:28:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">his rest. You know that idea of fearing in the New Testament? For whatever the reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1726s">00:28:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we have erased that vocabulary in the New Testament. And it almost sounds like heresy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1733s">00:28:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">when somebody says, we need to fear. Because it sounds strange. But if you've read your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1740s">00:29:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible from Genesis to Revelation, one of the primary things that God tells his people is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1749s">00:29:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to fear him. In fact, the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon says, the chief end of man is to fear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1755s">00:29:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">God and obey his commandment. The apostle Paul says, live out your salvation with fear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1762s">00:29:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and trembling. So we've somehow made, we took it, taken one verse where it says, love casts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1770s">00:29:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out fear. So anything that causes any kind of fear is heresy. Completely unbiblical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1776s">00:29:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at scripture all over the Bible.

If you don't fear losing your job, a job that you loved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1809s">00:30:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and prayed for, and you go, I don't care if I lose my job, then you're going to lose your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1812s">00:30:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">job. You're probably not going to be a good worker. Fear of being a bad parent causes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1818s">00:30:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you to examine the way you parent your kids.

So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1832s">00:30:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">a healthy fear. There is a bad fear, and that's what he was talking about when he says, love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1838s">00:30:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">casts out fear. In other words, if you are assured with the love of God, then it casts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1842s">00:30:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">out the fear of judgment. But fear in and of itself, fear of the Lord in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1849s">00:30:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is necessary. He says, "Therefore, fear while a promise remains entering his rest." If you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1854s">00:30:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">seen yourself drift and you've been neglecting your faith for periods of time, it should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1863s">00:31:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">be fear that you feel, not comfort and encouragement, because that fear is what will bring you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315134759#t=1870s">00:31:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ.
