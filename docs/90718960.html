The description of this first process, I guess, order of salvation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=14s">00:00:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is when God chooses the people to be saved. That's called?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=18s">00:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=19s">00:00:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The election. Okay. And then next comes the proclaiming of the message of the Gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=26s">00:00:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=30s">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=31s">00:00:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Calling.

And then comes this one act, the two sides of this one act, this faith and repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=49s">00:00:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=50s">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Conversion. And then the right legal standing before God. So, this is a declaration of God on us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=59s">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=60s">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is justification. God giving us the right to have membership in His family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=66s">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=67s">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Adoption. And then conforming to Christ is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=71s">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=72s">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=73s">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, next we're going to be covering perseverance, the remaining as a Christian and then fighting this fight of faith or running this race of endurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=83s">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to talk about death and glorification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=85s">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But before we do that, today there is a need to have a discussion in the realm of sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=93s">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why is because, obviously in terms of our salvation, our sanctification is a huge aspect in terms of even a timeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=103s">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like we said last time, there has been a lot of confusion about sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=108s">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And today what we're going to be talking about is in the realm or discussion of sanctification, there has been a discussion of what does it mean to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=120s">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, asked another way, what does it mean to walk in the Spirit of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=125s">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And are those two the same things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=127s">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Being baptized in the Spirit of God or walking in the Spirit of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=131s">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because during our time here in sanctification, during our time as Christians trying to be living lives, sanctified lives into God, we want to be walking in the Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=142s">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now what does that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=144s">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we want to have this discussion because in recent history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=149s">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say recent, I don't mean like last year, I mean in the last 100 years, there has been great confusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=155s">00:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The little blank that we start off at number one is the word Pentecostalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=160s">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">P-E-N-T, actually it says the spread of Pentecostalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=165s">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there has been a spread of a theology, of a certain doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=174s">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this spread of doctrine has started, began in 1901 when Charles Farnham, basically what he believed was that as he observed in the New Testament, there were great, powerful acts of miracles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=186s">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Given to the disciples of Christ when they had true faith and when they were baptized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=191s">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he believed that the acts of miracles that are seen in the New Testament can be practiced in modern day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=198s">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that first and foremost comes about when the believer is baptized in the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=205s">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you are baptized in the Holy Spirit, it's going to show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you are baptized in the Holy Spirit, you are going to see a change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=212s">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of these great changes that you are going to see is you are going to be able to communicate with the Lord in an angelic voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=217s">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You are going to be able to speak in tongues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=220s">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this basically started to carry on for many, many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the 1960s and 70s, the great charismatic movement started to really pervade the Christian land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The landscape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=233s">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the charismatic movement carried that doctrine basically was that the miracles that you see in the New Testament can be practiced today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=240s">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that a Christian who is walking with the Lord will have a basically like a second experience of baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=248s">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They will have a post-converted experience of baptism which is the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that continued to grow and move and now there are many, many denominations affecting millions of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=259s">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Millions of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To name a couple of these just so you guys are aware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=265s">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is, so Pentecostalism is pretty huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=269s">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But within that, underneath that, there are different denominations and there are different fellowships of churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=275s">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how many of you guys have heard of the group Assemblies of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=279s">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Assemblies of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=281s">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you kind of wonder, it is like, are we all Assemblies of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=286s">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we all, you know, and there is another group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=290s">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Assemblies of God is one major group in the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=293s">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the second largest Pentecostal church in the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=296s">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The biggest Pentecostal church in the US is called Church of God in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=300s">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you see Churches of God, Churches of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=303s">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I was wondering, they always use these names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=305s">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I am like, does that refer to all of us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=308s">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that so confusing, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=310s">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, for the longest time, did not know what was the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=313s">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I did research, basically I was able to kind of hone in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=318s">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those churches started with a movement called the Holiness Movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Holiness Movement essentially bloomed into the Pentecostal Movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=327s">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, essentially the Pentecostal Movement overtook that movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=331s">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what you have in our current day, modern day 2014,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=335s">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in its broadest branch is the Pentecostal Movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=340s">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why do we talk about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is because they hold this doctrine that is true for any genuine Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=347s">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I asked the question, what is supposed to be the universal experience of conversion for every genuine Christian?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the universal experience, meaning every single one of us needs to go through this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=358s">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=359s">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they would say, you need to have the Spirit baptism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=364s">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that is why we have to engage in this conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=367s">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is why we have to engage in this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=369s">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, this is also really important for us because, yeah, okay, now, I understand now what they are saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/90718960#t=376s">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, is that the same thing as when our pastor, Pastor
