walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=147s">00:02:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with Christ simply asked a theological question or maybe

passages in Scripture to swallow, to comprehend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=174s">00:02:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you saying that there are individuals who would actually want, they have a desire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=178s">00:02:58.360</a></span> | <span

the very first point I have for you in looking at that answer that Christ gives is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=187s">00:03:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is a huge moment for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=189s">00:03:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something of a privilege because there is a natural limitation to what Jesus says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=194s">00:03:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point is, what you participate in today, only very few can say that they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=219s">00:03:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in his answer, he answers indirectly, but the way that he answers clearly says the statement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=226s">00:03:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of the reality that it is a limited few.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=229s">00:03:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, we need to have a very thankful attitude, a very privileged attitude of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=234s">00:03:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that has been given a narrow door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=238s">00:03:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A narrow door by which we must enter has been given to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=243s">00:04:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He continues this theme of having a limited nature by the things he says next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256519442#t=248s">00:04:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Take a look at verse 25 and
