And I know we've been live streaming for a while, but to do it as our main service, it's gonna take a little bit of tweaking. And so each week we may have certain things that are different, but again, just be patient with us.</p><p>Our guess is that we're gonna be doing this for at least a month. Hopefully it won't go longer than that. If there's any time where our leaders need prayer, we're talking about the governmental leaders, it is now. The Bible tells us that we need to be praying for our leaders, and those who are in authority, so that we may live peaceful and quiet lives.</p><p>We need to be praying for our president. We need to be praying for the vice president. We need to be praying for our governor and the local leaders. So if there's any time where we need to put aside our party affiliations and political views, it is now. That they would make sound judgments as what is best for the country, best for the world.</p><p>And again, that no matter where you stand politically, this is a time we really need to be praying for our leaders. I wanna get to a few things of announcements before we start our praise. First of all, since we're online, there's gonna be more and more things that we're gonna be trying to address online.</p><p>Our website, Facebook, Instagram. Our leaders are talking almost daily to talk about how can we keep the church connected during this time. And so if you go onto our Facebook page, you've probably already seen a lot of stuff being posted on Instagram already. And our media team is working overtime to make sure that all this is being taken care of.</p><p>But if you can check more regularly, if you're one of those people that only checks Facebook every once in a while, we encourage you while you're at home to at least check as often as you can because we're gonna try to put more content on there, whether it is video, whether it is encouragement.</p><p>So again, be patient with us. We're gonna be doing that, and things are gonna be changing day to day. As an announcement going forward, our Easter events that was scheduled for the next, I think, two to three weeks coming up, we are gonna be having those. We're not canceling any of those.</p><p>But obviously, we're gonna be going online. So the devotions that we plan to do during the weekday, we're gonna be having that online. So our pastors are gonna be leading us through devotions of what's going on each day with the testimonies. Thursday night when we had our Passover meal, obviously we're not gonna be able to do that.</p><p>But there will be a devotion that will be given that night as well. And then the Good Friday, we won't be able to physically gather, but assuming that we are still at the same stage, that we're gonna be having Good Friday online as well and Sunday service. Most likely, we will not have early-rise service, but just kind of give you a heads up.</p><p>So if you're inviting people to watch with you or just kind of give them the website, just let them know that all those things are taking place, and we're in the process right now of trying to get all that stuff ready. A couple of things that, again, I wanna, since today is our first time, I've given you the outlines of the sermon.</p><p>Our AV team, which right now is Richard Lee, he basically put, he was able to put the outline onto the page. So you're gonna see as I'm speaking, the outline is gonna be shown, and even the worship, the lyrics are gonna be shown on the screen simultaneously. But for this week, we weren't sure if we were gonna be able to do that, so I've already made the outline for you.</p><p>So if you, you don't have to download it, you can look at it, and if you don't want to, it'll be on the screen anyway. And I've also made one for the children. Let me get the... So the one you have probably has a little bit more, you know, clip art on it, but I made this so that the children that you're worshipping with can also worship with you, and it's just basic outline for them to pay attention to the larger understanding.</p><p>The sermons are obviously gonna be geared more toward the adults, but hopefully if you have children who are a little bit older who can read, that they can follow along and answer some questions. And this will be helpful if you, after the service, if you want to take some time to discuss with your children about the content of the sermon, or at least the part that they understood, that you can use this as a guide.</p><p>And so for the adults, you probably won't be getting the outline. You'll be seeing it on the screen, but you might get like a basic outline. But for the children, I'm gonna do my best to get one of these out, maybe on Saturday night, so that you'll have something to work with with your children.</p><p>Okay? And if you have any questions on that, just email us or text us. And one other thing is, because we're going live, we're gonna, we're switching out the order of our worship a little bit. We're gonna actually start with the offering. Okay? So right after I'm done with the announcement, I'm gonna be praying for us in the offering.</p><p>So during the offering time, we're asking you to obviously go online. There's instructions there, whether through PayPal or Venmo, whatever avenues. And the reason why we're doing that is, we don't want our Sunday worship to kind of look like, you know, like a Bible study, where we just kind of go through the material and that's it.</p><p>We want to have Sunday worship. We want that to mimic our live worship as much as possible. And so even the time of giving, because that is an act of worship that we're giving to God, we're asking you to take some time to be intentional with that. And even Sunday worship, that you would approach it with the, with the honor that, that God is due.</p><p>That even though you are most likely sitting in your living rooms or bedrooms, or maybe in front of your computer on your desk, that there would be a sense of reverence toward what we're doing. That you'd be intentional with your family to sit together. And again, just follow along as we do, like you would do on Sunday, except you'll be at home.</p><p>Okay? And whatever that may entail in your household, we're asking you to follow along with that. Okay? Alright, so if I have any other announcements, we'll let you know as time goes. But again, let me pray for us, and then we're going to give you maybe about 15, 20 seconds to do the PayPal.</p><p>And then our worship team will come in and they'll lead us. Okay? Let's pray. Gracious and loving Father, we, even in this situation, we praise you and thank you. You are a God who truly deserves all our worship, all our attention. I pray for our Berean families who are scattered, and in our own homes, in our various places, Lord God, where we are worshiping you.</p><p>We also pray for the guests who have come and are participating in this worship, that your Holy Spirit, through your word, would speak to us, that our worship that we give to you, whether we are physically together or apart, would truly be in spirit and in truth. We pray for the leadership of this country, that you would give them much wisdom.</p><p>Help them, Lord God, to be united together. Republicans, Democrats, Senate, Congress, whatever positions that people may be in, I pray, Father God, that they may be able to make decisions that are ultimately for the good of the country and good of this world. We pray for our health workers, Lord God, who are on the front line, who are being exposed to the virus day to day.</p><p>I pray for calm hearts. I pray that you would remind them, Lord God, that you are a sovereign God in control. I pray that you would protect them. I pray, Father God, that you give them opportunity to shine Christ in the hope that we have in Him. We pray that what we are doing here online, Lord God, would not diminish our worship that we give to you.</p><p>And even this offering that we give, help us to give it with a reverent heart. It may be multiplied for your use. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
