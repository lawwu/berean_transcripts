started, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=178s">00:02:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is doing some support work out in India.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=180s">00:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've announced to you when we came back from India in February that we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=186s">00:03:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to get behind them, we're going to help them build a training center for the pastors, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=192s">00:03:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where

40 pastors that gather together in a tiny room and probably could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=198s">00:03:18.600</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=202s">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the only place that they can meet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=204s">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're actually building a training center with the two other churches, with BMC and</span></div><div

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=214s">00:03:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">property, and then they're going to start building pretty soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=217s">00:03:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I may have to fly over there to kind of, again, assist with the funding and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=222s">00:03:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=223s">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you guys know, the work out in India is very interesting, because there's persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=228s">00:03:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is ramping up, and so the work that they're doing, they really require our prayers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=234s">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that hopefully we're not just watching from a distance, especially those who went with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=237s">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">us, that you remember the pastors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=240s">00:04:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, as you guys know, last time we went, the two of the pastors were beaten up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=245s">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was interesting or challenging to me was, we were all obviously very, very shocked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=252s">00:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because the pastors literally got beaten up right in front of us, but after it was all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=256s">00:04:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">done, we were concerned for them, and the simple response that they gave us was, "We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=261s">00:04:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">used to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=262s">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They're used to this pressure."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=264s">00:04:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were the ones shaking up, and they were just kind of like, "Yeah, this, obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=269s">00:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not fun, but every once in a while something like this does happen."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=273s">00:04:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ministry that's happening there, again, even though we're just doing support work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=277s">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is extremely important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=280s">00:04:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been out to India probably about six times now, and especially in the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=285s">00:04:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and even now, there's certain things that I need to adjust to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=289s">00:04:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that I need to adjust to is, every time, some of you guys know or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=293s">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">been to India, when they agree or disagree, they usually just kind of shake their heads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=299s">00:04:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sideways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=300s">00:05:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We usually do this by going, "Yes" or "No," but they shake their heads sideways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=304s">00:05:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very confusing because we don't do that here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=308s">00:05:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're used to shaking our heads this way, and they do it exactly the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=311s">00:05:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember the first or second time that I was there in India, and I would do some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=316s">00:05:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">training in how to study the Bible, and then I would say, "Yes, do you agree?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=321s">00:05:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they would sit there and go like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=322s">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=325s">00:05:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So after the class, I pulled one of the pastors aside saying, "When you say this, what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=331s">00:05:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=332s">00:05:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that mean yes or no?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=334s">00:05:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "Okay."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=338s">00:05:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So okay what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just means okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=343s">00:05:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that still doesn't help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=346s">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you go like this and you say, "Okay," is that a positive or negative?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/222397349#t=351s">00:05:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, "It could mean both."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
