Not only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=27s">00:00:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">will he be a king that he rules, but it says that when he comes that he would be our hiding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=31s">00:00:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">place and our refuge. So he, again, is presented to us as a savior. Chapter 33 mainly is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=38s">00:00:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Assyria. And again, it's not 100%, but most people believe that the historical context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=45s">00:00:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">behind chapter 33 is in reference to Assyria's domination over that area. And again, if that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=53s">00:00:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the case, King Hezekiah is the king behind it. And it gives a description about his wrath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=59s">00:00:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">against Assyria once the judgment is finished. So let's go into the text. Okay. So Thursday's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=68s">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">first question is in verse 3, write it in your own words. In verse 3 it says, "Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=74s">00:01:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the eyes of those who see will not be closed and the ears of those who hear will give attention."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=81s">00:01:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing, again, it says, "Once our eyes have been enlightened, we can never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=87s">00:01:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">go back." Meaning, closely related to the second doctrine, the perseverance of the saints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=93s">00:01:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And to clarify, the perseverance of the saints is not in reference to that if you work hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=99s">00:01:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you persevere, then you're going to somehow earn your salvation. The doctrine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=103s">00:01:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of perseverance of saints means that once your eyes have been opened, you can't choose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=109s">00:01:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to close your eyes. Kind of like a child, when he grows up and he recognizes that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=114s">00:01:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">naked, you can never go back once those eyes are open. So in the same way, those people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=119s">00:01:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, if they genuinely have seen it, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=124s">00:02:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">won't go back. And that's basically what that means. And in 1 John it also says that those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=129s">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">people who backslide left because they were never really of us. And if they were really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=134s">00:02:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of us, they would have never left. So leaving proved that their eyes were never truly open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=139s">00:02:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what he's saying in verse 3. And then along with that, the third part of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=143s">00:02:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Truth will clearly be understood and be clearly spoken." So again, everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=150s">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we know about God was from a distance according to Corinthians. But when the true King comes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=156s">00:02:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that His truth is going to be clearly understood. And because we clearly understand it, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=160s">00:02:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">able to clearly communicate it. The second section, all of it, we'll just put it up all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=168s">00:02:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at once. "Who are the fools and scoundrels?" referring to in verse 5 through 8. "A, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=176s">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">fool is a nation of the false leaders that people ran to in times of trouble." So during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=181s">00:03:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this period where there was a lot of foolish counsel toward Hezekiah and to the nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=185s">00:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of Israel, saying that just give in to Assyria or make amends with other nations. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=191s">00:03:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what it's saying is God's going to prove them all wrong. "B, they will no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=196s">00:03:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">longer be honored when the true King is revealed and His princes rule." So when Jesus finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=202s">00:03:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">shows up, they're going to be able to distinguish between who is right and who is wrong. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=206s">00:03:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">those people who are honored, the false prophets, the false leaders, they're going to be proven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=211s">00:03:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to be wrong and they will no longer be honored. "C, the fool only speaks folly because his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=217s">00:03:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">heart is filled with folly." And okay, so how do we get here? "And his foolishness is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=222s">00:03:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not by chance but by plan." See in verse 6 it says, "For the fool speaks folly and his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=228s">00:03:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">heart is busy with iniquity to practice ungodliness." So it's not something that he just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=234s">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">does instinctively, it just, it says that he's actually planning, he devises it in his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=238s">00:03:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">heart. "They practice ungodliness." "D, E, they utter error concerning the Lord." In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=245s">00:04:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">other words, they are false teachers. "F, because they're false teachers, the truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're disseminating does not feed the people. And they do not provide drink for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=256s">00:04:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the thirsty." And the ultimate reason why is because their motive is false. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=263s">00:04:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not leading because they're trying to shepherd the people and really care for the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=267s">00:04:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Ultimately, their motive is selfishly motivated. And that's exactly what Paul says in the New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=271s">00:04:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament. He says, "When they come, they will devour you." Because their goal is ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=276s">00:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for their own benefit. And so that's how Isaiah describes these false leaders as people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are being honored because the true king has not come. But when the true king comes, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=287s">00:04:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "The truth is going to be revealed who is and who is not." What is the spiritual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=297s">00:04:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">condition of the woman judged in verse 9? He said, "They are at ease and are complacent."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=305s">00:05:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a description of the condition of the nation of Israel. Again, we mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=310s">00:05:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this before, that the judgment of Israel is coming in a period of time when there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=315s">00:05:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of temple worship. For the most part, they were enjoying peace. They had money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=321s">00:05:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that everything was perfect, but they had freedom to worship. But they became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=328s">00:05:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">complacent over and over again. God wars the nation of Israel. That period of danger in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=336s">00:05:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the nation of Israel is not when they're being attacked, is not when they're being judged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=340s">00:05:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's when things seem to be going okay. There's no sense of urgency. There's no persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=345s">00:05:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">going on. That they become complacent and satisfied. And you'll notice that their complacency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=351s">00:05:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">is the beginning of all this folly. So the scripture says that once God fed them, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=356s">00:05:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">became proud. And once they became proud, they forgot God. And once they forget God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=362s">00:06:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and become complacent, that's when all this other trouble comes into the nation of Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=366s">00:06:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other stuff that we're going to be looking at is directly linked to the complacency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=371s">00:06:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of the nation of Israel. They're called in verse 11 to strip and to make themselves bare,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=379s">00:06:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning to put away the superficial adorning that they are proud of. And again, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=385s">00:06:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">indicative of a period in Israel's history, and it's also relevant to any culture where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=391s">00:06:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">they have excess money, they have excess time, excess freedom. And instead of using that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=397s">00:06:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to pursue God, they're spending a lot of time in frivolous stuff. So what God is calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=403s">00:06:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the nation of Israel to do in their complacency is to strip away, to bear, to take all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=409s">00:06:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">things out so that they may put their priorities straight. So what resulted in the exultant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=417s">00:06:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">city because of their complacency, and again, all related to a lukewarmness toward God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=425s">00:07:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">God calls them to beat your breasts for the pleasant fields. Now, on the surface, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=429s">00:07:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">does that mean? You may just read that and just kind of, you know, one of those things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=432s">00:07:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that we don't understand. But the meaning is to give attention to giving of life. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=441s">00:07:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">means to give attention to the giving of life. To give life to the people who are growing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=447s">00:07:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">up in Thorn's empire. So in other words, the imagery is of a mother who is breastfeeding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=452s">00:07:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and instead of using her breasts and the breast milk to feed the nation, she again, is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=459s">00:07:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">using it properly. So basically, this imagery is, again, it's not just a rebuke to women,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=465s">00:07:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">even though it says to complacent women, it is to the whole nation of Israel. That the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=470s">00:07:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">resources that God has given for the purpose of life is being squandered for other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=474s">00:07:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as a result of that, He says the city has been forsaken. So all of this happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=483s">00:08:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">simply because of complacency. And so, this is what's happening in the nation of Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=489s">00:08:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is a warning to all generations that, you know, we may think in comparison</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=497s">00:08:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to all the other vices and sins, that complacency just kind of seems like maybe even a part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=502s">00:08:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of what it means to be a Christian.

Because complacency is the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=518s">00:08:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of all other sins. Because once we become proud, and once we begin to think that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=525s">00:08:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">not desperate for God, all the other sins begin to creep in. And that's basically what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=529s">00:08:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He's saying to the nation of Israel. And what would call the wilderness to become fruitful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=537s">00:08:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Eventually, if this is going to be turned around, what has to happen? He says, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=543s">00:09:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the Spirit comes, when the Spirit is poured out on high, He says the revival is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=547s">00:09:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to come. And that's exactly what the Scripture says. In the end times, God's going to pour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=552s">00:09:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">out His Spirit, the young men will see visions, and old men will prophesy. So in other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=560s">00:09:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">revival is not simply an effort of man.

So when we sense complacency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=574s">00:09:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">when we sense that maybe we're going down the wrong path, first and foremost, God calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=579s">00:09:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">us to Himself. That we need to pray and to cry out, because only when the Holy Spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=585s">00:09:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is engaged is there true revival. So when the Holy Spirit comes and says the wilderness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=591s">00:09:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">will become fruitful again, again when you think of wilderness, you think of barrenness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=596s">00:09:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">or judgment, and you say, but God is going to turn that around, that there may be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=601s">00:10:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">fruit, and there may be peace, quietness, and righteousness. In other words, God's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=608s">00:10:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to intervene, and all the judgment of God that was coming because of complacency is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=613s">00:10:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be returned.

Isaiah's prophecy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=659s">00:10:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is, uses the particular historical event as a springboard to talk about and prophesy about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=667s">00:11:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the last days, about the coming of Christ. So even though there's enough evidence for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=671s">00:11:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">us to say, "Hey, this is talking about Assyria," ultimately, it is talking about the end times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=678s">00:11:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "Those who destroy will be destroyed."

That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=857s">00:14:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a source of our treasure.

So to describe the characteristics of those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=992s">00:16:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">are able to dwell in Zion, so in contrast to those who are being judged, those remnants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=999s">00:16:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that God will restore, He said, one, they will walk righteously and speak uprightly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1005s">00:16:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You notice that whenever we talk about righteousness, that speech always comes along with it, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1011s">00:16:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">as we mentioned before, it's because Jesus said it's what comes out of a man. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1016s">00:16:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about righteous walk and upright speech, He's talking about a man who's not only righteous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1021s">00:17:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">externally, but someone who's righteous internally, that the Holy Spirit has genuinely regenerated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1027s">00:17:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that person. He despises the gain of oppression. In other words, His selfish desire to advance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1036s">00:17:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Himself and to use any means, He said He despises that. To shake His hand lest they hold a bribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1044s">00:17:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, what He holds, He holds loosely. A bribe is something that you are willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1050s">00:17:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to have and cut corners and cheat because you want something so desperately that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1055s">00:17:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to cheat, lie, and do whatever you need to do. So to say that He shakes His hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1061s">00:17:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">lest they hold a bribe, in other words, He's always shaking it. He's not holding onto anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1066s">00:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">too tightly. He stops His ear from hearing bloodshed, that He refuses to engage even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1074s">00:17:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the planning and talk of evil, and then He shuts His eyes from looking on evil. He actively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1080s">00:18:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">avoids what is wrong. So He said, these are the characteristics of an individual, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1086s">00:18:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">simply somebody who's achieved righteousness, but somebody who's been regenerated. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1091s">00:18:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">not a description of an A student in the church. This is a description of somebody who's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1097s">00:18:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">deeply affected by the cross. And so His righteousness is not simply externally, it is internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1104s">00:18:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That His glory and His self-gain is not something that He seeks. He doesn't want bribes. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1112s">00:18:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">avoids evil. He actively pursues righteousness. What will the righteous see? Again, that term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1122s">00:18:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">see is repeated over and over again when restoration happens, when salvation happens, as we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1129s">00:18:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. When Christ comes and all that God intended is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1134s">00:18:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">restored, we see, just like we were talking about on Sunday, that our life comes when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1138s">00:18:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we see Zoe in Christ, and that we want that and we follow Him. And so we trade our life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1145s">00:19:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for His life, right? And so, first thing they see is that we will be whole. We will see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1150s">00:19:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the King in His full beauty. And that's what's going to change us in the end. That we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1158s">00:19:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">not going to be in heaven thinking like, "Ah, I don't want this, the worship is boring."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1161s">00:19:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we see His true beauty, we will be changed. They will see a land that stretches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1170s">00:19:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">afar. In other words, he's talking about peace, right? When you see a land just kind of going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1174s">00:19:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">on and on and on, there's no turmoil there. They will not see the insolent people and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1180s">00:19:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">strange speech. In other words, these enemies will not be in their land and there will not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1186s">00:19:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">be war. There will be peace in the land. How is Zion described in verses 20-24? It is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1202s">00:20:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">untroubled habitation, an immovable tent. In other words, it is permanent. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1209s">00:20:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is not just a temporary period. When Christ comes and He establishes His Kingdom, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1213s">00:20:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">there is nothing beyond that. That once He comes, that habitation is going to be permanent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1219s">00:20:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That when the Lord comes, it will be like a broad river for us by His presence. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1224s">00:20:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture describes river as a place of life, right? A blessed man is like a tree planted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1230s">00:20:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">by the rivers of waters because there is resource of life constantly sustaining and causing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1235s">00:20:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this tree to bear fruit. And so the description of the end times when Christ comes and establishes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1241s">00:20:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">His Kingdom is like He Himself is going to be like a broad river that we're all going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1246s">00:20:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to feed off of. And so just like He said to the Samaritan woman that He is the river,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1252s">00:20:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">He is the living water that whoever drinks of Him will never go thirst again and again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1256s">00:20:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's related to how this describes when He comes. That He will be the ultimate…</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1264s">00:21:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not working. Can you just press the button? Okay. He will be the ultimate judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1280s">00:21:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and the lawgiver. There will be no injustice in the land. Next D, no one will be sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1287s">00:21:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then E, the people will be forgiven of their sins. Now if you notice that all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1293s">00:21:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">promises that are made about the restoration of Zion, that there's going to be peace,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1299s">00:21:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to have life, that there's not going to be any sickness, we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1302s">00:21:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to be forgiven of sins. All of this because God is exalted. That we're going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1309s">00:21:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">His beauty, right? So again, as we wrap up at least this section of it, the focal point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1317s">00:21:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of salvation is God, is Jesus, is the Holy Spirit. John Piper wrote a book saying God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1324s">00:22:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is the gospel. He is the gospel. The gift of salvation isn't that through Him that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1330s">00:22:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He answers our prayers, that through Him we're going to have health, that through Him we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1333s">00:22:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have eternity and peace and safety. He said the ultimate gift is when we recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1339s">00:22:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that true beauty, true life is Christ Himself. And so we'll see again all these descriptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1348s">00:22:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why complacency is so dangerous. Complacency basically means that we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1354s">00:22:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily need Him. There's no sense of urgency to be with Him, to have intimacy with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1359s">00:22:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Him. So if everything that we desire is centered upon knowing Christ, seeing Christ, beholding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1367s">00:22:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">His beauty, beholding His glory, complacency basically is to hear that and say, "Eh, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1374s">00:22:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know if that's that important to you. Maybe for you, not for me." So again, we may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1379s">00:22:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">not think of complacency as such a dangerous sin, but it is the beginning of the slippage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1385s">00:23:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're no longer beholding the things of God. Complacency basically is not seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1390s">00:23:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">God, not being near God. And everything else that the scripture says happens as a result</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1397s">00:23:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of a proud heart that has become complacent. Okay. All right. So that's it for the study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1403s">00:23:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can take the rest of the time to discuss with your group. And there are instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1408s">00:23:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">about what to do for the next couple of weeks. Next week, we don't have Bible study. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1411s">00:23:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then the week after that, I will come back. And you're actually going to be studying or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1417s">00:23:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">reading all the way through chapter 39. So we're going to be covering all of that, at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1422s">00:23:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">least bits and pieces of it. You'll notice that the last four chapters, 39, 38, 37, 36,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1429s">00:23:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all very historical. So I'm having you guys read each chapter for each day. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1435s">00:23:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">then there's instructions there. There's only memory verses for one week. And then for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1440s">00:24:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">second week, I'm asking you to review all the other verses. Okay. So I've given some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1446s">00:24:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions to Brian about that. And then I've asked James Hong to kind of just oversee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/161042810#t=1454s">00:24:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the locking up and all this stuff.
