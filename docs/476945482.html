what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/476945482&t=213">00:03:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/476945482&t=214">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The majority of it is God warning year after year after year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

<span class="t">if you read the book of Revelation, it's pretty clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/476945482&t=318">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span
