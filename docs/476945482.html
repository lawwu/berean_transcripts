what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/476945482#t=213s">00:03:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/476945482#t=214s">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The majority of it is God warning year after year after year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
