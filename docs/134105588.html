you admonish people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105588#t=949s">00:15:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But on the other side of the spectrum, if you don't admonish people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/134105588#t=952s">00:15:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then you're also not heeding what God has
