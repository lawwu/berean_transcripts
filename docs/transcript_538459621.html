Today I have the privilege to share my testimony. I was born and raised in Taiwan for 14 years and I did not hear about the story of Jesus not until I was a second grader.</p><p>One time my mom's friend invited her and my family to her church and that was my first time being exposed to a Christian community. I did not seem to like the community at first because I did not understand why people were so serious and were worshipping this God who they call Abba Father.</p><p>I would not, I would only go to church for Sunday schools to hear interesting Bible stories and enjoy yummy candies. As I stayed with the church longer I saw something different among the people who are called Christians. They were extremely kind and loving towards others, making me curious and wanting to know who this God is and what makes them this way.</p><p>When I was still in Taiwan I feel ashamed when people ask me if I went to church. I think about moving to the United States where Christianity is the main religion excited me. Moving to the US as a freshman in high school I had so much love for this Christ who I did not know really well but was excited to know and I was also excited to be a part of a church family.</p><p>I attended my own church and was convinced that I was a Christian with my shallow knowledge of God and was baptized in December 2015. Right now looking back I do not believe that I was saved. When people ask me I would tell them that I'm Christian but in real life I only attended church occasionally and lived life for myself like the rest of the world.</p><p>I did not know who this God really is and did not have a personal relationship with him. All I knew about the gospel was only half true that God loves me and that's all. And I continued to go after the world and put my hope in all temporary worldly desires.</p><p>In December 2018 during my senior year of high school I went into a three month period of depression without telling anyone. I lost hope, cried to sleep every day and did not know how to ask for help. One night while I was crying to sleep and at the lowest point thinking about death I hear the voice from above God say to me, "Jen I love you." It was a heartwarming and touching experience.</p><p>That was my first time hearing the voice of God and I prayed to God and surrendered my life to him for help right after. Immediately God opened my heart the next day and I finally shared my thoughts and what I was going through with one of my close friends who also happened to be a Christian.</p><p>She encouraged me and prayed for me. This made me hungry and thirst to learn more about Christianity and the love of God. Coming into UCI I was hoping to find a Christian community where I could grow spiritually and learn more about this God. By the grace of God I was introduced to Berean Community Church during my second quarter at UCI.</p><p>I saw a group of genuine believers who lived their lives glorifying to God. I was encouraged and rebuked at the same time after learning more about the biblical truth and getting to know these godly individuals and seeing how humble they are recognizing their own weaknesses and sin and repent.</p><p>For the very first time I learned the complete version of the gospel. In Romans 5, 8, but God demonstrate his own love towards us. In that while we were yes sinners God, Christ died for us. This was also the first time I learned about the importance of devotion and prayer and had started to take these steps for my spiritual growth.</p><p>Going into quarantine was a challenge to my still growing faith. I was hopeless about the uncertainty and felt discontent not being able to see people in person. Through the Bible study on the book of Philippians and first Corinthians I learned that the Lord is the only source of joy, hope, and peace and everything else in this world is just material and will one day fade away.</p><p>Through the Holy Spirit my eyes were opened and led me to genuine surrender and repentance. Ever since then my joy and contentment are only found in Christ and Christ alone and I'm able to recognize the godly within versus the worthy within. Throughout my life there are so many ups and downs but I know that these are all God's grace.</p><p>I'm super thankful that God prunes me and reveals my sinfulness and pride through them all to make me come to an understanding of how my life is truly about. He always closes doors and opens even better ones for me. I once was lost but now I'm found. I once was a slave to sin but it was only through the blood of Christ my sins are forgiven and an eternal life was given.</p><p>I will still sin in the future but I will not destined grow to be a hobbit. I will strive to kill sin and pursue a life of holiness. It is no longer who I live but Christ who lives in me. I want to know God more and make him known.</p><p>Thank you. >> >> >> >></p></div></body></html>
