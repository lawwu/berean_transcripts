Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have. We pray, Father, that the study of your Word would open our eyes, help us to have a deeper understanding of your grace in our lives, and that we may be affected and that we may apply all that you have given us.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, Amen. Alright, so if you look at your first sheet, and just like I did last week, I'm going to start out with a principle of hermeneutics. One of the things that, again, I want to emphasize each week. And then the rest of it is for you to fill out as we go through the passage.</p><p>So again, if you want to make notes, the Bible verses are written down for you on the next page. And I'm hoping that you'll take notes here. And then the more organized notes on this one. Okay, so on this one it'll kind of give you an outline and I just left it blank.</p><p>So what I write down on this, you may want to write down on this because this is something that you'll probably hold on to. But I also gave you this because I want you to see where we're getting at. I don't want you to just say, you know, look at verse two and three and then I just write it down.</p><p>So I want you to see where we're getting at. Again, the goal of this study is not for me to just tell you what it means. It's for you to go and get in the habit of studying the Bible for yourself. Okay. All right, so if you look at the first page, the first principle that we want to look at, Scripture must interpret Scripture.</p><p>God does not contradict himself. Though the Bible was written in the span of 1500 years through 45 different human authors, the true author was God through the Holy Spirit. Therefore we must interpret each letter in light of the context of the whole of Scripture. So basically what it means is God is not going to say something that he said otherwise in another text.</p><p>So if you're interpreting a passage and it contradicts something that was already stated in Scripture, most likely your interpretation is not correct. Right? It's just like, again, this is not unique to the Bible. This is, if you're having a conversation and you know, in the same conversation, if he said, I love apples, I hate apples, you know, then you say, okay, I must've heard something wrong or he meant, he must've meant hated apples in some other context.</p><p>Right? So in Scripture, we have to understand that the author is the Holy Spirit. He used the agents of human beings, but ultimate author author is one person, the Holy Spirit. Right? And so therefore what he says in another text is not going to contradict what he says in, let's say, you know, in Hebrews, he's not going to contradict what he says in James or in Galatians.</p><p>So that's what it means by allowing Scripture to interpret Scripture. One of the reasons why I always quote cross references, whether it's my preaching or in Bible study, is because, is for that reason. So you can see that the interpretation of that passage is consistent with rest of Scripture.</p><p>So you're not just seeing, it's like, well, this is what it says. And we're just pulling meaning out of that, that you need to be in the habit of, if this is what it means, he must've said it somewhere else. In fact, oftentimes looking at other passages will help you to understand what he's saying here, because it's in the larger context of what he means.</p><p>You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So how this is applied in this particular text is in verse 24. So if you look at verse 24, it says, now I rejoice in the suffering for my sake and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction.</p><p>So if you looked at that outside of any other context and just looked at that verse alone, what could you say of this? Which would be outright heresy. Apostle Paul is contributing to our atonement. Yes? Okay, you guys are all looking at me like you have no idea what I'm talking about.</p><p>Verse 24, right? If you were to interpret that, if you're not paying attention, you look at that verse and you say, well, clearly scripture said, you're quoting the passage, right? There's a verse, there's a line where Paul says, I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction. So there's a part of what Jesus did on the cross wasn't complete.</p><p>So therefore Paul is fulfilling a necessary part of the atonement. Is that what Paul means? Clearly that's not what Paul means. Because Paul says clearly in other passages that that is not the case. So that's what it means by allowing scripture to interpret scripture. If you have detailed conversation with cults, this is where they go wrong.</p><p>So as a young Christian, if you talk to a Jehovah Witness, they'll quote verses and they'll tell you, well, clearly Jesus said this and they said this and Jesus is a God, not the God. And they'll have plenty of verses to back it up. Right? But they're taking it out of context.</p><p>And that's where bad doctrine comes from. So if this is cannot mean what it could because it clearly contradicts rest of scripture. There's a few verses I want you to look up. John chapter 14 verse 4 and John chapter 536. So if I can have somebody read out loud John chapter 17 verse 4, one of the guys tables can read that.</p><p>And then John 536, one of the ladies tables can read that. Okay. And I'm just going to point to somebody. Isaac usually my go to guy here. So he's pretty quick looking at passages. John 17, 4, if you can look at it real quick. 17, 4. Does it look wrong?</p><p>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that is the verse. Okay. And then denies John 536 over there. Okay. Okay. I could have obviously picked, you know, tons of and dozens of other passages to refer to his atonement being uniquely Jesus's fulfilled work. When Jesus was crucified on the cross, he says it is finished.</p><p>And again, you know, I'm not going to go into that doctrine here, but clearly the New Testament teaches that Christ's work on the cross is final and complete. There's nothing lacking. So what does Paul mean here when he says what is lacking in his affliction? So if you can look with me to Philippians chapter 230, we get an example, at least language wise, because it's the same author writing Colossians writing Philippians chapter 230.</p><p>If I can have a one of the guys read that. Johnny Wang, if you can read Philippians 230 for me. And then Samantha, if you can read Romans 10, 14. Okay. So Paul uses, again, he's not talking about Christ's atonement, but he uses a very similar language talking about how he was completing what was lacking in his service.</p><p>So again, the language is the same. He's saying that something that Paul was doing that he needed help in, and he talks about that in the context of, again, lacking. Romans chapter 10, 14, and I think you guys know that passage well. Okay. So that passage is talking about how Christ fulfilled his work on the cross, but he says how will this become effective if they do not hear?</p><p>And how will they hear if they are not sent? So he's talking about there's a gap between what Christ has done and the evangelization, right? And making of disciples. So Paul says we need to send people to bridge that gap. Like we need to go. So what is the best interpretation of this?</p><p>In light of everything else that we see. Paul is bridging the gap between his finished work on the cross and evangelizing and getting the word out. And if you read the context of the text that we're looking at, that's exactly what he's talking about. His own ministry of the gospel.</p><p>Right? So he's not talking about atonement. That he's bridging the gap, what is lacking in atonement. He's saying in evangelizing to get the word out. You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So if we get this wrong, this is where bad doctrine comes from. And this is why so many Christians are intimidated to talk to cult members because they quote passages.</p><p>And most Christians are not aware of the passage that they're quoting is out of context. Right? And so it's very, very important that when you are studying the scripture that you know not only what that verse says, but the context in which it is said. That's why even memorizing scripture, you know, I've had so many scripture verses that I memorized out of context.</p><p>And years later as I was studying the Bible, what I thought it said was completely different when I began to study it. Right? Like, there's still value in studying, I mean, memorizing scripture topically. But it's equally important, maybe even more important that you understand the context in which that verse came out of.</p><p>Or else that's where bad doctrine typically comes from. Okay? So that's one of the principles that I hope you remember. That's why cross references is always important. Especially early on in studying the Bible. If you're studying the scriptures and you say, wow, this is a great revelation. Make sure you double check with other cross references that is consistent with what he said in other passages.</p><p>Okay? All right. Let's jump in. As I did last week and the previous weeks, I divided the text into an outline. And that's why I kind of divided the way I did. I saw, again, number two in the outline that I gave you, outline of this passage in three parts.</p><p>Verse 21 to 23, it gives our past, present, and future standing before God. So before we jump into the text, to get a broad outline of his flow of thought. So that you're going to, when you're studying the word or you're studying the sentence or you're studying the paragraph, you understand what he is saying before and what he's saying after.</p><p>Right? To always understand it in context. So he starts out, at least in this text, about our past, present, and future standing before God, 24 to 27, Paul's calling to the gospel ministry. And then thirdly, verse 28 to 29, Paul's work in the gospel ministry. How is God accomplishing this work through Paul?</p><p>Verse 28 through 29. Okay. That's already written for you, so you don't need to write all that. All right. So the first section, I said past, present, and future. So if you look at verse 21, again, none of this is something that you have to go to the commentary for.</p><p>If you spent enough time in front of this text, you can gain these insights for yourself. Okay? So if you look at the first three verses, you can clearly see that there is a past component of the first verse. Right? He says, "Although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds." And then the present, "But now, he has now reconciled you through his fleshly body and to present you blameless." And then the future is called to persevere, to continue to go forward.</p><p>Right? So in the first section, verse 21, 22, and 23, past, present, and future of where we stand before God. Right? Remember one of the things that I asked you to do when you're looking for observations, that see if you see any contrasting ideas. Do you see any in this section?</p><p>How do you see it? Okay. Alienated and reconciled. Okay? Right? Before we were alienated, now we're reconciled. Anything else? Hostile in mind. Okay, that's not the word I want to use. Hostile in mind. Right? Talking about the mind being hostile, being reconciled in the flesh. Right? So if you look at the third part, "Engaged in the evil deeds, but presented as blameless." Right?</p><p>So he's talking about, so each one of these lines basically nullifies the other. Was reconciled, was alienated, but reconciled. Hostile in mind, but atoned in the flesh. Engaged in evil deeds, presented to be holy. Right? So I don't think it's by accident. Paul is basically systematically targeting, this is who you were, but what Jesus did nullifies and transferred you.</p><p>Right? And then the third verse, he points to the future where he says, "But if indeed you continue in the faith." So this is not passive. He's not saying, "This is what happened." That you just kind of enjoy yourself. He adds that if this is you, and it will be continued to be you, if you continue in the faith, firmly established, steadfast, and not moved away.</p><p>So all three of these words are basically saying the same thing. That you continue this path. You persevere. Right? You don't just hear it and say, "Oh, we're justified and that we're just waiting to get to heaven." He talks about sanctification and the idea of persevering is staying steadfast.</p><p>How do we stay steadfast? In faith, from the hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Right? Staying grounded in the hope. So one of the questions that I asked in your discussion question is, if our justification, he says, will carry us on to completion if we hold fast to our confession in faith.</p><p>Right? And remain steadfast. So these aren't just passive, where you're just kind of on the boat and you're just floating. And that's the problem with the Hebrews. Right? The recipient of Hebrews was they got on the boat and they're just drifting. But here he says to hold fast. Right?</p><p>In faith. Okay? So past, present, and future. The second part, verse 23, 24 to 27, talking about Paul's ministry. So, there's five things that I observed about Paul's ministry. One, he says he rejoiced in the suffering for your sake. One of the questions that came up when he says, "When he reconciled." What verse was that?</p><p>Yeah, verse 22. Yeah, he is clearly referring to Christ because he's talking about how he reconciled in his body. Okay? That was one of the questions that came in. All right. So the five things that I noticed in verse 24 through 27 about Paul's ministry is that Paul considered his suffering a joy.</p><p>Okay? Now, an average person, you know, it's like, "Well, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ. There's a special anointing in him. And he says that." But how many times do you see a Christian, like, actually saying, "I'm suffering for your sake and I rejoice over it." Right? If somebody said that, we would almost be cynical thinking you're fake.</p><p>Like, be real. Tell me how you really feel. Right? Now, we would never accuse Apostle Paul of that because he's an apostle. But I think that's directly linked to what he said previously. If his hope is firmly grounded in Christ, yes, his suffering is leading to greater glory. And it's because of his great faith he's able to see it in joy.</p><p>Right? But if your hope is laid up here, how can suffering be rejoicing? It's only when you see suffering as a way of greater glory. Right? And if you believe that. So, one, he says his suffering. And then, what suffering is he talking about here? What context is he writing this letter?</p><p>Remember? Huh? He's a prisoner. So, this is one of the prisoner epistles. So, he's in Rome writing this letter. So, when he says he's suffering, everybody's aware where he is. Right? And then he says, number two, his work for the church. And in my flesh I do my share on behalf of the body.</p><p>And then third, in work for Christ. And then fourth, that God gave him this stewardship. He's rejoicing. He's doing his part for the church. He's doing his part for the gospel. And spreading the gospel. Fourth, he says he was appointed by God. And fifthly, he's talking about the message itself.</p><p>Right? Is a mystery. So, when he says God appointed him to be able to fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, he says the full, the preaching of the word of God is making the mystery known. Like that's God's will. Right? What was hidden, now they know.</p><p>But there's so much more to be revealed. Even now. Right? How many of you, and again this is a rhetorical question, have been Christians more than ten years and did not make the connection of Leviticus to the New Testament? Right? It's a rhetorical question. You don't have to answer.</p><p>My guess is most of you didn't. Right? Because it's just not taught. But those of you who made the connection, now look back at it. How important, how important is Leviticus in understanding the gospel? Crucial. Right? Now how many Christians in our, you know, in our area or around the world do you think understand that connection between what God was doing in Leviticus in understanding the depth of the gospel?</p><p>Right? Very few. So, Paul says the preaching of the gospel is the mystery being revealed. And so he describes his preaching of the gospel as connecting the dots. What Christ has done and what God had done in the Old Testament. Right? And that was preaching of the gospel. So the preaching of the gospel isn't simply God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.</p><p>The gospel actually begins in the Old Testament. Right? Gospel doesn't start in Matthew chapter one. It starts in the beginning. All of it is the gospel. So when somebody says you know you got to preach the gospel and say God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.</p><p>That's, they're starting at the midpoint. Starting point is all of sin and fall short of the glory of God. Right? And what God was doing through all of that. Okay. So the third part, verse 28 through 29, Paul's work in the gospel ministry. I don't know if you can read my writing.</p><p>All right. So four things I saw. One, we proclaim him. So at the core of this mystery being revealed is Christ himself. Right? That's why you probably hear all the times that all of the Bible is about Christ. Because Christ is at the center of all of this. Not only is he the creator, not only is the sustainer, not only is he the goal, he's the mediator.</p><p>Right? He's the fulfiller. All of the Bible at the center of it is Christ. Right? So remember we talked about context. If you're interpreting a passage and you're preaching something and you don't know how to connect that to Christ, you probably didn't interpret that correctly. Okay? I give you an example about the book of Jonah.</p><p>Right? The point of that story is not don't mess with God or Wales is going to kill you. The end. What does that have to do with redemptive history? Not saying that there aren't principles where God teaches us how to behave. Like does the Bible teach us don't mess with God?</p><p>Yes. Does the Bible teach us that we need to rely on him? All of these things are true. But if the central message is Christ and you don't see any connection to Christ, you probably miss the bigger picture in that text. Right? So the central message of Jonah is God raised up the nation of Israel to be a light to the world.</p><p>Right? And he was self-focused. Israel only cared about Israel. God said from the very beginning that I'm going to bless you and through you many other nations are going to be blessed. But they completely forgot about that. So all of that in redemptive history. And the same thing with the church.</p><p>He said if we are the light and we lose the light, right? And we're for the salt of the world and we lose our saltiness. He said what good is it for? That's basically what was happening with the nation of Israel. Right? So number one, Paul's ministry was proclaiming Christ at the center.</p><p>Two, the work was admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom. So right off in Matthew chapter 28, right? Make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the father, son, and holy spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. So it's not like he's not simply saying God is awesome, he died for us, isn't he awesome, let's go to heaven.</p><p>Right? So Paul's preaching and preaching about Christ includes admonishing, teaching, rebuking, training in righteousness. Right? So that process of sanctification is part of what it means to put our hope in Christ. So that was also his preaching. So again, for whatever the reason in our modern era, preaching imperative has been dismissed as moralism.</p><p>Right? It's moralism if you don't connect that to Christ. But if you connect it to Christ, Christ will always call us to holiness. So you can't separate these two things. You can't separate the preaching of the gospel and then say imperatives are legalism. Because imperatives are part of the gospel.</p><p>Right? We no longer obey the law, but we obey the law of what? Christ. Right? So that's number two. Three, to present everyone, every man complete in Christ. Right? So he's not just teaching and he's not just training. His goal is to bring them to the end conclusion. So the word for complete here basically means to bring them to the logical end.</p><p>So the point of justification is to be reconciled so that they can go back to where God intended. That's what the word complete means. It doesn't mean complete perfect that somehow during this lifetime you're going to be complete. Right? You're never going to sin. You never have doubts. You never have, you know, you do anything wrong.</p><p>The word complete basically means to bring to completion. So in other words, God justifies us in order to sanctify us. Right? Those two things are not separate. So Paul's ministry preaching Christ, admonishing every man to bring him to the logical conclusion of their salvation. To make every man complete.</p><p>And then finally he says all of this by the power that's working within him. So it starts with him. Right? You can't be an effective minister at any capacity. Small group, one to one, college, singles, married, family. You can't be effective in any way if the work is not all first happening with you.</p><p>He says he's laboring according to the power which mightily works within me. So the primary and the most important thing that every Christian has to be is making sure that Christ is affecting you first. Because everything else that you do without Christ affecting you is just your labor is kicking against the goal.</p><p>Building something that you have no power to build. Bringing someone from darkness to light. You have no power to do that. It's only when the Holy Spirit is working in us and through us. And that's what Paul says. Okay? Right. So again, we can go deep into any one of these things, but again the goal of this is for you to see, again, if you spend enough time in front of the Bible and just ask questions, outlining, thinking, cross-referencing back and forth, that these are insights that any one of you can have.</p><p>Okay? And so my hope and prayer is that you would learn to do quiet time in this way. That you don't just skim through three chapters and say I did my quiet time. But sit there and dig. Because so much comes out when you take your time. Especially those of you guys who are memorizing the book of James.</p><p>Right? Even sometimes after you've memorized it, like years later you'll be thinking about it. Oh, that's what that meant. Right? Because you have it in your head, but you haven't really like, you didn't really dig. Right? So anytime you study the scripture, just take some time. All scripture is inspired by God.</p><p>Every part of it. Right? So you want to make sure like you understand. Just like if you're reading a love letter, you dissect every word, every sentence. Right? Every smiley face. What does this X mean? What does this O mean? Oh, it's kisses and hugs. Right? She put ten of them instead of three.</p><p>What does this mean? So just like you would study a love letter in depth, you would, you know what I mean? This is more important than a love letter. This is a redemptive letter from God himself. Right? So you can't say I want to know God and then not devote yourself to scripture.</p><p>Because he revealed himself through his word. So if you want to know God, you have to commit to study of the word. And it's different than me telling you how much God loves you versus you hearing it yourself from studying the word of God. Okay? All right. So next week's passage, Colossians 1, Colossians 2, 1 through 8.</p><p>And then the discussion questions are here from 1 through 4. And I'll let you guys get into your group. Okay? Let me pray first and then I'll dismiss you to your group. Heavenly Father, I pray for your blessing upon our small group time. And I know that many brothers here and sisters who've come from work and a long day, I pray that you would encourage and refresh their tired souls.</p><p>We pray that the discussion would be honest, open, and that we would learn to be vulnerable, Lord God, toward one another. But whatever it is that we pursue, we pursue Father God in spirit and in truth. And so I ask for your blessing. I ask for those who are facilitating that you would give them wisdom.</p><p>And so we ask for your blessing over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening.</p></div></body></html>
