And one of the things that we have been learning is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=121s">00:02:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by the ramification of what Christ has done for us individually, we together are one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=128s">00:02:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember that scripture talked about we are becoming one body, right? What's more, at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=135s">00:02:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the beginning of this chapter, there was such a description of, listen, we have one faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=140s">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">one baptism, one spirit, one Lord, right? And so it emphasized such a oneness for every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=145s">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">believer that is in Christ. At the same time, the scriptures emphasize our individuality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=152s">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the passage of the scriptures right before or earlier in this chapter talked about how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=157s">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to each of us, Christ has given gifts. And what's more, within that same context, says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=164s">00:02:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ has given gifts to the church to minister the scriptures. So we learned about how Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=170s">00:02:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">says he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=176s">00:02:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And he talked about how he did all this with the desire and a vision so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=180s">00:03:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we would grow to the stature of Christ. He's talking about our own maturity. That when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=186s">00:03:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you think about the growth of the church, we have to be thinking on the spiritual level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=190s">00:03:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to be growing in unity. We have to be growing in like-mindedness according to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=195s">00:03:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the word of God and so forth. But what's more, the vision of God for the church would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=200s">00:03:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that every single one of us be equipped, be matured in such a way that we are involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=206s">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in ministry, okay? That we are the ones taking hold of serving all this for the purpose of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=213s">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the building up of the body, that the church would build itself up in love. Okay? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=217s">00:03:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where we left off in the previous section. And then so it's not so separate, but that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=224s">00:03:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">moves on that all of these thoughts then contribute to these next verses that we were going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=229s">00:03:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">be studying tonight. So reminding us that the vision of God that he has for the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=236s">00:03:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is comprised of these kinds of things that we're responsible for. We have this passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=241s">00:04:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "So this I say and affirm together with the Lord that you walk no longer as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=246s">00:04:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=252s">00:04:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=256s">00:04:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hardness of their heart, that they, having become callous, have given themselves over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=268s">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">learn Christ in this way. If indeed you have heard him and have been taught in him, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=273s">00:04:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=278s">00:04:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=284s">00:04:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self, which is in the likeness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=290s">00:04:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, which sorry, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=295s">00:04:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness of the truth." Okay. What I'd like to do is just take a moment to look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=301s">00:05:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">passage and because it's a little bit long, truthfully, it'd have been nice, I think if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=305s">00:05:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was planning it more closely and thought about this passage to break this up because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=311s">00:05:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot in here. But what I'd like to do then, since it's a little bit of a longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=315s">00:05:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">passage, I'd like to outline it for you. And so therefore we're going to read it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=321s">00:05:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we read it again, we recognize distinct portions of this passage that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=326s">00:05:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to be emphasized. And typically it's the command. So verse 17 says, "So this I say and affirm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=333s">00:05:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">together with the Lord that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk." We should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=339s">00:05:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be underlying and underscoring that command that you are to walk no longer as the Gentiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=344s">00:05:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And if you notice all of the other portions of this passage here in this first section</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=351s">00:05:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up until the end of verse 19, it is all descriptions of a walk of the Gentiles. Okay. How are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=358s">00:05:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentiles like? And so it says that these Gentiles, they walk in the futility of their mind, being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=364s">00:06:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">darkened in understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=368s">00:06:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is in them, because of the hardness of their heart. And they, having become callous, have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=373s">00:06:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=379s">00:06:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's clear to see that all of those descriptions have its pointer and an indicator of the walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=388s">00:06:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Gentiles. And a second half of it clearly contrasts, but you, okay, you as an individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=395s">00:06:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">who is set apart from the Gentiles, you did not learn Christ in this way. If indeed you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=400s">00:06:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have heard of him and have been taught in him, just as truth is in Jesus. Notice how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=405s">00:06:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I indented that a little bit further because he takes a moment to do a check. He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=412s">00:06:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not true of you that you are just like the Gentiles. Rather, you didn't learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=416s">00:06:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ in this fashion, right? That's not you. If of course, indeed. And so he does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=421s">00:07:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that cross check and then he describes, he describes what it means to not walk like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=427s">00:07:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentiles, but rather, okay, the way that we have learned Christ is that we should be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=432s">00:07:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted and the accorded in accordance with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=437s">00:07:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the lust of the seat and that you being renewed in the spirit of your mind, put on the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=442s">00:07:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">self, which in the likeness of God has been created in Christ in righteousness and holiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=447s">00:07:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the truth. Okay. So that's a brief outline, how you can separate that passage into two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=453s">00:07:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sections. Let's begin by observing that first command. Essentially, he is calling us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=461s">00:07:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">cease and desist to stop from walking like the Gentiles. The old life needs to go, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=467s">00:07:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that scripture has described this command in so many different ways. Set yourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=472s">00:07:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">apart. Okay. Do not love the world or the things in the world, right? You're separated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=477s">00:07:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from this world. You need a book of Romans chapter six, you need to stop presenting yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=482s">00:08:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to unrighteousness, but present yourself in holiness and righteousness towards God. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=487s">00:08:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in so many different ways, the scripture has challenged us.

Did you guys know that May 6th was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1114s">00:18:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Sigmund Freud's birthday?

Now, the thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1127s">00:18:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it is for the thought of trying to assess a human being, he did have some really just as considering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1133s">00:18:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like one of the foundation laying individuals for psychology. He tried to assess what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1139s">00:18:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">basic driving motive for an individual, for a human being. And he essentially started talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1145s">00:19:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about we're doing exactly what gives us pleasure. From the age of an infant, a baby, we have erotic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1151s">00:19:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">desires. Basically, sex drive. The sex drive to a human being is the greatest motivator. What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1158s">00:19:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">very interesting is that he wrote that the sex drive for whether male or female is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1164s">00:19:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the greatest weakness in the person's life because this is also the prime objective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1169s">00:19:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. This is also the prime motivator and he described it as the prime common denominator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1176s">00:19:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">amongst us all. Okay. See, when you don't have God in the picture, that is actually a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1181s">00:19:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">good description. Even the apostle Paul would say, "You know what? If God doesn't exist, tomorrow we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1185s">00:19:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">die. Let's live it up." That's pretty much what King Solomon is saying in Ecclesiastes. "You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1190s">00:19:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what? If God doesn't exist under the sun, then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1195s">00:19:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">limit myself in terms of pleasure. So let's go at it." There's a rationale and reason when God's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1203s">00:20:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in the picture. And it all kind of makes sense. Why would you deprive yourself? Tomorrow we die,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1209s">00:20:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let's do it. But scripture says we know God. God, the one Lord, one God, one Father. He is our common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1218s">00:20:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">denominator, greatest source, greatest motivator. We know something better. Now, because we need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1225s">00:20:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">move on, let's do the second part of who the Gentiles are. And it says, "Because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1228s">00:20:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hardness of their heart, and they having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1234s">00:20:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for the practice of every kind of impurity and greediness." And what you realize is not only is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1240s">00:20:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he describing the mind of the Gentile, he's talking about the heart of the Gentile. And remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1245s">00:20:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when he's talking about Gentiles, he's not specifically pointing to the Gentile sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1249s">00:20:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Ephesians church. It's like that one guy, right? Gentiles, ethnic, that's just like everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1254s">00:20:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? It's anybody who's not a chosen person. It's anybody who's not part of the chosen nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1261s">00:21:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of God. So essentially, don't ever use the excuse like, "But everybody else does it." Because that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1268s">00:21:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the point, right? Stop thinking and wanting what everybody else wants. You're different. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1273s">00:21:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">point. Now, in taking a look at this and making observations, notice the descriptions that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1280s">00:21:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is, I highlighted in red, there is hardness, there is callousness, there is sensuality, impurity, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1288s">00:21:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">greed. Okay? And when you think about that, when you think about the first two terms, hardness and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1293s">00:21:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">callousness, we are describing and seeing somebody who is willfully resistant. Okay? So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1301s">00:21:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">always an issue of just not knowing. There is willful resistance. I have decided not to care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1307s">00:21:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be honest with you guys. That song, "Let It Go, Let It Go." I think I've mentioned this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1311s">00:21:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in a previous sermon before. "Let it go, let it go." A song that we just play over and over again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1318s">00:21:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">mindlessly. If you think about what she's saying, she's just not going to care what anybody else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1323s">00:22:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thinks. Now, yes, it's kind of like, "I get it." You know, people are judgy. People are, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1330s">00:22:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">critical. They make you feel like something's wrong with you and stuff like that. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1336s">00:22:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">buy into that, that's pretty dangerous. As a matter of fact, it'll make you so isolated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1341s">00:22:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Some kind of ice cold castle. Okay. Now, moving forward, think about callousness. How repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1348s">00:22:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">friction basically makes you desensitized. You know, what's really funny is I took the time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1355s">00:22:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look up callousness, how to prevent it in WebMD. And it says, "Well, because callousness comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1361s">00:22:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated injury and friction, please stop your activity." I think that's pretty funny. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1367s">00:22:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing about it is, brothers and sisters, beware. If you have this self-defensive mechanism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1374s">00:22:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where someone tries to talk to you and it's just like, "Wah," you know, "How dare you point the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1378s">00:22:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">finger at me?" It's difficult to talk to you because your pride comes out and you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1384s">00:23:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to listen and hear. Right? You don't like the way they said it. You're just not hearing them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1389s">00:23:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out because X, Y, and Z. Okay. That callousness is a real thing, meaning that that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1395s">00:23:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">self-defense mechanism, that rejection of truth or anybody's input, it doesn't just stay there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1401s">00:23:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It crusts and it hardens. Like the more you decide, "I'm not going to care," it doesn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1407s">00:23:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">stay there. It gets worse. Right? That's kind of like what the picture is describing there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1411s">00:23:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more, it says, "They've given themselves over to sensuality." Meaning that's like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1416s">00:23:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">conscious decision. That's like a willful, conscious decision that's saying, "I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1421s">00:23:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do this." Right? And I feel like that little phrase, like, "You know what? I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1426s">00:23:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do it." Beware. Right? No, no. You make your decisions based on careful consideration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1432s">00:23:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of what glorifies God. Okay? If your, "I'm just going to do this," means, "I'm just going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1438s">00:23:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this at the cost of my own preferences, at the cost of my own convenience and my comfort. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1442s">00:24:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to do it because it glorifies God. Good for you." But if you're sitting there thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1447s">00:24:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I don't know if I should do it because I don't know if God's going to be pleased. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1449s">00:24:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">know if I should do it because, and then people are going to be hurt. And then, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1453s">00:24:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to care about everybody else. I'm just going to care about myself." If you do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1456s">00:24:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">beware. Because that kind of decision-making is absolute absurdity and it opens you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1466s">00:24:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">every impurity. Now, one of the questions I asked in the Bible study was, "When you behave like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1471s">00:24:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentile, what are the consequences?" That's what I'm talking about. It's not explicit in the passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1476s">00:24:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you look at this passage, there are descriptors here. There are descriptions of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1482s">00:24:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">happens as you give yourselves over. There's a callousness that happens, but also it opens you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1487s">00:24:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">up to every kind of impurity because that kind of rationale, when someone says, "You know what? I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1492s">00:24:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know this is grossly wrong, but I almost feel like it's better to just do it at least once. So, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1497s">00:24:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know what it feels like and I can get over with it. And then I won't want it anymore." Lies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1503s">00:25:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolute lies. Your selfish heart, once it gets a little bit of thing, will want more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1508s">00:25:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more than that, it's going to open you up to every other kind of impurity because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1514s">00:25:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what that rationale does.

Scripture says there is sensuality, impurity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1521s">00:25:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and greediness in us that is growing and we have to kill it.

So, there is a foolishness of heart. I think I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1534s">00:25:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to give that to you earlier. I apologize. So, absolute foolishness of heart, which I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1538s">00:25:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">describing as a will, desire. There is a willingness to want this kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1547s">00:25:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there is a passage I want to point out for you guys because, oh sorry, there is a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1556s">00:25:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason why I want to mention that a little bit is because by observation, can we just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1561s">00:26:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to observe and observe and observe, but because one of the things that it says here is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1567s">00:26:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of the hardness of heart, that's why the previous stuff was going on. So, if you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1573s">00:26:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about it, okay, all these descriptions of the mind, it's all futile and darkened and excluded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1579s">00:26:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Notice how it says because, because of the hardness of the heart right at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1584s">00:26:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you think about that, you got to ask the question, what's the relationship between the mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1587s">00:26:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and the heart here? Now, what I would like to just simply say because I'm taking a lot of time on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1592s">00:26:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this is that sometimes the greatest cause of our irrationality, the greatest cause of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1599s">00:26:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">frustration in our minds, it's not because I don't have enough brain cells to work out my problems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1604s">00:26:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's because I have a stubborn will. That's why sometimes it's so difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1609s">00:26:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want need to sometimes overcomplicate why we do certain things. It's not always because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1615s">00:26:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know enough and I don't have the wisdom to make decisions. It's because the rationale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1620s">00:27:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">comes from the want. And that's why scripture says, "He who is able to control his heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1628s">00:27:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is mightier than those who control cities and reign over kingdoms." Because it's that hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1633s">00:27:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes. And so, I kind of think, take a moment to think about myself a little bit sometimes. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1639s">00:27:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I realize now that I'm, you know, I'm not old, but I'm not like super young either, right? 37,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1645s">00:27:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">just like right there in the middle of prime, I would like to say. Now, as I think about that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1652s">00:27:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sorry if anybody is watching this older than me, I hope you're not offended by what I just said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1657s">00:27:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Well, anyway, what I'm trying to say is sometimes I wish like the sins that I commit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1665s">00:27:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were like juvenile mistakes, but they're not. At this point, I've been a Christian since like 1998</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1673s">00:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and walking with the Lord. And it's not like I haven't read the scriptures, you know, like I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1679s">00:27:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't never knew that part of scripture, right? Like a lot of the sins that I'm committing now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1684s">00:28:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually creating the rationale to excuse it, right? Majority of the sins that I commit now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1691s">00:28:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are not going to be knee-jerk reactions because I happen to be the youthful guy who's never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1695s">00:28:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">experienced that temptation before. A lot of the sins that are coming up now are like temptations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1701s">00:28:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had. And so, I just want to highlight that because this call for us to not walk like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1708s">00:28:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Gentiles, if you were thinking like, I'm not perusing out there like, you know, out of Vegas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1716s">00:28:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">every night, like living in abject like licentiousness and just completely disrespecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1722s">00:28:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">God. But at the same time, there are elements and patterns that are very similar. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1728s">00:28:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what I'm getting at here. We have to be careful about those things. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1734s">00:28:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">For the sake of time, I'm going to pass this, but just cross-reference 1 Peter 4, 3-5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1739s">00:28:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">as another challenge to us, a prescription for us, instructional to let go of that which is Gentile,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1746s">00:29:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning our previous selves. And so, he turns the page and he says, "But instead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1750s">00:29:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you did not learn Christ this way, if indeed you heard of him and have been taught of him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1757s">00:29:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just as Jesus, sorry, Christ Jesus, well, just as truth is in Jesus." Okay. So, after believing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1767s">00:29:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">upon Christ and receiving all the blessings, Apostle Paul is saying, "So, you're different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1772s">00:29:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You didn't learn like them.

You didn't receive like them."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1778s">00:29:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more, he gives this kind of check again, which is, "If indeed you have heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1783s">00:29:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and been taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus Christ." And so, this is a huge challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1789s">00:29:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for us when we think about this.

You didn't learn Christ that way. And if you thought that some people who believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1856s">00:30:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, you need to accept Christ because he's going to then hear all your requests and he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1860s">00:31:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to fulfill the desires of your heart and we get to bargain with God in some way or another,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1864s">00:31:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">by giving him our worship and he's going to give us everything we will ever long for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=1868s">00:31:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you did not learn Christ that way.

Is it appropriate for believers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2024s">00:33:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to examine themselves based upon this idea, "Has God given me the spirit that I might be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2032s">00:33:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">even at least, bare minimum, you should be able to see that guy right there in my life?

No, God said, "I will glorify you." But God has given us that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2060s">00:34:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible, incredible illumination of the eyes to be able to tell the difference, be convicted of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2065s">00:34:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sin and righteousness. That's the spirit's work in us. And then to be able to say, "Those are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2069s">00:34:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things that needs to change." And so the next part of it, scripture says, "We need to learn to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2075s">00:34:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">off and put on." So I'm going to read this portion. It says, "That," okay, describing all of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2082s">00:34:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, "If indeed the spirit is in you, like the truth that is in Jesus is in you. If that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2087s">00:34:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">truth, the powerful truth is in you, then that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2093s">00:34:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lust of deceit. And that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2099s">00:34:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">renew to be renewed in the mind, sorry, renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2105s">00:35:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which in likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth." So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2113s">00:35:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">take a moment to think about this a little bit. And I would like to make some initial general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2117s">00:35:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">remarks, which is if you think about this idea, it's kind of like, I just, for the sake of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2126s">00:35:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">analogy, imagine you came to me and you said, "Pastor Mark, man, I really want to grow. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2132s">00:35:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it's been hard." Let's say you have a bout with your temper and anger. "I've just been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2139s">00:35:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">an angry man for days and days and days. When I say days, I mean years and years and years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2144s">00:35:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always been like this. And I want to grow so bad because it hurts so many people and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2149s">00:35:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right?" And then I tell you, you know what you got to do is you got to put that off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2154s">00:35:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to put on kindness. Okay? Right? Like, doesn't it sound kind of patronizing? Doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2161s">00:36:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it sound like overly simplistic? Okay. When I took a moment to just meditate and reflect on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2167s">00:36:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it does. It almost feels silly that the scriptures has to tell you, you have the spirit of God in you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2174s">00:36:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have the power. Now put off and put on. And essentially what I get is this picture. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2182s">00:36:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like I am my son, you know, the seven-year-old, nine-year-old son. And my parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2188s">00:36:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are telling me like, "Change your dirty shirt." Right? And that's fine. I was meditating and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2195s">00:36:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was like, "Huh, that sounds kind of patronizing." Right? But I'm over it. I'm like, "You know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2201s">00:36:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">though? I am a child. And you know what though? Although it's sad state of affairs, I have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2205s">00:36:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reminded how to take off my shirt and put it on." Now, for those of you guys who have children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2211s">00:36:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, as embarrassing as it may be, just simply the aspect of trying to get your son to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2217s">00:36:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like change his shirt, trying to get your child to change your shirt, it could be like the greatest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2221s">00:37:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">drama in history. Right? I mean, think about all the different excuses. You tell your son like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2226s">00:37:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, you gotta change your shirt because man, like there's like mud over it. You like spilled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2232s">00:37:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your milk and it smells like sour something." Right? And then your children all of a sudden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2237s">00:37:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with the most like masterful excuses. Like, "I don't have any shirts." Like, "What?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2241s">00:37:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I just bought your shirt the other day." Right? "I even put it on the floor for you." It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2247s">00:37:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, but this is my favorite shirt. I always wear this shirt. It's dirty and smells like rancid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2252s">00:37:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">milk." Right? It's like, "Do I have to do it right now? Do I have to go right now?" Right? "How am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2258s">00:37:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I going to just do it later?" Right? And then what's more like you send your child to the room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2264s">00:37:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're just like, "Change your shirt." And your kid's sitting there like, "I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2267s">00:37:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">look stupid." Right? "I'm just going to look silly." Like that's one of the favorite ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2270s">00:37:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, "It doesn't match my shorts," one said. Okay? And then you walk into the room to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2275s">00:37:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sure they're doing their job and they're sitting there with their shirts, not really putting it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2278s">00:37:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they fake like they're going to put it off, but instead they pull it up to their eyes and start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2281s">00:38:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">playing ninja with it. It's like, "Oh, look at me. I'm a ninja." Right? You're like, "What in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2285s">00:38:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">world? Just change your shirt." Okay? And then you grab the shirt and then you pull it out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2292s">00:38:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you say, "Right here. Change your shirt right now." Okay? Now, if your child is an infant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2298s">00:38:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to put the shirt on for them because they can't do it themselves. But if your child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2302s">00:38:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is of a certain age, you may be tempted to grab the shirt and forcefully just shove it over their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2308s">00:38:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">head. But I think God treats us like his children and recognizes, not recognizes, but he knows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2315s">00:38:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to learn how to change our shirts ourselves. He shouldn't be doing that stuff for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2320s">00:38:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">us. Right? I thought about that because, man, sometimes I hear people talk like, "You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2327s">00:38:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got this desire right here. It's all sinful and stuff." Or sometimes it's not sinful. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2332s">00:38:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they started saying, "I just want God to take it away." I'm kind of like, "You know, I think God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2338s">00:38:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">wants you to take that off. If you think it's bad for you, you should take it off." Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2341s">00:39:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Why does God have to change our shirt for us? If we're growing and we're mature enough to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2348s">00:39:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">recognized like, "Shirt's dirty," should change it. Right? That's the way it should be. I asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2354s">00:39:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the questions is, "Whose responsibility is it to change?" Right? And I think it's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2361s">00:39:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a disservice if we think that we're just simply waiting for God to do it. Now, think about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2367s">00:39:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">though. Even within that scenario, God is going to be the one who purchased a shirt. God is the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2374s">00:39:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be the one who gives a direction which shirt to put on. God's going to be the one to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2378s">00:39:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">show us, "Hey, your shirt is sour." God's going to be the one who says, "You know what? You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2383s">00:39:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">change that shirt right here because you're in the safety of my home." God is in absolute control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2388s">00:39:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? God is in absolute control. But as our Heavenly Father, He expects us to be able to tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2397s">00:39:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your shirt is filthy. Go change. That's my point. Why do I say this? Because the biggest problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2406s">00:40:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and resistance of all of these excuses as why we're not changing certain things is not because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2413s">00:40:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God didn't give us stuff. It's not because God didn't give us the resources. There is deep within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2419s">00:40:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us something that says, "But I love this shirt.

But in this one, I look so cool." Right? Those are the rationales that needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2431s">00:40:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">change. And that's why scripture says, "You need to be renewed in the spirit of your mind." You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2437s">00:40:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be convinced when God says, "Change your shirt.

You have to agree with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2442s">00:40:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">God and says, "You know what?

Again, using different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2450s">00:40:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">analogies, some people who struggle like crazy with anger, crazy with temperamentalism. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2456s">00:40:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just like, "You know what though? This is my tough love." Okay? You can just redefine everything then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2462s">00:41:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to excuse it. Okay?

"You know what though?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2468s">00:41:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is who I am." It's like, "What? Who you was was corrupt." It's absolutely corrupt. And as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2476s">00:41:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">matter of fact, it's continuing to be corrupted with its deceits, let's say. And even with lust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2483s">00:41:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">while it's not always talking about sexuality, sometimes we lust for control and we use our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2488s">00:41:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">anger for control.

Do not allow things that you see, like, "You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2606s">00:43:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what?

Now, sometimes, yes, like the analogy of the homes, we see things in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2611s">00:43:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">our house like, "Man, I really got to get to the lawn because the sprinklers are broken," but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2615s">00:43:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you just don't get to it. Now, when it comes to our own souls, though, we have to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2621s">00:43:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this impetus, that we are regularly taking those things and renewing it in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2627s">00:43:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If we take a look at this passage, though, it says, "This renewing of the spirit and of the mind,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2633s">00:43:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "put on the new self, and this new self is in the likeness of God," which in, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2639s">00:43:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, which is in God, which is of God, "has been created in righteousness and holiness of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2644s">00:44:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">truth." And what I like to say is, notice that it's both the aspect of that your mind is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2650s">00:44:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">renewed, you're changed in your thinking, and you believe what God is believing, or what God has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2654s">00:44:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">been teaching, and that you're putting on the new self, which is mimicking after God. And by way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2661s">00:44:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">conclusion, I'd like to have us think about this by saying, and so, today I've been giving a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2667s">00:44:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">examples about children. There is this question I want to ask you. How do you make a child not spoil?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2673s">00:44:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, how do you make a child not spoil? Well, one way you can do it is, you know what? When I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2679s">00:44:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a kid, I didn't have all these toys. I didn't have, like, a wall full of Legos. I didn't have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2684s">00:44:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my parents didn't even hug me. So, you could deprive your child to teach him to not take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2690s">00:44:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things for granted, right? So, you're just like, "You know, I'm not going to hug you either,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2693s">00:44:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You could do that as a means to say, "I want to teach you to appreciate the little I give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2697s">00:44:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you." Now, I'm not sure that's the best way to do it, okay? Because to be spoiled means not so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2705s">00:45:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that you received a lot of love. Why? Because in every single one of us, we've been spoiled rotten,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2710s">00:45:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That's the book of Ephesians for us. We have been, like, lavished, poured on with love by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2718s">00:45:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">God to an extent where, like, our cup, the picture we should have is, like, overflowing, cups</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2724s">00:45:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">overflowing with grace and mercy and love. And the embrace of God is so sweet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2732s">00:45:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, then, every single one of us would be spoiled rotten. You see, spoiled rotten is to have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2738s">00:45:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">attitude where you receive that, but you never mimic it. You don't know how to give it, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2744s">00:45:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the reason why I want to do this is because to say, if we are being renewed, we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2750s">00:45:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then going to be mimicking God as our Father who has loved us so deeply, and that we are mimicking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2756s">00:45:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Him in all of His righteousness and holiness and of truth. That we are trying to follow in His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2762s">00:46:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">footsteps. Essentially, we're trying to look like Him. We're trying to be like Him, think like Him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2767s">00:46:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like Him. That, to us, is both our greatest endeavor and our greatest reward. There's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2774s">00:46:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be nothing more glorious than to be able to reflect God's character, His truthfulness, His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2780s">00:46:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">love. And what's more for us than what I'm trying to say is we're not just changing for the sake of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2785s">00:46:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">style.

Our goal is very, very specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2792s">00:46:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to make sure that as I change, I change into the image of my God. Let's take a moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/417859674#t=2797s">00:46:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to pray.
