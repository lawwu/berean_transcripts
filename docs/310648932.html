he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/310648932#t=1719s">00:28:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't know how to swim.</span></div><div class="c"><span

it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/310648932#t=1727s">00:28:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">dangerous because they don't make any noise when they
