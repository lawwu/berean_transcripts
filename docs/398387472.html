at our passage in Ephesians chapter two, starting from verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=71s">00:01:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">19

passage in context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=78s">00:01:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to review for a moment the things that happened already in chapter two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=86s">00:01:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember that in chapter two, we were reminded in part one about the amazing truth of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=91s">00:01:31.140</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=96s">00:01:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">God made us alive together with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=100s">00:01:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And this he was doing to show his surpassing riches of the grace and kindness towards us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=106s">00:01:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=113s">00:01:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">22, we notice that he was revealing the relational reconciliation aspect of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=123s">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this in your packet is a blank for you there to jot in that God was showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=129s">00:02:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">within this passage, the relational reconciliation in which, although we were incredibly far,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=136s">00:02:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">although we were separate, although essentially we were without hope and without a God in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=140s">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the world, through Christ he has brought us near.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=144s">00:02:24.240</a></span> | <span

matter of fact, that to us then is our greatest gain, that we have access relationally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=152s">00:02:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to God the Father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=154s">00:02:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now one thing to highlight, this portion today, verse 19 through 22, is the ending portion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=161s">00:02:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of that long, long paragraph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=163s">00:02:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just one long paragraph that we split into because there was so much there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=169s">00:02:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so with that said, we want to then go into looking at our passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=177s">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Here I'll read it for us, starting from verse

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=257s">00:04:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is just go through the questions, the study questions that I had laid out, and one by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=263s">00:04:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one go through the questions and answer them, and that's how I'll review the passage for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=266s">00:04:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in question one, I asked this question, in verse 19 through 22, what is the relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=275s">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with this portion, with the previous section of scripture, as it's supposed to belong together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=280s">00:04:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in what way does it do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=282s">00:04:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, recall again, that if the section was saying that you were dead, and then you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=288s">00:04:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">made alive, and if in chapter two, we were being taught that we were far off, but now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=293s">00:04:53.120</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=302s">00:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of those gospel truths, that as Christ is working the gospel, meaning working out salvation,</span></div><div

are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=316s">00:05:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and that begins already in the previous section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=319s">00:05:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, if you notice the PowerPoint, I highlight for you the ramifications that the passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=325s">00:05:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is already teaching us, that Christ, in doing so, in causing us to be reconciled, is making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=331s">00:05:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">us

the ramifications of what Christ is doing in salvation, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=347s">00:05:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so in our section today, we're looking here, and I'd like to highlight for you, as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=351s">00:05:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">read this section one more time, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=356s">00:05:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household, and if you notice, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=363s">00:06:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bolded the words at the beginning, so then, as a means to show you that kind of ramification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=369s">00:06:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and then what's more, the second half of this portion, starting from verse 20, it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=373s">00:06:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"Having been built on

as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=398s">00:06:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">believers, are becoming these entities.</span></div><div

us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=409s">00:06:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you notice, after each metaphor, after each picture, I placed a little arrow, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=416s">00:06:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those metaphors, those pictures then have ramifications even of their own, that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/398387472#t=421s">00:07:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is what the
