href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=93s">00:01:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've been, generally speaking, if we were to title chapter 1 through 11 with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=96s">00:01:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one word, it would be justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=99s">00:01:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do we need justification?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=106s">00:01:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically 11 chapters is about how someone gets saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=113s">00:01:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We are justified by the blood of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=114s">00:01:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So chapter 12 through 16, we're entering into a new section, and it is not different, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=120s">00:02:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the emphasis definitely is different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=122s">00:02:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of the teaching of justification is going to lead us to sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span

about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=135s">00:02:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">justification, which we have for the last 11 chapters, I typically get people coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=140s">00:02:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up to me and say, "Well, when are we going to talk about practical stuff, telling people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=145s">00:02:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this and do that?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=147s">00:02:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then whenever I tend to spend a lot of time on the application aspect of it, I always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=152s">00:02:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">get somebody in the congregation who will come up to me and say, "Oh, how come we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=156s">00:02:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">not talking enough about justification, and about the blood of Christ, and about the gospel?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=162s">00:02:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we follow whatever the scripture teaches, and we're following this pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=166s">00:02:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, so for a period, starting from chapter 12, we're going to be talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=170s">00:02:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=171s">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does it mean if you confess these truths of 11 chapters, what does it mean in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=176s">00:02:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">application?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=177s">00:02:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to just quickly read again in verse 1, where Paul says, "I appeal to you therefore."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=185s">00:03:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore meaning this is a summary of everything that he said up to 11 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=188s">00:03:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">"I appeal to you in light of all of this, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=194s">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=199s">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">act of

that subject alone, you could probably spend the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=217s">00:03:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">our lives just talking about sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=219s">00:03:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">As much as we can spend a lot of time talking about justification, we can talk a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=223s">00:03:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification because sanctification is at the core of how the church is run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=233s">00:03:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So oftentimes people ask the question, "So what's the distinction between a Baptist and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=237s">00:03:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a Presbyterian or the Charismatics versus the Methodist?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=242s">00:04:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the core of it, there really isn't much debate over justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=249s">00:04:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We all agree, if you don't agree on justification, you wouldn't be an evangelical Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=255s">00:04:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We wouldn't be able to fellowship together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=257s">00:04:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You wouldn't be a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=259s">00:04:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why we have different denominations is because the application of this looks very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=264s">00:04:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">different from church to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=266s">00:04:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because the view of sanctification is very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=269s">00:04:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to give you a quick overview, and this is not comprehensive, but this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=274s">00:04:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a quick overview of how this is applied in different groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=280s">00:04:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The first group, we'll call them the Wesleyan group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=284s">00:04:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The Wesleyan group basically is, John Wesley is the one who started the Methodist church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=290s">00:04:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of you guys who may have been raised in a Methodist church, it is not just a Methodist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=294s">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're just going to call it the Wesleyan view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=296s">00:04:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The Wesleyan view believes that you can lose your salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=302s">00:05:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a heavy emphasis on human responsibility, and the reason why they are called the Methodist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=307s">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is because their view of sanctification is that you have to apply discipleship and methods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=313s">00:05:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to be disciplined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=315s">00:05:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's heavy emphasis on what you need to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=318s">00:05:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a heavy emphasis on accountability, heavy emphasis on structure, heavy emphasis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=323s">00:05:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">on accountability and leader/follower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=327s">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so none of these things are wrong, but at the core of how people change, how people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=334s">00:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">apply the truths of the Word of God so that we are growing in our faith is through methods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=340s">00:05:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the variations of that, we have false doctrines of perfectionism, which believes that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/244418675#t=347s">00:05:47.220</a></span> | <span
