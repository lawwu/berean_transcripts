class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1885s">00:31:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's going to be peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1889s">00:31:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Which offering in the Old Testament illustrates this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1896s">00:31:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the major offerings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1901s">00:31:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Peace offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1904s">00:31:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Peace offering, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1906s">00:31:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have five major offerings in the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1908s">00:31:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You have, if we're playing trivia, I'll give you extra points if you do all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1913s">00:31:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the main offerings, or the five offerings, is peace offering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1917s">00:31:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The peace offering was, they would give the offering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1920s">00:32:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and they would only burn the stuff that they couldn't eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1923s">00:32:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the meaty stuff, they saved, and then they would end up having a picnic on the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1928s">00:32:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So with the priests and with the family members, they would come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1932s">00:32:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that offering signified is that because we have peace with God, we have peace with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1938s">00:32:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of symbolizes, there is no direct connection from that to the communion table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1944s">00:32:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you understand the significance of the communion table, it's very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1949s">00:32:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That because we have peace with God, we have union with one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1954s">00:32:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's basically the communion table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1956s">00:32:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we see here playing out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1959s">00:32:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because now that they have peace with God, that all this contention, all this war and fighting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1964s">00:32:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be done away with, and there's going to be unity and peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1968s">00:32:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, the teaching is, every generation, they're looking for peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1973s">00:32:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You have peace signs. Why can't we have peace? Why can't we just all get along?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1977s">00:32:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can change politics, but until sin is eradicated, there will never be peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1985s">00:33:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, that's what's being illustrated here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1989s">00:33:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, "In that day, Israel, Egypt, and Assyria will together be a blessing in the midst of the earth."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=1995s">00:33:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That not only will Israel be blessed, that all the other nations will be a blessing as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2001s">00:33:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what God intended from the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2005s">00:33:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">[inaudible]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2023s">00:33:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Historical, Christological, and then ultimately Second Coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2028s">00:33:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">[inaudible]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2034s">00:33:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, historically, I mean, obviously the language, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2038s">00:33:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I mean, I guess you can kind of say they were united in Greek, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2045s">00:34:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So language-wise, you could say, "Kh," but united in serving the Lord together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2051s">00:34:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that ever really happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/152723409#t=2055s">00:34:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe, I guess you could milk it.
