been talking about the practice of biblical love up to this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=122s">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we may get to chapter 13 and all of a sudden he's switching gears and now talking about submitting to government and paying taxes again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=130s">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not something that we would typically want to choose to talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=135s">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But first we have to ask ourselves, why is this here in the first place?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=140s">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that he's writing this letter to the Church of Rome and that was at that time the epicenter of power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so being very aware that this church is being watched by the governing officials,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=153s">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that there might have been some concern that Paul is writing this letter and making sure that the church is not in a rebellion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=160s">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever happens in Rome may end up having a ripple effect throughout the known world at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=165s">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That could have been the reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=167s">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another reason where Paul says in the previous chapter, he says not to take vengeance when somebody wrongs you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=173s">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there could have been a situation where the government was coming down on the church and maybe bringing physical harm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=180s">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">making it difficult for them to survive to care for their family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result, the vengeance that they may have been thinking about may be against the authorities in the Roman government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=188s">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Paul's practical application of that is to suppress that and basically says not to react and leave room for the vengeance of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=195s">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">instead to submit to the government authorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=197s">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now all of these things may be true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=199s">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul may have been aware that he's writing this letter about submitting and giving authority to God, calling Him Lord and Savior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=208s">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Possibly as this letter is being taken to the Church of Rome, that maybe somebody's going to confiscate it and take it to the Roman authorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=215s">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that maybe that may have been a crime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=217s">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can speculate and read into all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=221s">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is a much bigger reason why this is taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now whether you lived 2,000 years ago, whether you lived 500 years ago, whether you live here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a universal reason why this is so important as Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=237s">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is not simply for us to be good citizens, because that's what good Christians are called to be, even though that is the teaching here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=245s">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the core rebellion of mankind, the core rebellion of mankind is basically willfully this will be done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The act that demonstrated that in the book of Genesis is basically taking a fruit that they weren't supposed to eat and they ate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now if you take that out of context, it doesn't seem like a big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=269s">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That whole sin of mankind, the judgment of mankind, the reign of death over mankind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=277s">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">came in because of the simple disobedience of eating something that they weren't supposed to eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=283s">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we talked about that, even the disobedience of the breaking of the Sabbath in the Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why that incurred capital punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=292s">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because there was a willful rebellion to resist submission to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=297s">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can say that the core rebellion of mankind against God is a willful disrespect, a rebellion, and refusal to submit to God's authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">R.C. Sproul describes it this way, "The universal call to submit to authority touches the root of our corruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=317s">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone is a sinner, and every sin is an act of revolt against authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=322s">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we respected the authority of God perfectly, we would never sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=326s">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sin is a refusal to submit to the governing authority of God, God himself, and God knows that about us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=332s">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we are not willing to submit to God, it is more difficult to submit to the police department, the government, and other authorities that rule over us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=340s">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the duty of every Christian to be in subjection to the authorities."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=345s">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in other words, R.C. Sproul basically has articulated what I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=350s">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that at the core of our rebellion is our refusal to submit to God, and our refusal to submit to God is a reflection, again, of our core rebellion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=359s">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why when he calls us to submit, it has more to do with who we are in rebelling against God than simply not calling us to be good citizens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=370s">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's three reasons, mind you, kids, why we need to submit to the authorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=374s">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, even before I get to that, I'm going to be talking about at the tail end of the sermon, but even before I get to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=381s">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to acknowledge that I'm assuming that there are a bunch of you sitting here who may have not voted for Trump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=389s">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe despise the things coming out of his mouth and some of the policies that he has,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=393s">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and said, you know, that you think that he needs to be called out, and the submission,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=398s">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">possibly he must not be talking about this particular situation because Paul does not know Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=405s">00:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you, I'm assuming some of you may be thinking that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=409s">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Understand the context of what Paul is talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=412s">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's talking about people who are under the rule of the Roman government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=416s">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you know, the Roman government, for the first 300 years of Christian experience, were so harsh against the Christians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=424s">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that the majority of the mission work that took place in the first 300 years were families with young children who were running for their lives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=432s">00:07:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of the persecution, because men and women were being dragged into the Coliseum to be torn apart by lions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=439s">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and burned at the stake, that they were treated so cruelly for the first 300 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/265639230#t=444s">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as they were running for their lives,
