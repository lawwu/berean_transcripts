a man? You can't ask, like, what is a man? I mean, that's the ridiculous of our generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1506">00:25:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can't even define what a woman or what a man is.

The reason why I'm in this text is because the qualification of an elder, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1525">00:25:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of the qualifications is he needs to be able to manage his own household, and then verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1528">00:25:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">five says, if he doesn't know how to manage his own household, how will he manage the church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1533">00:25:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So the home was a proving ground for the elder. The home, the father is just a smaller leader in his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1542">00:25:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">own home, and he who does a good job qualifies for the elder. So all the qualifications that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1549">00:25:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned here are directly related to what it means to be a good father. All the qualities that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1556">00:25:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is necessary for the father is the same quality that is described as being a good elder. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1561">00:26:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">why I want to spend this morning looking at these qualities that Paul mentions here. And practically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1567">00:26:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, how does that apply to being a good father? Now, when we look at these qualities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1573">00:26:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on what the leader is called to do, the qualities may sound different. So if you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1580">00:26:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">for a head coach, it may look very different. He's going to lead, but he's going to lead for the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1586">00:26:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of winning a basketball game. And he may be harsh and disciplined. And you know, if you don't meet up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1591">00:26:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain skill level, you're going to have to be strong enough to cut them off. But his primary thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1597">00:26:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">may not be nurturing. He just needs to win the championship. So based on that, certain qualities that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1602">00:26:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you want in a coach, your personnel, if you're a CEO of a company, what qualities does he need to have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1611">00:26:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a president of a university, what qualities does he need to have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1615">00:26:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So based upon what he is called to do, the qualities may shift. So in order for us to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1623">00:27:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">why these specific qualities are mentioned here, it's just a random set of maybe seven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1630">00:27:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">eight, nine things. This is what leadership should have everybody. Or is there a specific thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1637">00:27:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that he is calling them to do that requires these qualities above the others? And it is clear that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1644">00:27:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the case. When Paul is writing this letter to Timothy, Paul is equipping his predecessor or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1651">00:27:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">his disciple to do what he was doing. So when he is gone, he would take over the task. And that task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1660">00:27:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is to fight. To fight. He begins, and all throughout Timothy, there are military terms that are mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1670">00:27:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">here. He says in 1 Timothy 3:3, he says, "I command you." Right? "I command you." And it's a military term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1678">00:27:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "As I was commanded by Jesus, now I, as your commanding officer, I command you." That same language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1685">00:28:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is mentioned in verse 18, chapter 5, verse 7, chapter 6, verse 13. In fact, the very description of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1692">00:28:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual battle, 1 Timothy 1:18, it says, "Wage the good warfare."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1697">00:28:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter 6, verse 12, he says, "Fight the good fight." All throughout 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1705">00:28:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul is using military terms because he is trying to ready this young man for spiritual battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1712">00:28:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "You're going to go here, and you're going to fight these false prophets, false teachers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1717">00:28:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're going to command them to stop teaching these false battles. You're going to fight with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1722">00:28:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Command them to stop doing this." So he has to equip Timothy and the pastors to get into this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1729">00:28:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual warfare. So you'll notice the qualifications of an elder here are qualifications of a soldier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1736">00:28:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">These are qualifications that is necessary to be able to engage in this spiritual battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1743">00:29:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think for us to better understand that if you've ever watched movies or maybe you've seen videos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1749">00:29:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">where military commanders stand before their soldiers before they go into battle and they give a war cry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1756">00:29:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">right? For the sake of time, I'm not going to read any, right? But some of you guys know what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1760">00:29:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about. You have General Patton before, you know, he gets into the battle. You have MacArthur before he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1767">00:29:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">he comes in and, you know, in the Korean War. And so you have all these stories. And then you watch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1773">00:29:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">these movies where the commanding officer gives a war cry and he rallies the men that we need to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1779">00:29:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and make sure that you stay sober. We're going to protect our country. We're going to protect our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1782">00:29:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">children, our wives. And then you get the soldiers to rally up and to get them ready to fight the good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1789">00:29:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">fight. That's basically what Paul is doing here in 1 Timothy. He's trying to get this young soldier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1796">00:29:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to get ready for battle. And so I want you to understand that everything Paul says here is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1803">00:30:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the context of preparing the soldier for this spiritual battle. So the first thing that he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1810">00:30:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is an elder, again, when I say elder, elder is representative of the father, okay? At least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1816">00:30:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">this morning, because he can be used interchangeably. A leader, a father, an elder, it is a trustworthy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1824">00:30:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">statement. If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is fine work he desires to do. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1830">00:30:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">when you look at that, it aspires that he wants to be an elder. He wants to be a leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1835">00:30:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Negatively, we can look at that and say, well, that guy has an ego. He wants to be in the front and be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1841">00:30:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">recognized. He wants to be set apart as better than other people. And that's why you say, if you desire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1847">00:30:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to be an elder, this kind of seems egotistical. But that's not what this means. Someone who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1854">00:30:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">aspiring is not aspiring for attention, aspiring to be an influence on other people. He's aspiring for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1861">00:31:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for the role of an overseer, that he is caring for people. He is sacrificing. He's giving his life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1868">00:31:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for the purpose of other people. So it's not just wishful thinking that he is living his life for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1876">00:31:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of other people's benefit. So an individual who is aspiring for this is not just somebody who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1884">00:31:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">hoping. In fact, if you're not a leader before you have a title, you're not a good leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1890">00:31:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The best leaders are the ones who are leading without the title, without the attention, without honor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1897">00:31:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And he is sacrificing and he's giving and he's living his life for the benefit of other people. He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1903">00:31:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">first and foremost, he must aspire for this. And that is no different for a father.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1909">00:31:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">A good father is not somebody who is born and say, you know what, some good fathers were born and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1914">00:31:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">bad fathers were born.

There are certain techniques or skills that you need to hone in on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1945">00:32:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and you need to have discipline. You need to do this for a long period of time because you know the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1949">00:32:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">goal is clear that you need to win these games. And so you're aspiring for the purpose of competing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1957">00:32:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this game. So in the same way, the father must aspire, meaning that he needs to be intentional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1963">00:32:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">In our culture, because parenting and mothering is almost kind of a side issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1975">00:32:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't really take fatherhood and motherhood seriously until you actually become a father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvKQT9Hs4GQ&t=1981">00:33:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or mother.
