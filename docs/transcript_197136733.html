And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people. For unto you this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And it shall be a sign unto you. You shall find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in the manger. And suddenly, it was with the angel, a multitude of heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, Lord, you've got a heir. And the Lord's peace and good will to him be.  Shepherds came to see the baby stood by his mother's side. And you lay your Savior inside a manger. Oh, what a glorious night. Oh, what a glorious night. I hear the angels singing, hallelujah, let the earth receive her King. I know that love has come. Sing it out, Jesus Christ is born. Jesus Christ is born. Yeah.  Shepherds wondered, they couldn't hide it, told everyone in sight. Oh, amazed when they learned how God came down on this glorious night. God came down on this glorious night. I hear the angels singing, hallelujah, let the earth receive her King. I know that love has come. Sing it out, Jesus Christ is born. Jesus Christ is born. Yeah. Glorious, glorious, what a glorious night. Glorious, glorious, what a glorious night. I hear the angels singing, hallelujah, let the earth receive her King. I know that love has come. Sing it out, Jesus Christ is born. I hear the angels singing, hallelujah, let the earth receive her King. I know that love has come. Sing it out, Jesus Christ is born. Jesus Christ is born.   All is calm now, all is quiet, stars shining in the sky. Maybe though in Bethlehem the King is sleeping. Oh, what a glorious night. Oh, what a glorious night. Merry Christmas!                                                     Yeah, let's give him another hand.   (applause)</p></div></body></html>
