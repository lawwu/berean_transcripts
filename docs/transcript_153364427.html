One is, again, because it's a general review and we're going over 19 chapters, so we're not, we're just, all we're going to be doing is going over just kind of like the broad outline. Is this too loud? Yeah, broad outline of the 19, actually, technically it's going to be up to 23 chapters.</p><p>And then after that portion, we're going to have, we're going to play some games, okay? Well, it's actually not a game. I'm just going to ask you a question, you're going to answer, okay? It is a game. It's going to be no-frills game. So basically what's going to happen is, I'm going to tally up the points.</p><p>So it's going to be based on the outline that I gave you. We're going to be going over the outline. You're going to have the fill-ins. I'm going to go over the outline. And then the questions that I'm going to be asking you is going to be related, mostly related to the outline.</p><p>The reason why I wanted to do this is kind of to reemphasize twice, and then I'll give you time to discuss and think through. So the goal of the review is not so that you can like know here's the flow and know all the details of each chapter. So at the minimum, you can see the broad outline.</p><p>And then if I said chapter 3, you know, you kind of know what's going on in chapter 3. If I said chapter 13, you kind of know what's going on in chapter 13. And then all the major prophesies, messianic prophecies, that you kind of know where it is. So that when you think of the book of Isaiah, at least for the first 23 chapters, you'll have a broad outline that's memorized in your head.</p><p>So that's the goal today, okay? So we're not going to get into too much detail today because again, the purpose of this is to ingrain in you the outline of the book of Isaiah that we're up to. Okay? All right, so do you have any leftover on tables, anybody?</p><p>You know, I forgot to email again. So if you need more, raise your hand. If you have more at your table, raise your hand. Okay. Okay. So just to kind of give you, if you look at the outline, you'll see that there's A, B, and C. A, B, C.</p><p>And so up to chapter 23, it's broken down into three large, okay, thematic. It doesn't fit perfectly, but I think for the purpose of your memorization. So if you look at the first one, let me see. Somebody at this table, can you read A for us? Johnny? Okay. So that's chapter one through six is about the description of Israel's rebellion and God's restoration.</p><p>Okay? And then so the six chapters broadly fit under that topic. Chapter B, if I can have Jonas. Okay. So again, not every single chapter may fall under that, but from chapter seven through chapter 12 is promise of deliverance for God's remnant. Okay? And then C, God's judgment of the nations.</p><p>So I only have up to chapter 20 because that's all we covered, but that theme actually takes us all the way to chapter 23. Okay? So let's just think in our heads, even before we start. Chapter one through six is. All right, exactly. Okay. One more time. Chapter one through six, Israel's rebellion against God and plan of restoration.</p><p>That's one through six. Okay. Chapter seven through 12, promise of deliverance of God's remnant. Okay. So it's pretty easy. You got, you got 12 chapters already. Right? And then the last part of it from chapter 13 to 23 is God's judgment to the nation. All right. Review done. Right?</p><p>So that's, so I, what I want you to remember at least is that three large, you know, themes. First theme, don't look at it this time. All right. Israel's rebellion against God and God's plan for restoration. B. So it'd be a choir to be like. All right. And then third is God's judgment of the nations.</p><p>Okay. So that's a broad outline. So what we're going to be talking about is filling the details of what's happening. So I want you to pay attention to, to the outline. Try to memorize it as much as you can, because after I'm done reviewing or going over it, we're going to, I'm going to be asking questions.</p><p>And the questions I'm going to be asking is, I'm going to give you a verse. I'm going to ask you what chapter that's in. Okay. And then I'm going to have you guys raise hand, tell me what chapter that's in. And the verses are kind of taken out based upon the themes in here.</p><p>Okay. So if you know the theme well, when the, when the verse comes up, it'll be easier for you to raise your hand. And if your table wins, we'll have a gift card for you to go out and eat with your table. Okay. With your table. All right. So 15 bucks, dollar per person.</p><p>All right. No, I was just kidding. A real, real meal for your small group. Okay. But it has to be, you can't deviate up. You have to go with your small group. Okay. All right. Let's begin. Oops, sorry. Okay. This is just kind of a, before we get into it, just a quick review of Israel's history.</p><p>Okay. Just, just remember, I know a lot of you guys already know this, but just Israel's history, it begins with Saul. Saul's the first King of Israel. His son is David. David's son is Solomon. And then Solomon's child, Rehoboam, right? So after he dies, Rehoboam is the rightful successor of the, of the throne.</p><p>But what ends up happening is Rehoboam decides that he's going to, he's going to cause them to pay heavy tax. And so the nation of Israel gets angry and Jeroboam leads the rebellion against Israel and he takes 10 of the tribes and then he goes up north. And so the kingdom splits in half.</p><p>So the two tribes, tribe of Judah, tribe of Benjamin stays with Rehoboam. So even though neither of them are righteous, right? This split happens, humanly speaking, because Rehoboam chooses to, you know, take advantage of the people and these people take off. So ever since then, ever since this happens, there's two kingdoms that split, right?</p><p>And so this kingdom, it keeps, it keeps going. This is the kingdom that we call the, the Northern Kingdom. They have 10 tribes. They're the ones who fall into captivity, but to the Assyrians first, right? And then later on the Babylonians take the Southern Kingdom. Okay. When does the prophecy of Isaiah take place?</p><p>Has any of these kingdoms fallen yet? Not yet. These guys are about to fall. They didn't fall yet. So he is prophesying during this period to the Southern Kingdom and he's prophesying about what's happening with these guys, but then, but he's also saying that this is the same thing is going to happen to you.</p><p>Okay. So that's the background behind Isaiah's prophecy. Okay. Yes. All right. So just, just kind of give you a heads up on a quick history of game. Israel is right here, Jerusalem. So the Northern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem. I'll start with this. Southern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem, this area. Northern Kingdom splits and then they end up going into this area.</p><p>Okay. So this here together is Israel, but the Southern Kingdom is located down here and then the Northern Kingdom is up here. Okay. Now so much of Israel's history is about their interaction with three major kingdoms. You have the Egyptians down here and you have the Assyrians and the Babylonians are at the time that, that Isaiah is prophesying Babylon, Babylon has not taken over this yet.</p><p>So Assyria is here. Babylon is in the outer sides of over here. Eventually they're going to conquer Assyria and then this is going to be the Babylonian kingdom. Okay. Eventually. Right. So Isaiah is prophesying during this period where if they, if Israel wanted to survive, humanly speaking, they have to attach themselves with one of these kingdoms.</p><p>So in order to protect themselves from Assyria, sometimes they would pay tribute to Babylon, right? Or sometimes they will pay tribute to the Egypt or Cush. So different nations hoping that if we ally with them, that they're going to help us. And so a lot of God's prophecies in book of Isaiah is telling them that you think you're safe because you have some sort of alliance with the Babylonians, but in the end they're also going to be humbled.</p><p>They're also going to be judged, right? That your hope is placed in the wrong place. You should have hoped in God and not these people. So a lot of Isaiah's prophecies is about them jockeying position and putting their trust in these foreign nations. Okay. All right. That's a brief background.</p><p>So let's go. Um, a Israel's rebellion against God and his plan of restoration. So chapter one, if you remember Israel's sin of not recognizing their master, remember the, the verse here that donkeys, the animals recognize their master, but Israel does not. Right? So it begins as an indictment. So that it's kind of like a courtroom where the lawyer is standing.</p><p>Isaiah is kind of like the lawyer standing, indicting the nation of Israel. This is, this is your sin and here's how you sinned against God. Right? And that's basically chapter one. Within that chapter, remember we talked about false religion, like all your temple worship sacrifices. They're meaningless to me because why, why were they meaningless?</p><p>They were trying to appease God with their false religion. They're rebelling against God in every other area, but they thought if they came to the temple and gave sacrifices, that somehow that was going to make up for what they were doing outside of the temple. But God saying that false religion is not going to have any effect on God.</p><p>In fact, it's angering God. And then it, if you notice in your outline, you'll see indentations on some of these, right? You have ABCD and then you have some indention that says, I, you know, one or two, all the indentations I indented it because those are where God breaks in in the midst of prophesying judgment.</p><p>He breaks in and says, but God's not going to be angry forever. And then he talks about restoration. So all the indentation is where God breaks in and says, he's, he's going to one day forget that and he's going to forget. Okay. So again, we're still in chapter one, 21 to 31, the fall and restoration of God's righteous city.</p><p>Obviously he's referencing Jerusalem, the restoration of the mountain of God, Zion, which all throughout the Bible is used as a place where God dwells. And then he says, your trust and riches and foreign powers will fail you because they will be judged. So as we're going through it, if you have your Bibles, I encourage you guys to open your, keep your Bibles open and flip through it.</p><p>Okay. So if you have your Bibles, just flip through it as we're going through it, as you see this and filling it in, just take a quick glance so that you'll know what we're talking about. Cause we're not, we're not going to jump into the details. F, God will take away our self-confidence and supply soldiers, leaders, and beauty.</p><p>Right? Remember we talked about that, how they're, they feel like their safety is going to be in aligning with the right people or they have the right leaders or, you know, it talks about at the end of chapter three, about the reliance and the beauty and how God's going to come and take away all of that, all the superficial things that, that you're depending on again.</p><p>So here's the first break in, in chapter four, two to six talks about the branch of the Lord. Right? Remember how God's going to wipe them out. It's only going to leave a stump. And from that stump is going to come the branch of the Lord. It talks about how the branch of the Lord is going to restore Israel.</p><p>Right? Chapter five, one through seven, he describes Israel as a vineyard, how he planted and cultivated. And he said, what is it that I have not given you that you needed and yet you produce unrighteousness. So again, systematically God is indicting them. Right? And then the woe statements, chapter five, eight through 30, woe to those who trust and pursue riches above God.</p><p>Okay. So after we go through this, and just before I get into the second section, I'm going to give you maybe about five, ten minutes just to kind of go through your, with your small group, review this with them, with your small group, and then I'm going to start asking questions and see who raises their hand and then, and then we'll play games a little bit.</p><p>Okay. And then chapter six, one through 13 is the famous call of Isaiah. Can you guys see the bottom? You can't see the bottom. There's nothing I can do. Which part? Which, where do you see up to here? Okay. You don't see here? Where? Wait, wait, you see up to H but not I?</p><p>What? Oh, so you don't see this? Okay. Is it just you or is anybody else having a problem? Oh, okay. All right. It's just her. Nobody else is complaining but her. All right, Jane. Thanks, Jane. Isaiah's call. I-S-A-I-A-H-S call. Okay. That's the only one that's that low. Okay. I'm just messing with you.</p><p>All right. Second section, B, promise of deliverance for God's remnant. God will protect Ahaz from Syria. Remember this passage in chapter seven, one through nine, right? What happened here? Syria and Ephraim. Ephraim is another name for the Northern Kingdom, right? So what, what, what does Syria and Ephraim do?</p><p>They, they came to Ahaz and said, ally with us so we can fight against Assyria. Ahaz chooses not to and he, he ends up allying with somebody else and so they get angry and then he, they, they come to attack him. So it's at that time God sends Isaiah to tell him that, no, you, God's gonna protect you.</p><p>God's not done with you. In fact, they're the ones who are gonna get into trouble, right? So that's what's happening here. And again, he breaks in in the middle of that and he says, you know, tell Ahaz that God said this and Ahaz, does he believe it? No, he doesn't believe it.</p><p>It's like, oh, how do I, how can I be sure God's gonna do this? And he said, I'll give you a sign of Emmanuel, right? That he's gonna come through a virgin. And that's where the famous, you know, prophecy about the, about Emmanuel. Remember these passages? Okay? And then he says, God's going to bring Assyria to bring judgment upon Damascus and Samaria.</p><p>Damascus, again, another word for Syria. So Syria and Samaria, right, they're gonna be judged. God's gonna raise up Assyria and instead of protecting yourself, God's gonna actually judge you. And again, it breaks in chapter 9, 1 through 7, the promise of a, promise of a child. Okay. A little bit higher.</p><p>Okay. Second part. Okay. God's anger burns against Israel and their leaders for all, remember this phrase? He repeats it about five, six times. And it's to remind the nation of Israel, even though all this judgment is coming, that you refuse to return. So therefore, he says, for all, for all his anger has not turned away and his hand is stretched out.</p><p>In other words, he's not done with you. The judgment is gonna, is gonna be much heavier than you think. Right? Because they refuse to repent. And then again, I remind Assyria is gonna, as God's agent and target, but also they're going to be the target of God's judgment. Right?</p><p>So it's not that Assyria was righteous, they were just used as an instrument. Kind of like Satan. God allows Satan to work, to bring upon judgment, but ultimately the greatest judgment is reserved for Satan himself. Right? And so that's kind of like the argument here in chapter 10. You know, I mean, go back here.</p><p>You know how God uses Assyria and you know, the, one of the arguments that people typically make about is that right or wrong is based on the fruit. You know, I've heard people say, oh, they did this or they use this method and look at, look at the result.</p><p>And a lot of times we get confused because we say, well, if God is using them to produce something, it must be from God. Right? That's not the case at all. There's a lot of times where God would use agents like Assyria or Babylon and just because it produces fruit doesn't mean that God, God favors that.</p><p>It just means that God is using them. Right? God can use donkeys, he can use rocks. So Assyria is a good example of a nation where God uses, but it wasn't because God favored them. Right? And again, a remnant of Israel will return to Jerusalem in chapter 10, 20 to 34.</p><p>And again, the promise of the branch of Israel coming from the stump. All right. So this part we're going to go over pretty quick because each section obviously has, he has his own judgment against them. If you remember the Babylon when remember when Babylon falls, what was the response of the people?</p><p>Mocking them by celebration because the tyrant is gone. Right? Judgment on Assyria. Remember we told you about how Isaiah is not written chronologically. This is a perfect example of that. Does Babylon come after Assyria or does Assyria come after Babylon? Assyria comes before Babylon. Right? But in the prophecy Babylon and then he jumps back to Assyria.</p><p>So it's not just any chronological order. It's thematic. Philistia, there's a short blurb on them. So he's just kind of going down nation by nation by nation. He's like thorough. Right? Just as God is thorough with his love and grace, he's thorough with his judgment. Remember in the New Testament he says every every careless word, you know, you're going to be accountable for.</p><p>So he says he counts every hair but he also says every careless word is going to be judged. So God's judgment is just as thorough as his love and grace. Judgment of Moab. What was unique about Moab? Why why did they mourn? Who? Lot. Right? So they're cousins. So if you look at the history between between Israel and Moabites, there are periods when they're allies and there are periods when they're fighting against each other but they're like cousins.</p><p>Right? Just like Ephraim. Okay. Damascus. Cush. Remember this is one of the last places that we talked about Cush. Remember what they say about Cush? Cush was what what nation? Ethiopian. Ethiopia is not nearby but they were also a not a superpower like the Assyrians but they were a powerful nation.</p><p>So they're coming over to Jerusalem try to ally with them maybe take tribute but God is telling them the warning them is like these people from far off are not going to help you. They're going to be judged like everybody else. And then judgment of Egypt. Then we didn't I had it read but yours I didn't I forgot to take out.</p><p>Okay. Remember how I talked about at the very end he talks about judgment but because of his judgment what happens? Right? At the end they repent and the remnant of them come back and they said that Egypt, Assyria, and Israel are going to be all united as one and they're going to be a blessing to all the other people.</p><p>Right? So basically if you if you talk about Egypt, Assyria, and Israel they're talking about that piece of land. So if you take it literally it means that God is going God's going to establish his kingdom in that piece of land and that area the that represents these nations are going to be a blessing to all the world.</p><p>Right? So the millennial kingdom if you believe in a physical millennial kingdom is going to be in that piece of land. Which is interesting because so much so much of what's happening in modern day history happens centers around that particular area. Right? And it's always been busy all the way from the Old Testament to the Roman Empire to you know the battle between the Muslims and the Christians and establishing the Eastern and the Western Church.</p><p>I mean Genghis Khan the Mongolians coming and conquering and back and forth. I mean that piece of land is rich in history. Right? So one day all of that is going to disappear. All the violence all the hatred is going to disappear. It's going to be known as a land of peace.</p><p>The language is going to be united and the people are going to be united. Right? Again, chapter 20 ends with reminder of judgment. So we didn't get to chapter 21, 22, 23 but basically it goes over other nations kind of like he does here. Okay? So there's a possibility that next time we pick up I may just begin in chapter 24.</p><p>Okay? Because the theme switches around chapter 24. Okay? So if you're one of those eager students that want to be thorough and you know get things so you got two week break so you got chapter 21, 22 and 23 to go over. Okay? All right. So what I want you to do is I want you to give I'm going to give you about five, ten minutes with your group just kind of go over that material.</p><p>Okay? With each other. I don't know. Discuss it. Read it by yourself. And then about ten minutes I'm going to start asking questions. I got about 25 questions. I'm going to put up a verse. Yeah. I would say about two thirds of it is like that and the other one third is going to be it's just going to be questions.</p><p>Yeah. All right. Okay. I'm just going to you know I'm just going to judge from what I see. It's kind of like roughing the BBA. I'm not going to see everything. Okay. So whatever whatever seems right in my eyes. Right. That's what I'm going to choose. Okay. Yeah. Because it's going to be it's going to be time.</p><p>Yeah. We're not I'm not going to give you a minute. So if you end up if you have to search your Bible you're probably not going to have enough time. Huh? You're not going to have time. So if you raise your hand and I go to you because all I'm asking you is chapter two chapter three.</p><p>It feels like oh wait a second. Chapter. Big. Okay. So you're going to have to if you raise your hand you need to know the chapter. I need to I need to hear it. Okay. I'll give you one two three four five. If you don't say it in in those five seconds then we're going to move on.</p><p>Okay. So don't raise your hand if you don't know. Don't raise your hand and then figure it out. Two seconds. Okay. Two seconds. I was trying to be gracious. All right. Here you go. Oh okay. Okay. Let's do this. The team choose one person to raise your hand. Okay.</p><p>One person in that team to raise your hand. Okay. Was that going to work? Was that not going to work? Huh? I can't hear a word you're saying. Huh? We should have negative huh? So you don't just. Okay. I should have thought this through a little bit. All right.</p><p>Minus points. Minus points. So you only raise it if you actually know. That you don't go and say eight. It's better than lottery odds right? Okay. Here you go. All right. Let's do this. Yeah. Only one person from your. So if somebody in that table knows it tell that one person raise your hand raise your hand.</p><p>And then you have one two three seconds to answer. Okay. And don't do it if you don't know. Okay. Here you go. Here you go. No. The verse is going to come up. Verse is going to come up and then. Yeah. And then you're going to tell me what chapter that's in.</p><p>Okay. Here you go. No practice no practice. Ready? Hey raise your hand if you're the person that's designated can you raise your hand? Okay. That team forfeit? Okay. Yes yes yes yes. Okay yes. Yes. Okay all right. Raise your hand high. I can't see. Ready? Here you go. All right.</p><p>Ready? Ready? Richard first. Okay. All right. Yeah. One thirteen. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You figure it out. I'm keeping track. Yeah. One one point. Why? Because a better view? You don't you just don't trust Richard. Should have worn a t-shirt. Hand raised. Ready?</p><p>I might be blank again. Oh. After seven fourteen. Easy ones in the front. Okay. I'm going to stand over here just to be fair. Okay. Gloria. Huh? Chapter nine? Chapter six. Okay. Ready? One two three. Minus minus. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. It's too late now.</p><p>All right. I cannot tell who did it second. Chapter two. Okay. You only get one chance. There's no way I'm going to be able to know. Okay. All right. Ready? Okay. Gloria. One two three. I can't I can't tell who did it. Whoever shoes whoever yells the loudest. Okay.</p><p>Jen I Jen I. Jen I Jen I. Huh? One two five. Okay. Ready? One two. Richard. One two three. Hold on hold on. I know I know who was second on this one. This table. Four. Minus one. Hey. But you were the fastest though. You're the fastest. Ready? Sean.</p><p>Sean. Huh? Eleven. No no no. I called Sean. All right. Ready? I forgot where this ends. Ready? Okay. So as we're doing this, I want you guys to see how it fits into the three major themes. I forgot to tell you that. That's the point of this game. So at least you know how those verses fit into the big theme.</p><p>Okay. That was a waste of eight questions. All right. So. Oh nothing. Oh ho. Okay. Ready? So far. Uh. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure. So far. Dale's group. I've never I haven't seen the hand raised yet. It went up. I just didn't see it. All right.</p><p>Mark's group has one point. Philip's group had one. Lost one. Grace. Did I give it to wrong? How come I X'd it? So you don't have a minus. You just have one. Oh wow. For being greedy, we're going to take that away. James's group zero. David Rims one. Ashley's minus one.</p><p>Joe's group minus one. Cheryl's group. Who did it? Oh no. Zisk does Joe. Okay. It's only one point. Calm down. Cheryl one point. Joe Wu's group zero. Jen. Huh? What happened? Oh that's who you were. Gloria's group had plus one minus one. So you have zero. Right? Okay. Thank you.</p><p>Jenna's group has one. Becky's group nothing yet. Mike's nothing. And then Gloria zero. Okay. All right. Ready? Mike. Huh? Thirteenth. You're tied. You're tied with the two other groups. All right. So you don't feel so bad. All right. Ready? Mike. Thirteenth.
