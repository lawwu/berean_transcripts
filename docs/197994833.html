But I was concerned about that building because it was it had big we're on Big Street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=282s">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought, well, we come here to be safer for the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=285s">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now that our kids ministry, children's ministry have grown, even being here, I get nervous when I see the kids running around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=292s">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm looking forward to just being in a safe area for the kids, at least for the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=296s">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the parents can kind of relax when their kids are having fun over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the day, it's just a building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=301s">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a lot of things that's been happening or hoping sometime in the next month or or a year that we can get in there somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=309s">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully everything will span out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're at the tail end.

building is not going to change a church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=319s">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it can actually be a distraction to the church if we're not careful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=322s">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all of these things that that could be a blessing could easily turn into a curse if we just relax and forget about why we're here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=331s">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes a church church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's been probably over a year that we've been in the Book of Romans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Paul lays out 11 chapters in the Book of Romans about why we ought to live a life that honors

simply so that you can say, well, God loves me that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=357s">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even for

href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=388s">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why he wrote the Book of Romans is because he was headed to Spain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/197994833#t=393s">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul was hoping to stop by Rome and get some support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

why he writes the Book of Romans is to lay out the foundation of what it is that we have in Christ to recruit them for the gospel ministry, which is stated in chapter 12 through 16.</span></div><div
