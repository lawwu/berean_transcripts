That last session we talked about word design. We talked about the question of what do you want. And sometimes, if I confess, there have been seasons in my life where that question was answered by certain things that were incredibly material. Meaning, it was just basic stuff. It was things like cars, toys, houses, whatever it may be. Sometimes we all have moments of struggle where our desires are attached to something very materialistic. Now, at other times, we recognize just as the world does that the materialistic stuff, it provides such temporary satisfaction. As a matter of fact, the old kind of adage of "he who has the most toys wins," we know it's not true. "He who has the most toys" just has a lot of joke. It's a border, and no, you don't win because you're carrying a whole herd behind you. Everybody knows that the more you have, the more trouble you have, the more responsibilities you have, the more, "Oh my goodness, I own this house now, but now I have to go fix the roof, the garage, the fence, and the yard." Everybody has a buyer's remorse because now it comes with a burden. So then, there are times though where we mature and no longer do we attach our desires to materialistic things. We start to look for the intangibles, the things that actually even the world sees as more valuable. What I'm talking about are things like relationships, the intangibles of affection, respect, a legacy, an admiration of the people in your community. Now, the reason why I bring this up is because as we talk about our identity and how that is built, I stated in the morning session that your own personal desire is one key facet of building that identity and how you are judged about who you are. But, right now, what I'm more so talking about is not so much your desire, but other people's desire of you. We're talking about your desirability. So, this second session has everything to do with topics like worth. What are you worth and to who are you worth that? What is your value and who values you? I'm asking a question of maybe something like approval. Who is judging you? Who is approving, qualifying, or validating you? Am I talking about the main concept of people pleasing? Fear of man? Yes, that's the kind of concept I want you guys to think about. In order to introduce this, I want to talk about somebody who's been on the news cycle so much lately, maybe the last two, three months have been crazy. The individual I'm thinking about is Kawai Leonard. Kawai. Cool name. Cool guy. Suddenly funny and all that kind of stuff. It seems that everybody loves him. Everybody wants to have him in their town. And what's really crazy about him is people were so, so concerned because he was going to sign a deal with some team. And the news was dropping that, "Oh, he's talking to this team." And everyone was like, "Could it be?" And even non-individuals who are in the sporting realm, let's say sports commentators or in the front office of a team, they were making him offers. "Come to our city and we'll give you free food." Restaurant owners telling him, "Just come, we'll give you everything you want." And what's more, teams were actually offering him, "We'll bring other people to support you. We will literally build a team around you." Ultimately, Kawai Leonard signed with the team and his contract was a three-year contract worth $103 million. That's insane, right? And the truth of the matter is he could have actually got more if he signed a five-year deal where he could have easily made over $34 million per year. That's crazy, right? Now, some of you guys who are into sports, I'm going to be honest, I'm not into sports that much in terms of this kind of stuff, but it was intriguing because everybody was talking about him, right? Now, I just want you to take a moment to think and fantasize a little bit and imagine if you were Kawai, right? You had this rare physique, tall, strong, athletic, skilled, and everybody wants you. "Come join us! You don't like that guy? I'll get rid of him!" They straight up went to bend over backwards, literally to have him come. And everybody was waiting in anticipation and watching, fans, literally people were screaming out, "We love you!" Can you imagine if you were this guy? The reason I want you to think about that is because, I mean, who would not want that? Now, I know some of you guys, you hate attention. So, anytime someone calls your name or whatever, it's like, "Ooooh!" You freeze. But just being truthful, who would not want to be at the center of that kind of attention when literally everybody is declaring their love for you? Even people who don't even know you, right? It's really interesting. Now, flip that around a little bit. We think about identity crisis, and I talked a little bit about how identity crisis is because sometimes you want something and you don't have it, or identity crisis is because you want certain things and that's not you, right? However, there can be also an identity crisis where the worst case scenario, the fear is that with all your hard work, with all your production, and you try to be the best that you can be, no one cares. You're not worth it, right? You literally try everything you can, you've just put in the hours, you're putting the sweat and tears, and at the end of it, no one really wants you. Yes, I'm talking about the whole concepts of value, I'm talking about worth, and I'm talking about everyone's fear that if they have the attention of the people, people will realize, "Ha, what are you?" People fear not being unique, people fear not having any kind of distinctive skill set, distinctive production, distinctive value, where people will care. And so on the flip side, you get something like, recently on Saturday, I saw a photo go through my Facebook feed of Jeremy Lin crying. I just feel like, "People forgot me." Now, I don't want to make too light of it, I mean, to him, that's his entire life, right? That's his whole career, so I don't want to necessarily make too light of it because that's the real thing. But think about it, right? You've got very two different individuals. One feels like he's on top of the world, the other, even though he has millions, he feels like he's nothing. Why am I talking about this? Because I am talking about the concept of my fear and your fear of being disapproved. I'm talking about also the inner heart wrestling of your identity when you feel like you don't have the approval of either God or your family or your friends. Why is it that people fear public speaking over death? I mean, that statistic just was mind-boggling. You do the study, it wasn't just some silly guy on a blog who happened to ask a hundred people, "Hey, what's your worst fear?" You know, actually, individuals who are professors, doctorate holders, doing assessment of individuals, science graduate supports, asking people, "What are you afraid of?" And if you've ever, if you're an individual who's never had to do any public speaking, if I ask you to come up here and start talking, you're going to physically shake. Why? Because that fear is really real in us. Yes? Okay. Why am I talking about this? Because there is a deep-seated desire in each individual. We have to manage this. Right? We have to feel like there's some kind of meaning to my life. And if there isn't, that is what you call depression. Many of you guys know, I've been studying that topic of depression for a while. I've been counseling people with it. I've been reading books on it. I've been even writing essays upon it. In my talks with individuals, most people who have been depressed, even tempted to struggle with depression, at some point in their lives, the thought either crossed their mind or it came out of their mouth. "I'm worthless." If you guys have ever tried to help somebody in depression, you've probably heard them say that. "I'm worthless." I don't know if any of you have been there. But did you know then what a devastating kind of emotion and feeling and belief that is? If it wasn't just something thrown at you, but you actually believed it, meaning it stuck to you, and you believe those words, "I'm worthless," think about what kind of devastation, what kind of pain. There is no motivation for you. There is no hope for you. It's a darkness. I've been in moments and situations where I've sat down with an individual who has said that to me, and I ask them, "You know what? I know you feel that way, but that is begging so many questions. What standard are you using to think you're worthless? Who is telling you this? You're worthless to who?" And in situations where the depression is deep, they'll actually answer this question. "I'm worthless to everyone. No one." And you believe that? Yes. But what standard are you using? It doesn't even matter. Because I think I'm worthless to my own standard. I'm not even worth it to anyone. And that's when thoughts of suicide, that's when thoughts of ending it are. Those are the moments it comes. Now I'm not sharing this stuff with you just to be somber or just to get some kind of like deep, sad rise out of you. You know, if you've talked with people about their struggles, you know people around you struggle. The statistics already tells you. Like even in secular psychology, even in just school, go ask a high school counselor how many high school students who should be at the prime of their lives with all this energy running around are struggling with deep anxiety and thoughts of infertility. It's a ridiculous amount of individuals. And then my question is to you. I've asked multiple times throughout this retreat, have you struggled with your personal identity? Have you had any moments of crisis where you were confused and lost about who you were? And if you then had those kind of moments, then I'm willing to bet that you struggled with approval. You either struggled with the approval of people who are very important to you, namely your parents, your family, or your closest friends. And if you live with that kind of uncertainty, you walking around with that kind of concern and anxiety, that the people who are most important to you in your life, that they might not approve of you. How are you going to walk around with your family? How are you even going to show your face? You're either going to have to fake it or you're going to have to hide it. And this is why. This is such important and real stuff that people struggle with. And so with that said, I want to say again, point number one is our identity problem is often an approval problem. It's not you having a mind lapse. I forgot that God made me a worshiper. Now that I remember, I'm fine. The solution is not that simple, is it? Our identity problem is not just because you feel like you don't have certain opportunities and circumstances. The diagnosis of our identity crisis is not as simple as, well, you know, you grew up with some harsh parents. And everybody has harsh parents. You just got to keep riding past that. That is not that simple. It's a deeper rooted desire. It's a deeper rooted anxiety. It's a deeper rooted concern. Concern over what? Am I being approved by the people I'm drawn to? And at this point, I want to say, "Love God." Because let me tell you, for those of you who struggle with people pleasing, for those of you who struggle with the fear of man, you know very, very well people are hard to please. If you've run any kind of event, you've led any kind of class, team, whatever it is, you know people are very hard to please. I'm not bringing this up because we all know that the world, the way they judge is by their eyes. We all know the way they judge is by their own standards. It's always, always mobile. It's never immutable like pods. And you are never going to win that game. Love God. A huge part of the gospel is that God according to His great grace has approved you in Christ. This is point number two. But God in His great grace has approved you in Christ. Gospel that we believe in is summarized in so many different ways. He saves sinners. He redeems those who are worthless. He finds and gives light to those who are lost. He adopts those who are children of wrath, children of darkness. But we know the gospel has also certain terminologies that has such specific nuance to approval. For example, please turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 3, verse 21 through 30. Let's take our Bibles to Romans chapter 3, verse 21 through 30. As you guys know in the context of Romans chapters 1 through 3, it is all about every single person, both Gentile and Jew is under sin. You are in such depravity, you're helpless. That's chapter 1 and 3. You're in such depravity, God is giving you over to your depraved minds. But take a look at chapter 3. In chapter 3 starting from verse 21 through 30, this is what the gospel says. "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. For there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus." Right now you should be thinking of two terms, righteousness and justification. I'm going to read on and see how many times he repeats those concepts. "Whom God has displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God, He passed over the sins previously committed for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and a justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting? It is excluded by what kind of law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law. For is God the God of the Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, for the Gentiles also, since indeed God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised by faith, is one." I want you to think about the purity of the gospel, or at least the simplicity of the gospel in this framework. The truth of the gospel is you take an individual who is condemned, who is chapters 1 through 3, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. All of you are bound under sin. I declare you righteous in faith. Before, completely condemned. If you're thinking quality control, absolutely condemned. Does not pass to yes, now approved. Now go to another passage, Colossians chapter 1 verse 9 through 12. Colossians, skip over there, it's chapter 1 verse 9 through 12. Within this, Apostle Paul gives a preliminary admonition of what he desires to see in the people of God. But there is a turn I got stuck on. Take a look at this, starting from verse 9. "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you, but have asked that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has," What? You should highlight this. "qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in blood." What am I saying? Romans said he's justified you, meaning he's taking you from condemned to righteous. The gospel is not, "Hey, guess what? The chains are gone, the bars are open, now go!" No, the gospel is he has changed you. Radically and permanently changed you to be righteous. And what's more now in Colossians, he's qualified you for the inheritance. That's not something you even asked for. You don't go to a rich man and say, "You know, I was buying your inheritance. Pretty, pretty please with cherry on top, can I have it?" No, you don't do that kind of stuff. That's not something you even asked for. But he has qualified you to have that inheritance. Now go over to John chapter 17, verse 13 through 26, where we've been focusing on for a while now. Go back to that passage. Last time we read it, we read it like we were asking the question of, "What does Jesus want?" Now I want you to ask the question, "What kind of acceptance, what kind of approval are we receiving?" Can you repeat that? Read this passage again with a different kind of eye to observing and noticing what is basically God's plan of redemption. And I'm asking the question, "What kind of benefit, what kind of approval and acceptance are we receiving as disciples, as those who have been given God's Word?" Let's take a look again. He says in verse 13, "But now I come to you and these things I speak in the world, so that they may have my joy, may fulfill themselves. I have given them your Word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth, your Word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. For their sake I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. I do not ask on behalf of those alone, but for those who also believe in me through their Word, that they may all be one, even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me. The glory which you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, just as we are one. I in them, you in me, that they may be perfected in unity. So that the world may know that you sent me, and I have loved them, even as you love me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am. I'm going to stop there, and I'm going to do this kind of thing, okay? I want you to appreciate and know the difference when you conceptually think about something like this. Because I want to raise the bar on you and our thinking of this question. Do we as individuals struggle with a crisis? Are we approved? There's a fat question. Are you approved? And then I want you to think about Christ's affection for you, His acceptance of you, and think about how emphatically that question is answered. Because think about this. Earlier I talked about justification. A kind of mere acceptance, maybe, was what we were thinking. When you're justified, you're taken from being in jail to being put out. If you're an individual thinking, "Hmm, is the way that God treats us kind of like an individual who's doing a charity game?" I know this is trash, I know this is junk, but I want to accept it. Why? Because I'm holy. Because I'm merciful and gracious. So fine, sure, you're broken, you're all messed up, but I'll take you. Because that was awesome. You guys understand what I'm saying, right? There is a difference between saying, "Wow, this is pure gold," versus saying, "Wow, this is junk." Since I've got to be nice, I'll take it. I'm trying to convince you that God is not operating on a level where He's just saying, "You know what? I'll take it. I'll take whatever." But what's more, the next part of it, He says, not only did He just simply accept, but there was an element of qualification where He brought you up to a point where, "Yes, think about this, okay? If I'm qualified to enter into a school, now I deserve it, don't I?" That's weird, right? We would never even talk like that about heaven. "I deserve it. I'm qualified." That's the craziness of the Gospel. That's the craziness of the Gospel. He has qualified you, made you righteous, so that when you enter, you don't have to feel like, "Oh yeah, by the way, if God had such pity on me, I know I suck, but I'm here." It's not like when you play basketball, you know you can't dribble, you know you can't pass. They're like, "Oh man, we've got to give that guy some time. Hey, come on and play for five minutes." That is not the Gospel. Now raise that up to another bar. Scripture says that the way that God has operated with us, though we were hostile, though we were, I think, in our minds we were engaged in evil deeds, He reconciled us to Himself, and He is going to present us blameless before Him, holy. And now when He says, in here, John chapter 17, "I don't just simply accept your quality. I want to share with you your gift." I don't just accept you. I want you here. To you, for every single Christian, this is the Gospel truth that you have to exercise trust. If you've ever struggled with depression, here is where you exercise faith. "I'm worthless." And your friend is going to come by and say, "No, you're not." Why? Because God said so. Now you have to exercise faith. Are you going to suddenly sit there and say, "No, I am worthless." It doesn't matter what you say. Or are you going to trust God's Word when Jesus says, "I want you here with me." That kind of love from God is crazy, man. It's intense. God is not just simply, like, He's just doing His thing. He saw the corner of His eye that these poor people needed help, so He threw out some change. If that was your concept of the Gospel, incredibly offensive. God says, "When I wanted to love you, I didn't spare myself." I didn't reserve. I didn't put aside some element of my inheritance. I'm giving it to you in full. And I want you to have everything that I have. That's the kind of love we have from God. Now, from this point, what I'd like to say is this, point three. Point one was our identity crisis is an approval problem. Point two is that, but God in His grace has given us this approval. Point three is, we unfortunately have a fallen condition. Where sometimes, we care very little for that approval. What am I saying? Sometimes, even though conceptually we're like, "I get it. It's supposed to be huge. It's supposed to be beyond any other kind of approval or validation I receive." But sometimes we just don't care. Right? What do I mean by that? Why am I saying sometimes we just don't care? I'm going to give you an example, okay? I mean, truthfully speaking, yes. If we ever think about our function, our skill, our appearance, we should be thinking God matters most. His approval of me matters most. His eyes looking at me matters more than your eyes looking at me, right? The only way I'm going to be able to stand up here, even as a pastor, working through all the fears of man, like, "Oh my gosh, is this a good sermon? Oh my gosh, are you falling asleep? Oh my gosh, that guy over there opened his eyes in a while." All those thoughts are running through my head. How am I supposed to overcome that? I'm supposed to get up here and think, "Is my preaching of God's Word approved in His eyes above your eyes?" That's how I'm supposed to get over something. And sometimes it doesn't click like that. It doesn't matter. I'm going to use another silly example. There are many times I just recently went to a retreat because I don't know the context of people's relationships. I don't know what people have gone through. I poke around where I shouldn't be poking around. So one time I saw this, like, two people hanging out, talking to each other. And I was just like, "Hey, are you guys like a thing?" And then they were like, "Uh..." And I was like, "Uh... what was that all about?" And then I realized later on, the girl comes over to me and was like, "Yeah, we just broke up." And I was like, "My fault for asking, right?" And then she revealed to me, like, it was a long relationship. I was like, "How long? Five years?" "What? Oh, gosh!" So yeah, I shouldn't be poking around. Now, the thing about it is, within that time, they have a lot of stuff to work through in terms of the questions. It's not all a waste. The questions, like, why did it not work? In the end, there's another major question. The person didn't want me. Am I not desirable? Am I not, like, good husband material? There's a lot of questions to work through. Now, all of those things, those are actual real questions that you should work through. And you should answer them appropriately and maturely in Christ. But here's where I want to use that example. Because I don't know what to say. It's super awkward, you know? So, as they share with me, like, "It's been five years." I started running through thoughts in my head, like, "Should I ask them?" Like, "Oh, what happened?" And I was like, "I'm not going to ask them what happened. That's just stupid." And I started running through another scenario where I was like, "Oh, you know, the best thing I could think of was just to pat the guy on the back." He's like, "It's okay." So, I don't know what would you have done. Sometimes I'm slow, so I just tap him on the back, like, "It's okay." And I'm like, "Man, I mean, what else could they say?" They're like, "It's okay." It's like, "Shall we go eat?" It's the best thing. Now, imagine. I think I used this as an example in another scenario. But imagine, right? Imagine you were sharing this to me as a pastor. And, you know, you told me, "It was you. You were in a five-year relationship. Clearly, you thought you were going to get married. Otherwise, you would have stayed in there five years. You thought this was going to happen. You thought this was the one. Clearly, you made investments. Clearly, you gave up yourself to some degree, right?" And then it breaks. You're just like, "What in the world? Why?" And you're coming, and you're crying. And you're like, "I don't know how I'm going to get past this. I'm going to be alone for five years." And they feel like they gave up a part of themselves, right? And they almost feel like all future hope is gone because now I'm going to look like damaged bits. Like, what are the girls going to want me after me giving away five years of my life? Those are some of the real questions that get asked, right? Now, imagine. I'm sitting here like a doofus. I don't know what to say to you. So I'm just like, "Okay?" And I put out my arms, and I'm like, "There, there." And I give you a big hug, right? And I just start hugging you. And I start telling you, "It's okay. Pastor Mark loves you. I love you, man." Right? Don't worry. Don't you worry. I'm here for you. Imagine if I did that. You're kind of laughing. It's a silly example. But you would sit there and be like, "I know you're trying to be nice, but this is weird. It's awkward as hell." Right? Why? Let's ask the question, "Why?" Why does that not help? Because you don't want a romantic relationship with me. I'm not the person you're seeking love from. Right? I'm not that person. Okay. This is where the analogy is going to stick. You see, with me, we talked about church. With me, we talked about family problems. With me, we talked about counseling issues. With me, we talked about your hurts and pains. That's the limitation of my relationship. And with me, the relationship, yes, appropriately, wasn't supposed to be this intimate, romantic relationship. Neither was it supposed to be a forever dependent relationship. But my question is, sometimes we feel like when God says, "I love you," we feel like some nice pastor gave us a hug and tapped us on the back and said, "It's okay." My question is, when we hear the words of Christ say, "I love you," why is that not enough? And my question to you is going to be, have you relegated God's amazing approval, qualification, and intense desire to be with you, have you relegated all of that to some kind of pastor's love? My love and God's love is not the same, is it? And you should never put it on the same bar. You shouldn't even put it on the same bar as your own father and mother. God's love supersedes that by so much. Why is it that God's love for you is not enough? And sometimes it feels like a nice pat on the back. That's the question. Because if we were actually seeing Christ's love poured out in John 17, God, with these people, these people who are hurting me and about to hurt me more, these people who are rejecting me and disapproving of me, I want them to be with me like I love you. That's what Christ is saying. And for us to feel like, "Well, Jesus, that's nice." I think that's offensive. I think we're not seeing the picture at all. I just think we don't get it, right? And so my exhortation to you is to point forth. My exhortation to you is we have to be ever-growing in how we appreciate God's desire for you. Because your identity is not just based on your desires. I said that this morning, yes, and it's true. Your identity, a lot of what you desire is going to be telling on you. But your identity as a Christian is more so built by God's desire of you, right? Your identity is not something that you tried so hard to piece together and build, and after 10 years of maturing, now all of a sudden you've built it. A vast and broad majority of your identity is given to you in the moment when God places His loving, intimate knowledge and love upon you. And so the more you appreciate it, the more clearly you understand, "Oh my goodness. I was born. I was wretched, closed, and I was a rotten sack. But God knew me in time. And even though He saw the depths of my sin, even though He saw everything I was thinking, wanting, and desiring, and all of that was wicked, He wanted me. He approved me." That to you is solid. Amen? That to you is a solid, perfect identity given to you by the desire of God. And that's what Scripture says. That's what He wants to do. Everything about your identity is so intricately tied to God's relational love for you. And God so desired that every single piece of you then be perfected, not outside of His love, but within His realm. For example, listen to this, Colossians 2, 9-14. "And in Him all the fullness of the deity dwells." In Jesus Christ, the full Godness. And then He says, "And then so in Him you've been made complete." He is the head over all rule and authority. This piece is so crazy to us. For us as Christians, we are because He is. Because He's holy, we become holy. Because He's loving, we become holy. We become loving. Everything apart from Him is nothing. Everything with Him is everything. Because He's risen, we have resurrected life. Because He's set apart all of these things, because He is, we are. And God says our identity then should be made complete in Christ. And what's more, when I look at the various perspectives of the apostles, they are very clear upon the gospel. The gospel is not so much me, just changing my desires. The gospel is me being desired by God. For example, I want to read to you a passage, just jot this down for reference. 1 Corinthians 8. 1 Corinthians 8. The scripture says this, "Now concerning being sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. If anyone supposes he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know." Now listen to this, it says, "But if anyone loves God, he is known by God." Known by God. What's more, Galatians chapter 4 verses 8-9 says, "However, at that time when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather, to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things of the world?" It's crazy. Paul says in Galatians 4-8, he says, "Before you were slaves, now you've come to know God." Well actually, let me correct myself, "Now you've come to be known by God." The gospel is about you being known, and desired, and approved by God. That's how it is. And what I'd like to do for you now, as we think about this identity, I'm going to challenge you. Whether you see it or not, every single one of us wrestles with the fear of man. Wrestles with wanting approval from the people around us. I wrestle with it all the time, I know you guys wrestle with it to some degree. Anytime you are wanting to perform before your superiors, every time you are trying to be seen in a good light by the people who are important to you, you are going to wrestle. Is it always altogether 100% sinful? No. The temptation is right there. Let me explain that for you a little bit. You see, if, so this is the last portion, last point five. If, as a warning to you, you seek the approval of man, you are going to be weak. By nature of the game, if you are susceptible to the approval of man, you are weak. Why? Because you are going to be full of fear, you are going to be insecure, you are going to be subject to manipulation, and you will absolutely lose yourself. You don't have to jot all that down, but I think you know what I mean. If you are subject to the fear of man, you cannot even come to church. Why? Because you feel judged. The eyes of all the people around you, these holy people, it's too much to bear. You can't even walk into church with a clear conscience. If you are subject to the fear of man, you are going to be so, so easily manipulated. You're going to be insecure. Let me give you a silly example. There was one time, there was a lady at our church who were training these, the dogs, assistance dogs, I forget what they're called, for the handicapped individuals. Oh, you guys know what I'm talking about? Service dogs, thank you. Okay, service dogs. And there was this beautiful laughter, it was black, it was cute, and I was like, "Man, I'm not an animal person, but that dog is awesome!" It was just sitting there throughout the whole church service. She would bring that dog to everything she went. And it took it to the middle of the line, all over the church service, but that dog was unnoticeable. It just sat there. And so I went over and I just started praising the lady. I was like, "You must be the best trainer ever!" And she said, "Nah, it's just because this dog is so easy to train." I was like, "But really, why?" "Because this dog loves treats." And I went, "Doo!" I was like, "Doo!" Not her, but I was just like, "That's what Satan does!" This is what Satan does to you. When you're hungry for approval, all I have to do is do this in the past. Come. When you have the full approval, affection, qualification, and justification of God, you're full. You're absolutely full. And no amount of little manipulation, little treats can make you be like, "Yes, they are!" You're not going to get over there just trying to get that little, little approval, a little crown, little jewel, little treat, just because you're hungry. Why? You're full. You're absolutely full. But if you seek the approval of man, that's what you will be. And what's more, you're going to absolutely lose all your sense of security. You're going to lose your sense of identity. The Apostle Paul says it again, Galatians 1, 8-10, where he says this, "For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God? Am I still striving to please men? If I were still striving to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ." Absolutely lose all that. Honestly speaking, if you guys have ever struggled with insecurity, that's something to really wrestle with. Don't sit there trying to validate your insecurity. "Oh, it's because that guy makes me feel insecure." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your insecurity comes from fear. "I'm going to be disapproved." That fear comes from your deep-rooted desire. "I have to have approval." And what that's going to make you do is you're going to lose yourself. You're going to lose your friends. And eventually, you're going to lose your voice. The Apostle Paul says very clearly, "I can't even talk about Christ if I'm sitting here trying to seek the approval of man or God." And so I want to conclude with this today's sermon. Your identity, your identity is so wrapped up in, yes, your desire, but also God's desire. And so what you see is a two-way road of your relationship with Christ. And what we need to do, earlier in the previous sermon, I said, "Stop, please cease and desist from trying to secure your own." Here and now, I'm going to challenge you. Have you, by faith, really accepted that Christ has approved you? Have you fully put out your hand and embraced that God has called you to? And then is your heart, your stomach, and your mind, and your heart so full, "God wants to be with me. God wants to be with me. Do I need the love of everybody else? Do I need everyone's examination and then approval? I'm full. I'm absolutely satisfied." This is the thing in the heart that's going to be so powerful. This is what you need to grow, and that is an exercise in love. Let's take a moment.</p></div></body></html>
