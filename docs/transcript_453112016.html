I've been at Berean for six years now and I'm part of the family ministry here and married to a beautiful woman named Elise who I also met at Berean. I grew up with faithful Christian parents who have always taught me and my two older sisters the importance of believing in the Lord and they have always been my role models in the faith. Although I would say I was generally an obedient kid growing up, early on I became aware I was a pretty terrible sinner and I would often feel guilty of the disconnect I felt between the ongoing sinful desires I had in my heart and the good Christian boy I was supposed to be. At a retreat in middle school I remember the pastor shared and outlined the gospel on the last night and invited us to repent and to surrender our lives to Jesus and recognize him as Savior and Lord. I believe God revealed to me that night that I was a great sinner in need of a great Savior and so I asked for forgiveness of my sins and I committed my life to Christ. Fast forward many years later, I came to Berean after I graduated college on a recommendation from a friend. It was the first time I was at a church that taught the Bible verse by verse and it was refreshing to be a part to be part of a church where there was an evident desire to seek and know God through his word. Before coming out I struggled a lot with complacency and although complacency remains an ongoing challenge I think coming out to Berean has had a profound impact on my spiritual growth. I am grateful for the many people God placed in my life here at Berean to spur me on to seriously fight against serious sins, to remind me of the hope and victory and peace that is found in Christ alone and to point me back to the joy in choosing Christ over the desires of the world. Fast forward now on my decision to get baptized through immersion. I grew up in the Presbyterian church and was infant baptized and confirmed. Although I believe I was already saved before my confirmation, as I examined now what scripture says on the subject, I believe I was not baptized in the ways the Bible describes baptism. There is no power in the water to save us from our sins, that's only possible through Jesus' death on the cross. Nevertheless, the Bible seems to say a great deal about baptism, which means it must be important. As a Christian who strives to be obedient, it would also be important for me to understand it and practice it according to what I see in scripture, as with all things. So with that, I have never had the privilege to partake in the sacrament as a symbol to be united with Christ in his death and in his resurrection, and it is with great joy I am able to do it now. To conclude, I am thankful for the new life he has given me, and there is truly nothing that surpasses the great treasure in knowing Christ, Jesus' Lord. He has been so faithful to hold me fast when I am weak, and I trust he will continue to be faithful in shepherding me to follow in his footsteps. There are still many times when I am so discouraged by my sin, but I am reminded of God's enduring love and abundant mercies. He is truly worthy of all worship. I will close with Romans 6.4. We are buried, therefore, with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the death by the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life. Thank you. Isaac, do you understand that when you're going into the water, you're united with Christ in his death, and when you come out, you're being united with Christ in his resurrected life? Yes, I do. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (water pouring) (audience applauding) (applause)</p></div></body></html>
