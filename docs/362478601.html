href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=119s">00:01:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I already put it into chunks for you, but a good practice is to make sure that as we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=124s">00:02:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding the flow of thought, to summarize what those chunks are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=129s">00:02:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now one of the easiest ways to do that is just to make sure we look at the sentences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=134s">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as a complete package.</span></div><div

work in you, both to will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=157s">00:02:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and to work for his good pleasure."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=159s">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=160s">00:02:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm going to say is that as we take a look at that sentence as a whole, you take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=166s">00:02:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a look at the main, main command or the main verb in that sentence, and it's the command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=171s">00:02:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to work out your salvation.</span></div><div

front.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=177s">00:02:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you will prove yourself to be blameless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and innocent, children of God above reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=188s">00:03:08.040</a></span> | <span

summarize as do all without grumbling or disputing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=197s">00:03:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Ha ha ha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=198s">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=199s">00:03:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Just making sure you're paying attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=200s">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=201s">00:03:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=202s">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 17 through 18, he says that, you know, "Do this so that in the day of Christ I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=208s">00:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have reason to glory, because I do not run in vain or toil in vain, but even if I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=213s">00:03:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">being poured out as a drink offering upon sacrifice in service of your faith, I rejoice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=219s">00:03:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and share my joy with you all."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=221s">00:03:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that phrase, "I rejoice and share my joy," is the main clause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=225s">00:03:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that second part in verse 18, that is actually a command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=229s">00:03:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It is in the imperative form, "You too, I urge you, rejoice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=233s">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the command is there, "You rejoice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=236s">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says, "Share your joy with me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=237s">00:03:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I summarized it as, "I rejoice, you rejoice, we all rejoice for ice cream."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=242s">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=243s">00:04:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Not for ice cream, but for the sake of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=245s">00:04:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=246s">00:04:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I want to highlight this just a little bit as good practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=249s">00:04:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to take a whole lot, but typically when I read a passage, I read through it multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=254s">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">times before I make the outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=255s">00:04:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=257s">00:04:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes the act of trying to summarize it to the core point is difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=264s">00:04:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you find that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=273s">00:04:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, out of the main point out of the sentence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=276s">00:04:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And how you do that is you realize certain phrases cannot stand alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/362478601#t=280s">00:04:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">If I read to you, "So then, my beloved, just as you have always
