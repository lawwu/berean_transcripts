href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=141">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were a very young church and there's no way anybody in their right mind would plant</span></div><div

our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=155">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">typically when you plant the church, you know, you plan and you have, you know, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=161">00:02:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the core members that you get together,

things are planned and then you execute and you hope to reach these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=173">00:02:53.800</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=178">00:02:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever you plant something, you make sure that you got the soil ready, you got</span></div><div

sun and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=186">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you get enough rays and then you go and check up on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=188">00:03:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, none of that happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=189">00:03:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like for us, our church plant was kind of like taking a seed and just throwing it out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=193">00:03:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the window and then expecting it to die and then on the way back, we realized, "Huh, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=199">00:03:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't die."</span></div><div

church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=204">00:03:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we got planted out of necessity, just not trying to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=209">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That was really the early parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=210">00:03:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And first year that we had our church retreat was about six years into the church because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=216">00:03:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, obviously I was busy taking care of our family and I had to get an extra job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=220">00:03:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay for bills because the church couldn't sustain us in the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=224">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for the first six to seven years, we were really just on a survival mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=229">00:03:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a running joke in the church that whenever one person visited our church, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=234">00:03:54.160</a></span> | <span

class="t">And then even our name was weird, Berean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=240">00:04:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they would say, "Oh, Korean."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=242">00:04:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, Berean."</span></div><div

how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=261">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">many times we thought we're not going to make

href="https://www.vimeo.com/512312282&t=272">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the totality, 24 years looking back, obviously God's hand was upon it.</span></div><div class="c"><span
