Jesus curses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=199s">00:03:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a fig tree while on his way toward

he overturns tables, chases away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=212s">00:03:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the money changers, drives away those selling doves, and then he gets into it with the religious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=217s">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span

physically in people's ways so that they can't carry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=226s">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">merchandise

animated we have ever seen Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=234s">00:03:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesus curses the fig

which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=258s">00:04:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">despite its religious activity, it's really an outlaw's

holy sacrifice, but in reality it was barren</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=271s">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of anything of worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=274s">00:04:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take a look at Mark's account together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=277s">00:04:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be reading Mark 11, 15 to 19 for you, and it's up on the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=285s">00:04:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=289s">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=294s">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and the seats of those who were selling doves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=297s">00:04:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=302s">00:05:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And he began to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=308s">00:05:08.600</a></span> | <span

this and began seeking how to destroy him, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=323s">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they were afraid of him, for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838#t=329s">00:05:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And when
