on this yesterday, and so each evening this week we will be meeting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=57">00:00:57.160</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=64">00:01:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The Passion Week, which means the week of his sufferings, is the most important week</span></div><div

on the earth, but nearly half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=84">00:01:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of all the gospel accounts are devoted to the events and the teachings of just this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=89">00:01:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">single week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=92">00:01:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">During this week, most all things public – Christ's teachings, confrontations with religious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=98">00:01:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">leaders, and the events surrounding his trial – they all take place in Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=105">00:01:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But after each day, Jesus and his disciples, they walk about two miles and return to Bethany,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=112">00:01:52.120</a></span> | <span

Bethany to Jerusalem, Jerusalem to Bethany, Bethany to Jerusalem, and much teaching happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=123">00:02:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to and from, and also on the road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=127">00:02:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the physical setting of this week – Bethany to Jerusalem, back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=134">00:02:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a week in which we also see a lot of Jesus' emotions.</span></div><div

more amazement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=147">00:02:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">from Jesus than either weeping or

emotion as Jesus heads toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=159">00:02:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the cross.</span></div><div

weep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=167">00:02:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">over and what we see him rage over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=170">00:02:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can observe a lot of what a person loves and what a person hates by outbursts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=177">00:02:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of these emotions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=179">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And on Monday, Jesus is visibly very upset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=186">00:03:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are two major things that Scripture points us to that take place on Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=191">00:03:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is the only miracle of destruction in the gospel accounts, where Jesus curses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=199">00:03:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a fig tree while on his way toward Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=204">00:03:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is Jesus causing a scene in the temple where he overturns tables, chases away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=212">00:03:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the money changers, drives away those selling doves, and then he gets into it with the religious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=217">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span

physically in people's ways so that they can't carry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=226">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">merchandise through the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=228">00:03:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is possibly the most physically animated we have ever seen Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=234">00:03:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesus curses the fig tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=237">00:03:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus disrupts business at the temple.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=242">00:04:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is a connection between these two events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=245">00:04:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The curse of the fig tree is a symbol of God's judgment on the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=250">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The leafy fig tree, with all its promise of fruit, is as deceptive as the temple, which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=258">00:04:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">despite its religious activity, it's really an outlaw's hideout, a robber's den.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=265">00:04:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It had the appearance of fruitfulness, of holy sacrifice, but in reality it was barren</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=271">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of anything of worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=274">00:04:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take a look at Mark's account together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=277">00:04:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be reading Mark 11, 15 to 19 for you, and it's up on the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=285">00:04:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=289">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=294">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and the seats of those who were selling doves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=297">00:04:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=302">00:05:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And he began to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=308">00:05:08.600</a></span> | <span

it a robber's den."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=317">00:05:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking how to destroy him, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=323">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they were afraid of him, for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=329">00:05:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And when

we see Jesus alluding to two Old Testament prophecies, Isaiah 56,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/531040838&t=340">00:05:40.640</a></span> | <span
