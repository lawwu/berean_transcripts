href="https://www.vimeo.com/253925588#t=180s">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And to offer our physical body as a living sacrifice, first and foremost, happens in</span></div><div

verses 3 and 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253925588#t=200s">00:03:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the verses 9 through 21, he's giving us that if we are to live our lives, the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253925588#t=207s">00:03:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">gifts that he's given us,

the explanation of biblical love that needs to be the foundation and the motivation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253925588#t=218s">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the fuel that causes us to be able to live a life worthy of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span

I don't think I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253925588#t=270s">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">remind you just how important and
