If you look at the end of the class number one, the lecture, you're going to see at the very end of each lecture a place where all the homework is listed out. So that should be comprehensive at the end of each lecture.</p><p>But beyond that, when you come in every week, you are going to have a short five-minute quiz as well. And the purpose of the quiz is just for accountability's sake. So have fun with it. We're going to take the quizzes. We are going to switch papers and grade each other and have that extra form of accountability of shame.</p><p>That's all going to be there. But all in all, the quizzes are going to be based on homework and lecture. And it's going to be big. It's going to be big category headings and things like that. So you don't have to study an hour for it. If you're doing that, you're probably studying a little bit too much.</p><p>But you want to get the general principles that are flowing out of all of the things. I did an evaluation thing with the previous class. And they told me which ones were headings. Sure. Yeah. Can always be close. So-- and the memory verses are pretty short. I know a lot of you are memorizing through books right now, the Bible.</p><p>And so it might feel like a lot. But it is required. The memory verses are going to be required. Because when you're evangelizing, if you're not using scripture, not that you should feel any less about it, but it enhances your ability to evangelize a lot. When you have scripture at the tip of your tongue, and you see-- even for yourself, even if you don't say it, the verse, even for yourself to understand that the authority of scripture is backing you rather than Christian principles, it's very important.</p><p>So please do memorize those. OK. So before we get into class one, are there any basic logistical questions? Everyone's good? I feel like we need to do an icebreaker, but we don't have time to. It's kind of frigid in here. There's 15-- wait, 15? Yeah, we have 15 married people in here, seven college students and seven bammers.</p><p>That's kind of the breakdown of our class here. So get to know each other, I guess. After class ends, you guys can kind of talk to each other or whatever. So yeah, I'm excited for this. If there are no other questions, we'll begin. Is the store still open? Hello.</p><p>Hi. Oh, Christine, you want to grab this one? OK. All right, so lesson number one, there's going to be six lessons total. The middle four is just simple gospel. Hi. Hey, guys. OK, cool. The simple gospel presentation. And then the first one is going to be on the motivation behind it.</p><p>And then the last lesson is going to be on methodologies. Probably around week four or five, we're going to start doing a little bit of role play, too, kind of pairing off and having you guys evangelize to each other. And you're going to be taking on a different religion.</p><p>So the one that's being evangelized to is going-- so we're going to be kind of doing all these little things in between. So no, there's going to be some interaction. But this one is going to be purely, I'm going to be talking at you today. So this is the motivation for evangelism.</p><p>So if you look at that introduction, what are your personal feelings about evangelism, please check any that apply to you. Can you go ahead and do that in the next 30 seconds? This is just for you. You're not going to be sharing this or anything. Sometimes being aware of this, of something you checked off, is helpful.</p><p>Just being aware that, man, I'm pretty timid. You know that about yourself, but just be aware of it. Bring it into awareness. And then you can use that to say, how can I attack that? As we go out evangelizing together, I hope that we can do this. So our mission, God's purpose.</p><p>My first quote here is, "Evangelism is to Christianity what veins are to our bodies. You can cut Christianity anywhere, and it will bleed evangelism. Evangelism is vascular. It's our business. Talk about majoring on evangelism, you might as well talk about a doctor majoring on healing. That's our business." Man by the name of Bass Harner at the Moody Bible Institute.</p><p>So these are a couple of the questions that we're going to be tackling. How do we gain motivation to evangelize? And secondly, how should we motivate others to evangelize? Now, the motivation behind evangelism has to be step one here. It has to be. Because we know that we ought to be evangelizing, and your answer can be quite different from everybody else in this room too.</p><p>But our motivation has to be on the same heartbeat here, on the same track. So going into some of the false motivations here, there are temporary manipulations. So the first one is a sob story. A dying friend in your arms, if you only had one more minute to share the gospel.</p><p>So that can feel like a motivation. And many of us maybe have felt that with a family member who's in the hospital. And that motivation has a good end to it, but it could have a wrong beginning to it. Because this person is dying, and if you are so just taken captive by that thought, he's dying, he needs to hear the gospel.</p><p>That sounds really good. But that can't be the beginning motivation. It is always, and we're going to see, it is always going to be a desire for God, his glory, his kingdom, his renown, his fame. It's always going to be that. And so while these things are very important, like he's dying, that has to fall under the category of who God is and why it's so important that we're preaching him.</p><p>So we're going to try to do that. The second one, cancer story. You have the cure to cancer, and you've withheld it. You're a terrible person. And so you've heard that before maybe in your life, right? We're Christians. We have the cure to cancer. How dare you? How dare you hold that to yourself?</p><p>That's a wrong motivation. There's truth behind it, of course. We ought to be asking ourselves, how can we be so selfish with this message? But if that is the motivation, that can be a temporary manipulation of your own heart and of your own desires. So here are some of the-- here's a quote by John MacArthur here.</p><p>"Any manipulation in evangelism may produce short-term results, but in the long run, becomes a barrier to genuine belief." So when you're motivated by these temporary manipulations, many times the content of the message that you're portraying begins to change as well. Because you're starting with this person and wanting this person saved, you begin to-- without even thinking about it, you can go a little bit secret sensitive in there.</p><p>It just starts to happen. But when your motivation is rock solid, when it's on God and who he is, and your desire for him to be made known, then everything, again, begins to fall into place. So here's some lasting motivations, God's purposes. Mission statements are statements to govern your approach in life.</p><p>So many companies have this. Many people who are kind of driven make mission statements for their own lives. I've never really done it before. But mission statements are helpful to identify at least some things. It helps you make decisions. It helps you establish your values. It helps you direct where to spend your time and money.</p><p>It helps you know what and why of your to-dos. And so for the Christian, our mission statement is biblical. And I do believe that our-- if you were at the members meeting yesterday, our vision for this year is very much our mission statement, to know God and to make him known.</p><p>So that's what we're doing. If you turn to the next page, what is the mission statement that God presents to us in scripture? This one, please read this on your own. But this is the Bible survey for a mission of God. This is that idea that God is a missionary God.</p><p>And he desires-- all through the course of scripture, you're going to see that he was very, very consumed-- you can say jealous for his glory. And that is seen in his desire for missions then to happen in the people of God. So read that on your own. Some of this stuff might be on the quiz, so it just adds up for you.</p><p>So nothing so much glorifies God as his gracious redemption of damned, hell-bound sinners. Fellowship, teaching, and praise are not the mission of the church, but are rather the preparation of the church to fulfill its mission of winning the lost. That's by John MacArthur. Take a look at that. So God is glorified in the redemption of damned, hell-bound sinners.</p><p>But look at this. Fellowship, teaching, and praise are not the mission of the church. They are not the mission of the church, but they prepare the church to fulfill its mission of winning the lost. We're very familiar with the fact that when we one day die, we're going to be brought into perfect worship before God, perfect fellowship before God and one another.</p><p>So why would we work so hard here? Well, there's an aspect of it. We're living out our identity. But also, that is our testimony to the world, by our love for one another. And so God's goals-- do I not have these? No, that's OK. God's goals, it's reconciliation of rebellious sinners with the Holy God.</p><p>This time period where sinful man walks this earth, it's reconciliation of rebellious sinners with the Holy God. And secondly, to present every person complete in Christ, to present every person complete in Christ. So here's our motivation. So in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 15, Emily, do you think you could read that for us?</p><p>For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people, you increase thanksgiving to the glory of God. This is our passion. And this is a question you have to ask yourself. Is this your passion? It doesn't take long to take a cursory glance at your checkbook, at the way you spend your time, to prove whether you believe this truly or not.</p><p>So there's a difference, remember, between the idea of faith without works. The belief needs to be able to produce the fruit of that belief. And the fruit of the belief proves the faith or the belief. We understand that. And so we will all say we live to the glory of God, but you have to look at what you've been producing in your life.</p><p>How you've been spending your free time, how you've been-- what you've been thinking about when you wake up, what has been the thing that's been bringing you most joy. Does that all line up together? Is it God's glory? Roman number one, if you are concerned with magnifying the glory of God, there is a simple biblical mathematical equation.</p><p>More people saved equals more people giving glory to God. So this is an obvious byproduct. If you desire God's glory truly, then you are going to desire God's glory truly in other people as well. So if you are jealous for God's glory yourself, then when you see people who are walking around as robbers of God's glory, it drives you crazy.</p><p>There's something that feels off about that. And your motivation isn't on this person is dying and going to hell, so much as-- there's that compassion that's there, as the first step is, man, I need God to be made known in this person's life. And a lot of what falls under that becomes, I want them to know God's love.</p><p>I want them to understand God's compassion and kindness and grace. But it does not start there. And we're going to talk about that, especially next week when we talk about God's holiness. Christine, can you read for us that quote by MacArthur? "When we worship God, by proclaiming his glory and his clarity, Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did with you." 2 Thessalonians 3, 1.</p><p>"When his word is given exposure, when people hear it and are saved, God is glorified." God is glorified. I hope when we're evangelizing to people, that's what's on our minds, God's glory. So we'll get into why this matters so much. Ariel, can you read the J.I. Packer quote? "We glorify God by evangelizing, not only because evangelizing is an act of obedience, but also because in evangelism, we tell the world what great things God has done for the salvation of sinners.</p><p>God is glorified when his mighty works of grace are made known." OK, great. So that book was actually out there yesterday, J.I. Packer, "Eve and the Sovereignty of God." And so I think if you still want to purchase those, I'm sure they're available. Maybe you could talk to June or something.</p><p>All right. So Roman numeral number two here, "Because the Lord is worthy of glory, we must evangelize." So there's our motivation for evangelism. We evangelize because we are captivated by God's glory. We want that so badly. And that's real for us. So we can't go out there trying to convince ourselves that we're about God's glory.</p><p>We need to already be about that in our everyday living. So that's our passion, our heart, love, and obedience. Roman numeral one, "Believers are motivated by understanding Christ's command." Agnes, can you read for us John 14, 15? "If you love me, you will keep my commandments." So simple. "If you love me, you will keep my commandments." And then 1 John 5, 3, let's go back to Alyssa.</p><p>"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome." And then Charlotte, the next one. "Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." So if you're thinking about your heart, yes, we go out of a love for Christ.</p><p>But the love obedience factor comes together. Many times, remembering that you need to obey is very helpful in evangelism. Because our love many times isn't Christ. So when we have a co-worker and we know we should be evangelizing, but we feel nervous to or feel like, oh, maybe later, or I'm going to let my life evangelize, or we make all these excuses, it's because you are in love with yourself.</p><p>You love yourself. You love how you're perceived, and how you're seen, and your comfort. But love is going to produce obedience. These are both ends. We're going to go out there. And sometimes, you know, our spectrum-- June, where are we going, by the way? Oh, UTC. When we're out at UTC, that obedience thing is very helpful to remember.</p><p>And I love Jesus. And so I'm going to go as nerve wracking as it might be. So the Lord has commanded that we evangelize the world. Because we love the Lord, we must obey. Roman numeral number two. If the purposes of God and a desire to obey Christ do not motivate you to evangelize, you may have a greater fear of man than God.</p><p>Perhaps you are greatly afraid of being rejected by man. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verse 10, it says, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</p><p>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men." The "we persuade men" is-- the knowing is a participle to the "we persuade men" indicative. The persuading men is contingent on this knowing the fear of the Lord. They're running together here. So therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men.</p><p>We are not out there to persuade men, just like that. But because of our fear of God. But we are made manifest to God. And I hope that we are made manifest also in your conscience. So what motivates you? Fear of man or fear of God? In Galatians 1, 6, "I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel, which is really not another.</p><p>Only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed. As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you've received, he is to be accursed." Here it is, verse 10.</p><p>"For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still striving to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ." If you don't have a desire to obey Christ, you might be motivated by a fear of man or having a different fear other than God.</p><p>There's a few more here in Proverbs 29 and John 14. You can look at those on your own. Better be. Here's another reason why. You might not have a pattern of applying God's word. Or you have a pattern of not applying God's word. So if you're wondering, why am I not in obedience?</p><p>There's the fear of man and the non-fear of God at play. But there's also this thing of maybe you're just simple, just not applying what you're reading. Because you are regularly exposed, but you do not apply the word, your heart is becoming indifferent. This is so scary. If you're in a regular habit of reading scripture and yet not applying-- so if you read every day for the next year and yet not applying, you are at risk of becoming indifferent in your heart.</p><p>Christ commands or commands for you, but you have gotten into a pattern of seeing them as directed at the general church, but maybe not to you. And so we're able to sit-- like when we get together and we say, what have you been reading? What have you been learning?</p><p>You can say it. But only what you've been applying actually matters. And this is just my opinion, I think. But only what you've been applying is actually something I think you should be sharing that you've been learning this. So if you're giving concepts about how we should be, there's a lot of-- it could be laced with a lot of judgment, actually.</p><p>So many of you might know, there are people who are reading and learning and growing a lot in the knowledge of God, and yet they're not applying. And so when their sermons are being aimed at them, what are they doing? They're thinking of John and Hannah, and they're not thinking of themselves.</p><p>And this is the danger of that. I think the people who are most walking and abiding in Christ are the ones who are the most-- when they're hearing sermons, they could be the most mature of Christians, and they could be the most basic of sermons, and yet you are struck to the heart.</p><p>I've heard some people who are just walking so well with Christ that they heard the most basic of sermons, and they come up, and they're just so broken. And you're like, no, that's such a basic Bible thing. But that's what happened. OK, moving on. Our evangelism is God-centered. So these big categories we're hitting here-- our passion, our heart, our evangelism-- probably going to be on the quiz.</p><p>So our evangelism is God-centered. Roman numeral 1-- what does it mean to evangelize? So we're going to go into a little bit of Greek here. The first one, "uangelizo," preach the good news. Oh, when you see a double G like that, by the way, this is just FYI. We have an NG sound in there, that "ng" sound in there.</p><p>So "uangelizo," preach the good news. Preach the good news. So in Acts 8.35-- let's keep going here. Going over to Frank. Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, he preached Jesus to them. Great. And then 1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4, you're going to see another instance of this word, preaching the good news.</p><p>So there is this aspect of that, that we go to preach it. But there's another one called "didasko," teach the good news. This goes into teaching and instruction with illustration and producing understanding. So there is a biblical difference between preaching and teaching. Andy, can you read for us Acts 5.42?</p><p>Every day he'd go from-- how's teaching and preaching? There it is. So there's something. So he labels and puts them side by side. So a lot of what we do on Wednesday nights right now or at our home groups is probably more in lines of teaching. There are instances where Pastor Mark will be moved by the Spirit, and he'll just start preaching.</p><p>And you kind of feel that. But teaching is to really produce understanding. And it feels like there's a different purpose in it sometimes. Acts 15.35, going back to Jason. "But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching with many others also the word of the Lord." OK, great.</p><p>And then next, another word when we think of evangelism is "keruso," to herald the gospel or to proclaim, to invite to fellowship. So look at the nuances of each of those things. To herald the gospel-- this is the man who came before and preceded the king. And he would trumpet and say, someone is coming.</p><p>And sometimes he would give the report of the king before the king would actually even come. This is what the king is going to talk about. It's like an outline. He'd say, these are the things he's coming for. And the king is going to come, and then he'll do his thing.</p><p>This is Mark 5.20. Sorry, I actually printed out for you guys an unedited copy. That's Mark chapter 5, verse 20. And then, June, can you read that for us? "And he went away and began to proclaim into capitalists what great things Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed." That word there is "proclaim." So it is this idea of proclamation of God, that we are heralding him.</p><p>And in many ways, to kind of complete the image of the herald, it was an invitation. So the herald would come to make everyone come out of their homes. So when we're going out with the gospel, we're preaching, we're teaching. But also, there is this aspect of invitation that we're doing in the gospel.</p><p>So if you're going, and you're talking to someone, and you're just like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, and then you leave, right? In your heart, are you really inviting them? Like, come. Like, taste and see that the Lord is good. Like what it says in Isaiah 55, come and drink of the wine that you did not purchase, the milk that comes freely to you.</p><p>And eat of the bread that you have no reason to have. This is an attractive message. And then, letter D, martyreo, this is witness, one who gives knowledge, confirmation, or light. One who gives knowledge, confirmation, or light. Sean, do you think you can read for us Galatians, please? Sure.</p><p>Galatians 4.15 and 16. "Where then is that sense of blessing you have, for I bear you witness that, if possible, you have plucked out of your eyes and given them to me. So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?" OK. So this idea of witness, for I bear you witness that that word, if you look at the word martyreo, you see the word martyr hidden in there.</p><p>And it is the same word. It's the exact same word, actually. So when we're called witnesses, or even the word testimony, it actually is the word for murder. That the testimony that we're giving is our life. And by giving our testimony, we're saying that our life is wrapped up in this, and that we will lose our life for this.</p><p>So that idea of witness is found in scripture as well. So we must speak and communicate a distinct message. All of these terms refer to the-- this is verbal communication. Verbal communication, or transmission of the gospel. So just as God revealed truth to us, we have to reveal truth to the unsaved.</p><p>In redemptive history, the mysteries of God were not incomprehensible anomalies. They were truths known only to God, but now revealed. In order to truly evangelize, we must speak the message of God. So all four of those do require verbal communication. There is a fallacy of lifestyle evangelism that probably pervades the church, where you think that just by the way I live, hopefully they will come to know Christ.</p><p>Or you're hoping that they will ask you. It's not wrong. It's helpful. But I'm going to tell you straight up, that's not evangelism. It's OK to do, and it is actually very beneficial to do. And we should all be having an idea of our lifestyles preaching something, but it is not evangelism.</p><p>So don't let the sinful part of your heart-- you know, the Jeremiah 17, 9, the hardest deceitful part-- trick you into thinking that maybe this is some form of evangelism. It is not. You are not obeying the command to evangelize when you're just hoping that your lifestyle communicates something.</p><p>OK. Where are we here? OK. Oh, good. We're making good time. So again, this is the most heavy in terms of just getting a lot of stuff out there. Roman numeral 2 here, what makes evangelism God-centered? This is another read on your own thing. I don't have the read on your own things very often in this class, but there was just so much material.</p><p>This was actually a 10-week course when I first started it, and then crunched it down to six. So this is just really good. If you look at it, you're going to see, man, am I really focused on the right motivation? And if you look down the left column versus the right column, this is a very challenging thing.</p><p>Like, you're going to see yourself, man, I've been kind of given to this left side that kind of naturally-- like, we have a man-centered approach to evangelism. We love talking about God's chief attribute of love, the point of contact. What do we start off with in our point of contact?</p><p>Do we have this idea of man is sick and ignorant? I thought the outreach team did a great job just very, very in a short amount of time to sharing what is the beginning point in many of these, and why is it that we need to be trained in preaching the gospel, not because we don't know the gospel, but because many times our motivation in the gospel is wrong.</p><p>And so it starts off wrong, and honestly speaking, many times we don't even get to the heart of it. So we start it off wrong with right material, and because it stops at a certain point, the right material with the wrong starting point produces a complete false gospel. If you're able to continue that message, it's OK to start in different places.</p><p>So that's a lot of what we're going to talk about. There's going to be four things that we go over the next four weeks, which is God, man, Jesus, us. But you don't need to go in that order. In everyday conversation, they might bring up something about Jesus dying on the cross, and you might start there.</p><p>But you have to come back to God being holy and creator. And so you might feel like, hey, I confess that Jesus is Lord yesterday. You might start there, that someone randomly said that because they went out to harvest crusade or something, but you got to get back to the gospel and make sure that all points are hit.</p><p>I start a lot of times with man being sinful, not even God being holy or creator. I start a lot of times with man being sinful. But you have to go back to these things. So the thing is, if we're starting in these places and we never get to the crux of the gospel, we do a big disservice to him.</p><p>That's why I think a lot of testimonies that I receive, even from Christians, because we're very man-centered naturally, I see testimonies that say, I was depressed and lonely and lost, and God came and saved me. Is that truth? Oh, absolutely. Me too. But is that what he came to save us from?</p><p>No. That was the result of my sin. He did not come to save me from depression and loneliness. Honestly, you deserve to be lonely and depressed and all that. That kind of stuff came out-- sometimes I'm talking to younger students. And I actually talked to a youth student this past-- our church's youth retreat.</p><p>And then they're saying, yeah, I'm struggling with depression, and this is hard, and these are the reasons why. But God brings comfort into my heart. And I was staring at him. And I was like, but you know what? Honestly, I don't want God to comfort you in that place.</p><p>I don't think that's what he's doing. Actually, I think you're living in sin. And that kind of thing is self-produced. And so a lot of our evangelism, you have to ask yourself, is it God-centered or is it man-centered? It's very tempting to be man-centered. Someone might break down in front of you crying, because they feel like their life is just so hard.</p><p>And in that place, you might say, but God came to save you from that. It's so tempting to be man-centered, because there is an iota of truth in there. But God did not come to save them from just that darkness. You have to kind of clump these things together.</p><p>That is a result of your sin. That is what God came to save you from. He cannot just pluck you out of your darkness. You need to surrender and repent before him of your sin. And only in that place, you'll produce true joy, true peace, true happiness. OK, so going to the next page here.</p><p>Where am I? Did I go off script? Evangelism God-centered. Did I go in order? Did I skip a page? I'm in order, right? We're on page six right now? Is this thing on page six? No, it's not. That's page four. This is page four? Oopsies. Sorry. What makes-- God's message.</p><p>Are we back on track now? Where am I? You're right. Oh, OK. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. OK. OK, here we go. God-centered EV must be dedicated to accuracy in presenting God's revelation. So let's preach God's message. And then, therefore, we do not measure evangelism by how did they feel after they listened, or how did I feel after I shared.</p><p>How many are attending my church now as a result? We ask the question instead, was the message of Christ proclaimed and laid upon the unbeliever to believe? Did you preach and teach? Did you proclaim? Did you invite? The gospel-- via the gospel. And nothing else matters after that. You can feel rotten because they yelled in your face after you preached the gospel.</p><p>And yet, God is smiling. You can go about it and say, man, they left and they were angry. Or they just look uncomfortable. The entire time I'm saying something, they just look uncomfortable. And you're like, oh, man, I don't feel good about this. And yet, I'll say, man, that was faithful preaching of God's word.</p><p>That was great evangelism. God well-- no, God well-- job well done. We did something dumb in the college ministry. It's like this idea of when can you do the victory dance? And then they start boomeranging. They would go and preach the gospel. It was helpful because I think a lot of them, as they would come out, they'd be discouraged.</p><p>And then the two of them would look at each other and say, hey, did we preach the gospel, though? Were we faithful in presenting who God is to them? And were our hearts all in it? And do we care about this person? It's like, yeah. Then we feel kind of junkier now.</p><p>And they walked away, and we probably ruined their day. And yet, you could do the victory dance in that. This was good. This was so good. Now, let's go do that again. That's going to happen. You're going to be out at UTC, and someone's just going to be so uncomfortable.</p><p>And you're going to be uncomfortable because they're uncomfortable. And yet, your vision, your whole window, is it being taken up by this person? Or is it completely filled by the vision of who God is? And so they're uncomfortable, but it doesn't change you even one bit. You're just like, you're going because of it.</p><p>Number two, God-centered EV must be holistic in preaching the biblical worldview and not necessarily exhaustive. Very, very important here. Holistic but not necessarily exhaustive. So holistic means you're hitting all the points. And we're going to be doing that the next four weeks in the God/Man/Jesus response idea of the gospel.</p><p>And there are some students who came back, and they were asking, hey, in every time we're preaching the gospel, do we need to get to all four? And honestly, the answer is no to that. But you need to be driving to do that. And at any point, if they just cut the conversation, it's OK.</p><p>You can't do anything to keep them going. But if you can, your holistic approach is the goal. Now, you're going to come across people who are more interested. Then you start exhausting it a little bit. You start going deeper into each point. But our goal is holistic. So letter A here, "Therefore, we cannot push one recorded message or focus on just the love of God." I know this can be a temptation.</p><p>There's a sermon that really spoke to you at a certain point in your life. And so you have a recording of it. And you say, just listen to this. That's actually really good to do. But that is not the end goal. That's not going to quite do it. You also can't ask the question, what's the minimum that I have to share?</p><p>What are the basic elements that are the bare minimum of what will save you? An unbeliever is required to believe all that is God's truth. Thus, your goal is to present a holistic, biblical worldview of salvation. Again, we're going to hit this over and over again in the next few lectures.</p><p>And the message is not the same as your testimony. This means that your personal journey to faith is not the same as the message itself. You can definitely share the gospel in your testimony. But if you're sitting there just talking about your own walk, that's not it. I felt just like you.</p><p>I was right where you were. This will help you maybe become a vehicle into the gospel. But don't let that become the thing that's supposed to change this person. God's method. God-centered ED involves the local church as not only integral, but primary. It's not only integral, but primary. And here's the error.</p><p>Pragmatics has been a major confusion and error in the methodology of modern evangelism. In an effort to make the church more successful, like being relevant, effective, winsome, or appealing, church leaders have adopted philosophies and methodologies that compromise the message of salvation by compromising the mode. So the church is primary in this.</p><p>And then number two, God-centered ED involves the lifestyle witness of each member of the church. Involves the lifestyle witness of each member of the church. And this chart that you see below here is basically a lot of different instances where evangelism is happening. You see Paul evangelizing in circumstance.</p><p>He's in jail, and he's just evangelizing in that circumstance, even in a difficult circumstance. You see them going house to house many times. You see them preaching open air. You'll see many conversations happening. So evangelism is a lifestyle. And so this one right here-- kind of getting tired of talking.</p><p>Isn't it cool? OK, can you read this for us, the next paragraph? Evangelism is a deeply linked to life and relationships. Whether in the synagogue, or the marketplace, or the home, the gospel is communicated through life studies. Evangelism is linked to life and the events of life. Within a program, it is a practice.</p><p>You don't see it in the Bible. People don't get time to go evangelize. Whenever there is an unbeliever, they share the gospel. So you understand that a little bit? There was a very reason with college ministry, I was very hesitant to set a weekly evangelism time. But we are evangelizing and things like that.</p><p>It's because that idea of setting the time to evangelize is not what evangelism is. Through the church, you can do that. And that's what we're doing in March. It's great that we can all go do that together. But if that's like, see, I am evangelizing, you would be incorrect in that.</p><p>Because evangelism is more natural than anything else. In your relationship-- that's why in this chart, like this Paul's in jail, he's just evangelizing. And then he's going house to house, intentionally evangelizing. And he goes out open air preaching. And then in conversation, he's evangelizing. That is, again, remember going back, this is the mission of our life.</p><p>So the church, to grow the church in a holy huddle is not the mission of our church or even our lives. We're being equipped. Even that's what it says in Ephesians 4. It says that these people were developed and brought up and chosen by God and given these gifts to equip the saints to do the work of ministry.</p><p>The work of ministry isn't just like relegated to like, oh, what I do is clean up ministry or parking ministry. What we're doing as a church is we're trying to comprehensively do church together, that our church would, yes, be building each other up. You see it in our four visions.</p><p>But ultimately, that we're going out and preaching the gospel. That is actually our ultimate mission and goal. And so if your mission statement is kind of going along with all of our mission statement, really, this is so challenging. This is so, so challenging. You look at your life and say, but has that been my goal?</p><p>Has that been my mission? And then the second danger is to then jump into, I have to go evangelize. But that's important on this lecture. You can't go from, but have I been doing that? To, I have to go do that. It has to be, but has my passion been for God's glory?</p><p>Has my heart been a love and obedience to Christ? We have to fill that in so that the I have to go evangelize becomes real. And hopefully, when we go out to-- after we do this and you guys are evangelizing, that motivation is corrected. OK. We are almost there.</p><p>Our confidence, God's sovereignty. Oh, I love this part, that we go out in so much confidence. Sometimes, even now, I just don't like talking to people very much. And so when I'm out there, the adrenaline rush is very real. Every time I go, I hate this. I hate this.</p><p>Every time. Every time. But I drown it out. And I feel, actually-- and it's not like one of those fake things where you're like, like you're not afraid. It's not one of those things. It's like you drown it out by remembering our confidence is truly in God's sovereignty. And this will, time and time again, rescue your sinful, fleshly heart.</p><p>Time and time again. And so you need to come back to this over and over again. We must be careful to distinguish the results from the efforts. The results from the efforts. Let's see. Andrew, can you read for us that quote? Yeah. "The results of preaching depend not on the wishes and intentions of men, but on the will of God Almighty.</p><p>Consideration does not mean that we should be indifferent as to whether we see fruit from our witness to Christ or not. We are not to define evangelism in terms of achieved results." Oh, so good, right? So good. It's not-- who cares about what you see? Who knows what God is doing in that?</p><p>Ultimately, we want to see it, and that's where discipleship comes up. We're going to go into that in one of your resources. But man, that's why the whole victory dance thing, you know? That idea of at the end, when can you really just celebrate and rejoice? The only thing that you have control of is your preaching.</p><p>Have you been faithful? And has evangelism truly occurred? And then the real celebration will continue as hopefully you see things happening in this person later on. But for us, the idea is that we're not going to try to force fruit. And if we don't see that fruit, then we feel all sad and miserable.</p><p>We're confident every time. Every time we evangelize, we're confident, regardless of what we see, because it's not based on them. OK, the goals of God will-- the goals of God will not be accomplished by the ingenuity, determination, the strength, nor the might of man. It will be accomplished by the grace and power of God.</p><p>Oh, such confidence. You don't matter. You matter a ton, because God tells you to go do it. But you don't matter at the end of it, because God is the one accomplishing by His grace and power. And you leave there, and if you did that, then you've left that moment doing exactly what is needed for God to do some kind of work in their lives.</p><p>Now, they might disobey, and they might resist Him, if they're not truly being called by Him at that point in the moment. But for us, where we kind of leave off, we're saying, we could have temporarily manipulated this person to say something, or to feel something, or even to cry.</p><p>But if the gospel wasn't faithfully preached, I'd say, man, that was not good. But if you did, then it was really good. Therefore, we can trust that God's message and God's methods are fully effective. We can focus on following His plan and ordained agenda. We do the preaching, teaching, proclaiming, witnessing.</p><p>We do that. We do it God-centered, not man-centered. We do it with God's glory in mind, not man's glory in mind. We do it because we love Him and we desire to obey Him. We do all of that, and we can trust that that is fully effective. Don't stray from His plan, unordained agenda.</p><p>Letter B, therefore, we can have hope and persevere. Knowing that the giving of faith and the salvation from His judgment is in God's hands frees us to continue in prayer and obedience to God's call to evangelize. We can hope and persevere because-- I like the word "freeze us." Knowing that all of it now is in God's hands, that you've done your part, and now maybe you need to follow up.</p><p>You've done your part. Now you can pray in freedom. Now, can you pray for God to save their hearts when you gave the wrong gospel message? I don't know how you pray there. You should probably pray in repentance. But if you've faithfully preached God's message and you did it without catering to man, without trembling before man and a fear of man, and you did it because you love God, and you really feel like you did a faithful job of presenting who He is, then you can pray saying, God, use it.</p><p>God, do a work. Whatever seed was planted, God, make it sprout. Don't let the enemy take that away. All that kind of stuff can be there. And then Roman numeral number two, pray relentlessly and rely on the Holy Spirit. Pray relentlessly and rely on the Holy Spirit. Kevin, can you read for us Romans 10.1?</p><p>Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. Thank you. It's the desire and the prayer. Don't gloss over so quickly why both are put there. He could have said, I pray for God to save them. Or he could say, my desire to God is-- or my desire is for them to have salvation.</p><p>But he puts both in. My heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. John 16.8. Who's behind you? Oh, Lissy? Oh, hi. And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment. Yeah. He will do the convicting work. And Colossians 4.3-4.</p><p>Next. Praying at the same time for us as well, that God may open up to us the door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I am also a saint in Christ. All right. So here are a couple of questions for us.</p><p>Do you intercede on behalf of unbelievers? The word intercede is not a one-time word. It's a continuation word. Do you intercede on behalf of unbelievers continuously? Do you pray for more opportunities to come your way? That's a big one. Do you pray fervently for that? God, please, today, let it be today, with this co-worker or with this roommate or with this child or whatever, that you would give an opportunity for me.</p><p>When you pray for opportunity, by the way, when it comes, you're all the more ready to jump on it. When you don't, and opportunity comes, you're like, oh, boy. You're like, kind of like, ooh, should I? Should I not? But when you're praying, when it comes, you're like, oh, I prayed for this.</p><p>Let's go. And so it's pretty cool. Do you pray for greater boldness? If you know, if one of the check marks in the beginning was like, nah, I'm shy, I'm timid, well, great. You're self-aware. What do you do with your self-awareness? Do you pray, like, God, make me confident.</p><p>Let me not fear them and things like that. Do you actually pray for that? Do you pray for conviction of sin? These are great things to pray about. Letter B, God ordains the end and ordains the means. He ordains how they will be saved. So rely upon his work.</p><p>And that brings us to the end of the motivation for evangelism. Are there any questions? OK, so to review, our mission is God's purpose. Our passion is God's glory. Our heart is love and obedience. Our evangelism is God-centered. Our confidence is God's sovereignty. So take time to meditate on that a little bit.</p><p>And again, remember, apply to see, like, where am I? Like, am I evaluating where I am and how I've been thinking and how I've been evangelizing? Or have I just been praying a lot for someone to be saved and I've been doing nothing about it? We do that a lot.</p><p>We pray like-- like, every prayer is a prayer. I feel like we're praying for unbelievers, which we ought to be. And we pray for unbelievers. My question is, like, yeah, but since we prayed, did anything happen? You know, did I go and-- did that prayer produce something in me?</p><p>And did that prayer produce more prayer? And, you know, and so let's try to get our mission kind of straight here together, you know, that we are so consumed by it. And a lot of times, we will hear sermons, and we're like, man, I got to stop wasting time.</p><p>Like, the sermon application is, I have to stop watching so much Netflix. Or, you know, I have to, like, stop vegging so much when I get home from work and just I'm on Instagram. You know, like, those are such weak convictions. You know, the strong convictions actually hit both the positive and negative, like the put off, put on principles, right?</p><p>That if it's just to not be lazy, like, come on, you know? It's just to not waste my time? Oh, that's like, we got to do more than that. Like, our motivation needs to be like, we are so captivated by who God is, and it's not even just the hatred of sin, but it's this whole world view that we have of this ticking time that we have in this world, right?</p><p>And we're so consumed with Him, and we come home like, can you waste time? It's different than just like, you know, I'm going to watch a show or a movie. This is very different than just wasting time, right? We know we can go watch a movie, but can you really waste time when you have this mission in life, you have this goal in life?</p><p>So we get so captivated on what we're not supposed to do, but I think what we ought to do should be many times feeding into that, you know? So I did hear that in the past where a bunch of people who committed adultery, they were interviewed, and these psychologists came by and were asking them all these questions, and very interesting.</p><p>The final conclusion was that adulterers, where it happens, where adultery occurs isn't when they fall in love with someone else or attraction to someone else. It's when they fall out of love with their wife. So it's this idea of like-- and this was just like a secular study, but I'm like, there's some truth in this, where when your love for the Lord is so great, like what you see in Philippians 3, 7, 3, 11, actually happens.</p><p>It's not you're staring at these things, and you're trying to convince yourself of the rubbish of these things. But when you're captivated by something so much greater and more beautiful and of more value and worth, that it happens. The rubbish happens. And so evangelism is-- that's why the motivation is the most important thing.</p><p>You could be here saying, train me for evangelism, and you can go out with the wrong motivation, and it did nothing. So homework-wise, these are two very short readings. So if you want to know-- you can go and look at it yourself, but this will probably take you a few minutes to go through this.</p><p>Is this in the packet? It's in the packet. It's in the resources section of your packet. Yes. So if you look at your homework paper, or the-- is it the table of contents? The table of contents shows you homework 1, homework 1, homework 2, homework 2, things like that.</p><p>So homework 1 is after lecture 1. Homework 2 is after lecture 2. And then you're going to be reading Islam and Roman Catholicism. And try to kind of play with the material a little bit, because later on, I'm going to be kind of printing out things, and we're going to be doing the office thing, where you put the thing on your forehead, walk around.</p><p>You're going to be play-acting like a Muslim or Roman Catholic, as well as flipping it around and being the Christian that's evangelizing to the Roman Catholic. So do your best, and then don't need to do that. You don't need to do that, and you're good. Well, let me pray for us.</p><p>Oh, yes. The quiz, is it just going to come from the lectures, or the-- Lecture and the homework. The religion and the resources, or just, is it lectures and the homework? You know, I won't put the religions in there. Oh, OK. Yeah. And the memory verses, can you go over the purpose of memorizing those verses again?</p><p>Sure. So there are four lectures. The next four is going to be on God, man, Jesus, us, or response. And each of those four points of the gospel, we're going to be having memory verses that go along with it. And it's supposed to help you to remember when you're preaching the gospel, when you're evangelizing to people, that you have these memory verses that are going to be there to give you the authority of God's word behind you, so that you're not just relying on your own words.</p><p>But also to remember, this is indeed scripture and biblical. So-- This is for homework two, three, and five. But there's evangelism outreach on March 7th. Is that EV? Is that what EV is referring to? OK. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm talking about the outreach. The outreach. Are you talking about the calendar?</p><p>Yeah. Oh, OK, OK. Because at the end of Romans number five, it's just CU and EV. Oh, I didn't edit that. That was for my college students. Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. OK. If you guys find those mistakes, if you're like one of those ones that you get really annoyed by it, can you actually-- can you message me?</p><p>Can you message me and say, like, oh, on this page of-- and it will be helpful to not distract future classes. So OK. Well, let's pray. God, thank you so much for this group. And I pray that we would take time to let these truths go deep into our hearts and challenge ourselves to ask, how have we been evangelizing?</p><p>What have our lives been about? God, even as we look forward to evangelizing in March, God, is our desire just to scratch a guilty conscience? Or Father, is it because we truly do have a love and obedience before you? God, do we truly care about your glory? And Father, that we would take time to take stock of our lives, to look deep, and see if we believe what we're saying.</p><p>And so Lord, help us not to be people who desire just to be trained or discipled in certain ways. But God, it is truly because of the shepherd we love and follow. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
