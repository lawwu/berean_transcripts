Welcome to Bering Community Church. Let me get to a few announcements before we get started. Before we do anything, I was asked, again, to make a little push for the families with seats in this service. We're actually running out of space in our cry room and different spaces.</p><p>And so we've noticed that there's been a shift from the first service to the third service. And so if you are able, especially if you have children who are in the Seeds Department, if you are able to go to the third service, because we're running out of space for the second service.</p><p>Okay, so we have plenty of space if we spread out. But if we all come to one service, it's going to become an issue. So if some of you who are kind of like able to go to the third service, we ask that you go. And there's a Seeds Ministry that's happening there as well.</p><p>So if you're able to do that, if you can make an effort to do that, that would be appreciated. FAM 245, if you're a part of the Young Couples Ministry, married three years or less, there is a bowling gathering fellowship happening this, not this Saturday, but on September 21st at 10 a.m.</p><p>at Irvine Lanes. So please sign up for that if you're planning to go. Next round of membership class is happening starting on September 29th, 9.30 a.m. at the Youth Chapel. So during this service at 9.30, there's an eight-week course that takes place at the Youth Chapel across the courtyard.</p><p>And again, it's an eight-week course. It'll last about an hour and a half each session. And we go over the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and what our church, and how our church practices our ministry philosophy. And so this is a required class to become a member of the church.</p><p>So if you're planning to become a member, the next session is starting in September 29th at 9.30. So there will be a sign-up. I'm not sure if there's one outside in the quad, but you can go online or go to our church app, and there'll be sign-ups there. And lastly, if you're part of the Jubilee Ministry, if you're 50 and over, there is a Jubilee Saturday morning prayer breakfast fellowship that's happening on September 12th.</p><p>So it's a little bit away, but I want to give you a heads-up on that Saturday at 8.30 at the cafe area. So if you're 50 and over, there will be breakfast, and the cost of it is going to be $10. So we'll be meeting there on October 12th at 8.30.</p><p>So please sign up for that online or if there's a table outside. I'm not sure if there is a table, but please sign up for that. Okay, I think that's it for this morning. Let me pray for our offering, and then again, if you brought physical offering, there is a box in the back that you can drop it off on the way out.</p><p>All right, let's pray. Gracious Father, we thank you so much for your grace. We thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to worship and honor you. We ask, Lord God, that you would bless this time that our mind, our heart, our focus, our will, may all be surrendered to yours.</p><p>We pray, Father God, that you would help us to recalibrate our thoughts, our lives, that we may be able to give you worship that is genuinely in spirit and in truth. I pray that you would bless this offering. It may be given with joy and thanksgiving. It may be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. In closing, I forgot to mention, my niece Ellie will be baptized this morning, so after the worship time, she'll come up and give her testimony and then be baptized, okay? Let us all rise, and before we continue, we could spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us.</p></div></body></html>
