href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=467s">00:07:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like yesterday, Elder James came and gave a canon of scripture seminar for our college

in the words of scripture, we see-- like the epistles, for example, the different personalities coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=481s">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's funny to me when I read Paul versus when I read something from John.</span></div><div class="c"><span

have, as we talk about authority of scripture and handling objections, that being the primary thing, really feel the confidence of knowing why we believe this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=524s">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe once we get it uploaded, I'll send that link to everybody.</span></div><div

the way, I was watching this big heavyweight boxing match the other day, and they're boxing, and you realize all the training that they do isn't to go out into the ring and to think, oh, a punch is coming at me, I need to dodge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=778s">00:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The training is there so that when

constantly, like every moment, this thing is still coursing through you that I'm on a mission here, and that mission isn't for me to assuage some kind of Christian guilt or to go out into, in the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=803s">00:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And constantly, this is your anchoring thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=805s">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our passion, obviously God's glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

obedience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=816s">00:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those come concurrent to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=818s">00:13:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And our evangelism is God-centered, remember, not man-centered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=822s">00:13:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope you were able to look through that list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=824s">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And our confidence, then, at the end, after all of that, our great confidence is that God is sovereign over all things, and that we are called, then, to be faithful in preaching God's message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=834s">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's when we kind of went into, last week, on God being the center point of everything, that God is creator, God is holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=843s">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is so much more we should have gone into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=846s">00:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We could have had like five lessons just on the holiness of God, and it would have been very, very, I would say even necessary for us to insert into evangelism training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=856s">00:14:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So necessary, because we can't just be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, God is holy, but we need to really believe that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=863s">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That this can't be something you're told to do, but it needs to be something that is yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=870s">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's difference between something being truthful and something being your truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=875s">00:14:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can nod and say, like, God is holy, God is creator, but when it's your truth, you're wired that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=881s">00:14:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're going out, you don't find yourself, without realizing it, really swayed by a man-centered worldview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=890s">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't even realize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=893s">00:14:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it does come down to your own personal walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=895s">00:14:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this stuff is very important to your view of God before we go out and preach it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=904s">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go ahead and, in the introduction, this is just a short little exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=910s">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to give you about a

anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=914s">00:15:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=915s">00:15:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How does the modern, normal, quasi-agnostic, post-Christian American view himself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=920s">00:15:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no right answer to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=921s">00:15:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how does the modern, down-the-street American Catholic view himself?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=931s">00:15:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can just say, kind of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=955s">00:15:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, if you haven't, move on to the next one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=964s">00:16:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The American Catholic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=975s">00:16:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you finish up here, the reason for this exercise is because this is very important for you to do as you evangelize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=994s">00:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't be coming with just totally in your worldview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1001s">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">even though we're trying to bring them into a biblical worldview,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1004s">00:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to walk to where they're at and draw them in is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1008s">00:16:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're there and you treat every person as unbeliever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1014s">00:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's an unbeliever in front of me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1016s">00:16:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">while that's spiritually true, they're wired very differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1019s">00:16:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so even on Mars Hill, when you see what the Apostle Paul does with a very Greek-centered society,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1026s">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he goes and

some person, as we go evangelize in a couple weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/394267959#t=1035s">00:17:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that this
