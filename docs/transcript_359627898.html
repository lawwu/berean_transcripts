Why don't we go ahead and pray and then we'll jump into the seminar today. Father, we thank you for just the opportunity to talk about some practical things that parents deal with, that we deal with for God's sake in this world. Lord, as we've been encouraged by anchoring to Christ, I pray Lord God that you continue to motivate us to look at things Lord God would spiritualize, that you give us much wisdom as we try to raise our kids in awareness, but most importantly Lord God that we pray that we can have just the opportunity to share the gospel with them that they can come to know you from an early age. So with all the challenges that we face in this world I pray that we glean some wisdom from today's seminar and may you use it for your glory as in all things that we do. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Come on in, come on in. This is the only way in. Yeah. Alright, so the genesis of how this class kind of happened, you might be thinking like how did this come out of a seminar for anchoring to Christ? So there were some moms in our Sprouts ministry that wanted some kind of information on how to make the internet usage for their kids safer. So that was the genesis, that was talked about months ago and then the opportunity came where a seminar topic was discussed, hey maybe Elder Joe can talk about cyber security. Now you might wonder like Elder Joseph Jett, how's that have anything to do with cyber? So if you don't know, this is my background. I'm a detective with the Oregon Police Department. Another title is a forensic examiner. I basically, I'm on a FBI cyber crime task force for the last five years. So this is what I do daily. This is my day job. Maybe not specifically dealing with some of this, but for the most part, everything technology related to computers, internet, that's what I do. This is an interesting quote, technology is only technology to those who were born before. So case in point, maybe some of you guys are old enough to understand this video. Okay, so go ahead and lift up the box. You have four minutes to dial that phone number. Wait, that phone. Kyle, you go. I'll be running that later. It's all up in here. I'm sorry. We are arresting you.    So this goes on for four minutes. If you look confused, you have to lift the phone if you're too young to understand. I'm not going to call you out. I can see it in your face. All right. So the agenda. So how does this relate to Christianity? Some current trends, some risks of devices and social media, and then what to do with those things. So the Christian perspective. So being naive is not your calling as a believer. We're not expected to just let the world kind of dictate how we process the Internet and cybersecurity. So Matthew 10, 16, 17 says, "I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as devils. Be on your guard and you'll be handed over to local councils and be flogged and sent to the guards." So obviously not directly related to cybersecurity for the disciples back then, but this is the principle that the world is after us. We're its enemy. So know your enemy. Ephesians 2.2, we did that this morning. "In the way you used to live, when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work and those who are disobedient, remember, we have an enemy." Spiritual insight and where we're taught connects us to evaluating physical world applications. So when we think of how we function in the world, we've got to think with a biblical worldview. So how does a biblical worldview dictate how we respond and how we protect and how we use the Internet? So why do we need to talk about cybersecurity? You guys, who doesn't watch the news? So everyone recently, the Capital One, the hack, I think it was a billion or 200 million accounts were exposed. So we're more connected every day. This is just an example of just what's going on, not even in the Christian world, everybody. People are getting hacked. Attacks are increasing. So this is a good example of just the background of what the Internet is. Anyone know what the dark web is? You've heard of it, right? So anyone know what the deep web is? Have you heard that term? So just a quick explanation. Surface web, like the example says, is an iceberg, the tip of the iceberg. Google, what you can see on regular websites. Deep web is kind of like everything you log into, your Gmail account, everything with a password and user, a username and password. And then if you've watched the news, you know about the dark web. That's where bad stuff happens. Illegal stuff, drug trafficking, all the bad stuff we don't even talk about. So a lot of money is being lost. If you think about how much drugs are being purchased on the Internet through the dark web, the scale is pretty big. And me and law enforcement, we're way behind the curve for that. And then obviously, they'll sell your information on the dark web. These are the keys to the kingdom. This is your identity. Name, social security, date of birth. That's the three keys. If I have that, I can open lines of credit in your name. That's basically the gateway to your identity. So obviously, this is something that's very prevalent in the news. And who's ever had their credit card compromised? Yeah? Pretty much everyone. So when we talk about phishing, so obviously, this is a church retreat. But you guys work in the workforce. How many of you guys from your companies know about phishing? So don't click on attachments. Beware of different kind of e-mails. So the difficult part is if you see this on a link, what do you notice? That's a Google sign-in. So you're just doing your thing. Oh, Google wants me to sign in. You sign in with your username and password. Basically, they've got your information. So all of these websites are legitimate, but they can be illegitimized easily. Social engineering. So this is something that a warning you might get when someone's accessing your passcode. If you follow our Facebook page, this is an e-mail from Jason Choi. Google is trying its best to try to figure out, okay, this might be a phishing scam. But you have to understand, any kind of link, there's a possibility it's going to take you, and there's multiple different problems with that. It can take you to a legitimate website. It can be the new one I just heard. American Airlines sends you an e-mail saying, "Oh, can you confirm this travel ticket you have?" "Oh, can I purchase a ticket?" It goes to the American Airlines website, log in, and then put in your information. There you go, compromised. So this stuff is very prevalent. So these are some broad topics. So the challenge with what I had to kind of whittle down what to talk about. But obviously, we can talk. There's a lot of time after this if you want to ask questions. Ransomware is a big one. Who doesn't know what ransomware is? Okay, ransomware is basically you click on a link, and it encrypts all your drives. So it's basically--they want ransom because you don't get your data. All your pictures, they've encrypted it, and they have the key. They won't give you the key unless you pay them. So all your family photos--this is more on the commercial side in businesses. All this critical data gets encrypted for functioning of business, and they can't function. So a lot of businesses will wind up paying thousands of dollars for that key. That's ransomware. Spear phishing is basically the idea of sending the CEO of a company or an employee an email, hoping that person puts on an email. Doxing is the idea of basically politicians right now, they basically get doxed, meaning hackers will go in and release all of their personal information on the Internet, where they live, who their family members are, and all that. So there's a bunch of these things. Probably some of you got robocalls. It's huge right now. There are too many, yes. Identity theft, and then obviously your data is already out there. If you're a part of the Equifax, that's a billion. So all of these things are out there in the open. So who's the target? So when you think about cyber threats, these are typically--you have the activism, that's basically activists who are hackers. The criminal, the insider attacking inside. What was I going to say? Oh, that's the secret, like spy stuff, terrorism, and then nation states. So these are the threats. For us normal people who are living day to day, we don't get most of this. It might just probably be the crime, the guy who's hoping to send you an email and you click on it. So why is cyber security so hard? The user is going to want to click on that video. They want to see that instant thing. So that's the challenge. We are inquisitive in nature of how we do things. So we won't press, "Oh, what's this big--it has a little Play logo. I want to see that." And you'll press it. That's the problem. That's the challenge. So how do you-- First step, I live in a world of cynicism and skepticism because people lie to me when I work. So whenever you deal with any kind of what we call PII, you have to be skeptical. People who answer the robo calls and say, "Hey, you need to send money," or the IRS is going to come after you. "Okay, how do I send money?" "Go to 7-Eleven, go buy some gift cards, and scratch it off and tell me over the phone." Does that sound ridiculous to you? Maybe. Hopefully you haven't done it, but people fall for it daily. They go to 7-Eleven on the phone. Like, "Oh, what?" They're talking to the--to basically the criminal, saying, "Which one should I buy?" And they're taking it from the 7-Eleven or Target or wherever. So this is real-life stuff. Typically, people who fall for that really don't know anything about technology. Senior citizen communities typically do. So that same password--who uses the same password? I do. I do. I do, too. Just be honest. Okay, so laziness is your problem. Right? Yeah, it is. It is. Thank you for that. So basically, one of those passwords is probably floating out there. So part of my job right now is to hack into computers of criminals, right? And hopefully their passwords are floating around. So right now, I have a--I'm actually working on one right now that's--we're trying to get 900 billion passwords right now. So it takes--900 billion, it'll take 15 days to try 900 billion. So these passwords are floating out there. So how do you deal with that? You know what a password manager is? Anyone? Last pass, one shot? Basically, it's a program that you--basically, it's a vault, right? All you need is one master password that is too strong, and then it builds passwords for you, like long 15-character ones with uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and whatnot. So it's cheap. Some of them are free. But these are good for just your security overall. If you use the same password for all your banging, then that gets compromised, and the likeliness of it might be higher for you because it's compromising your--in your bangs and whatnot. Two-factor authentication. Anyone have this? So this is--this is probably even more secure than hard passwords, right? When you log into Google, you get a text message, like, "Hey, what--I think Chase does it right now," if you have that on, right? So that--basically, you need a password, and you need a physical device. So authentication is the problem in cybersecurity. So they want to be able to authenticate that way. And then Internet of Things. So let me tell you what Internet of Things is. Basically, everything that's not a computer or your phone or a tablet, basically your washing machine, your refrigerator, your IP cameras, your thermostats, all of those devices are called Internet of Things. So this is the next generation of what's going to get hacked. So because the security is not tight on this stuff. Because there hasn't been a--like, you've heard of those baby monitors getting hacked, right? And the male's voice starts speaking into this--like, if you watch the news, don't watch the news. But they can hack those things, so be careful with those. And put strong passwords on it if you can. Internet devices, obviously. These are the things we typically think of when we're talking about Internet devices. So, the crucial question, when is the right time for a phone for your kids? Never.  What age did you give a mobile device, for those of you who have given, and why? What justified the giving of that device? Probably location and connection, right? Like, back in the day, there was no phones. Our parents had to just, like, go out and play for the best, right? Nowadays, it's like, you've got to have your phone on you. And where are they, right? Check in now. Like, where are you, right? So, those are the things, the challenges that we have. Why? Because our world's different. It's--are there more predators out there? Some would argue, yeah. But those are the worst-case scenarios, right? So, these--and there's hundreds more. You've got to think of social media like a public restroom. You don't just, you know, you don't put out information that's private in a public restroom, okay? So, this is a video. So, it's a viewer discretionary device. There's, like, people reacting to this, so I've got to kind of qualify it. They do bleep it out, but, you know, we're at a church retreat, so there's nothing, like, too hard. It's just--it's just-- Hi, I'm Jack Vale, and I want to see how easy it would be to get personal information from complete strangers. And while I'm at it, of course, freak them out a little bit. Keep in mind, when you watch this video, I got all of this information just by searching their personal social media posts. And I got it by searching for the closest Twitter, Instagram, and other social media posts to my current location. Let's go. So, everybody, are you enjoying Jessica? I'm Jack. Hi, nice to meet you. How are you? I'm Ashley. Whenever it comes to me, I know who it is. I know it's weird, but I have to shout it out to see if I'm right, and in that case, I was right, so. What the bleep are you doing? Are you stepping? How you doing? I'm Jack. Did you say that? No, I'm Elena, right? Yeah, I know. I was just going to say happy birthday. Someone in your family is referred to as pop. Is it a dad or a grandpa? You're a god right now. Really? Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you too, because I know you were actually, I should have said it to you because you're 80 before. I know, I'm just like, hey, it's been like seven weeks now or something. But anyway, good to see you. What's with it? Like a little white curly dog. Sort of like a little white dog. Are you a dog? It goes on for a long time. You guys have a lot of, basically, most of you use Instagram, Facebook, log it down to friends only, right? But your kids, when they get older, when they start social media, if you don't talk to them, they might make you public. So social engineering. What is social engineering? Basically, it's basically tricking people into giving your information. These robocalls, that's what social engineering is. They're tricking you to worry about something. Hey, we kidnapped your kid. If you hang up the phone, your kid's dead. Okay, so I can't call my kid, so do I trust this? These are all the toys that they use. Kids use social media, so they post about personal information, vacation. Maybe some of you do that, right? It's okay if they're all your friends, but if it's on public, then what? You escape the location of your backpacker, right? You're giving too much personal information out to the internet. So beware of that when they're using social media. The challenge is, if your kids are more technical than you, raise your hand. Okay. The parents who have older children who are dealing with this, they are more technical than you. So it's challenging. So this is just to scare you. What's up guys, I'm Kofi Preston. How easy is it for a pedophile to pick up an underage child using social media? Well, today we're going to find that out. I made a fake profile on Facebook posing as a 15-year-old boy. With the parents' permission, I friend requested three girls ages 14, 13, and 12 years old. I've been talking to these girls for the last three or four days, and today we're supposed to meet up. What we found in this video is shocking and something everyone should see. Be sure to watch until the end and use what we've learned in this video to better educate your friends and family. I hope you guys enjoy the video.</p></div></body></html>
