you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=172">00:02:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">know, soldiers coming into the United States, is there going to

on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=184">00:03:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in the sky flying, they just landed wherever they were at and then they were stranded for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=188">00:03:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=189">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So all this security checks and stuff that we have to go through now has been implemented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=195">00:03:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=197">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you may remember years ago, we were able to go into Canada and Mexico without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=202">00:03:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a passport, remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=203">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We would just kind of go in with our driver's license, come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=206">00:03:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then after that, they changed the law so that now we have to have a passport because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=209">00:03:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to be a bit more careful with the border

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=217">00:03:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I remember very specifically the mantra of that time is, "We will never forget that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=224">00:03:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we are under attack."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=225">00:03:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the first time, at least in the history of the United States that I remember, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=230">00:03:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, prior to Pearl Harbor, where American land was literally attacked, and we knew that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=237">00:03:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there were terrorists outside of the borders of the United States, but the fact that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=240">00:04:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">were able to come into this country and kill senselessly almost 3,000 people kind of gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=249">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it reality that if these people had their hands in a nuclear bomb, they wouldn't hesitate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=255">00:04:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=257">00:04:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that fear caused everybody in the United States to come together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=263">00:04:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember very specifically that Republicans and Democrats, at least from what I remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=269">00:04:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they've never really got along, you know, but nothing like it is today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=273">00:04:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But even back then, they were constantly bickering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=276">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember very specifically in Capitol Hill, they stood arm to arm saying that, "We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=282">00:04:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">at war with these terrorists and that you've attacked us, so now we're going to war."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=287">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what started all this war in Afghanistan and then into Iraq and war against terrorism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=293">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, I remember the very specific mantra, "We will never forget."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=298">00:04:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most of us will agree that we have forgotten, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=303">00:05:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=305">00:05:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every year when there's a commemoration, obviously it was the 20th year, so it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=309">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger than the previous years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=313">00:05:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason why I say all of this is because that particular event caused people who went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=318">00:05:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">through that and saw that, caused us to see the world differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=323">00:05:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That this wasn't the same United States that prior to 9/11, you know, how we felt before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=328">00:05:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and how we felt afterwards caused us to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=332">00:05:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't because evil was created by 9/11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=336">00:05:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It just kind of reminded us there are people who are willing to do that if you give them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=340">00:05:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">an opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=341">00:05:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to be constantly vigilant and be ready.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=345">00:05:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I say all of this because the Bible tells us that not just there's a physical war going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=350">00:05:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on, he says we have an enemy who's the devil, who's like a roaring lion seeking someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=356">00:05:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to devour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=357">00:05:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And Paul says in Galatians or Ephesians that we are in this spiritual battle constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=364">00:06:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603496181&t=365">00:06:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the moment that we forget that and we relax, that's when we are the most vulnerable.</span></div><div
