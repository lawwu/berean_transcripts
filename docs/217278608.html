verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=116s">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">9 through 20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

being called and revealing his glory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=145s">00:02:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and his vision to him so that

wasn't simply to say here's the gospel information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=190s">00:03:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I have for you and it is no different for us that our calling in life isn't to regurgitate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=197s">00:03:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">information that we know about Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=199s">00:03:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It is very ineffective so if you've ever tried to share the gospel with somebody here's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=205s">00:03:25.080</a></span> |

href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=211s">00:03:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The gospel was never meant to be transferred from fact to fact, from person to person that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=217s">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">way, from in a classroom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=219s">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It was always meant to be as a form of testimony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=233s">00:03:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He is about to give this revelation to the church and obviously to all of us but in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=237s">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that he prepares him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=239s">00:03:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He does that, we see that in the book of Isaiah chapter 6,

much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=292s">00:04:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">time in the church of Ephesus, most likely he spent a lot of time with these other churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/217278608#t=296s">00:04:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">too.</span></div><div
