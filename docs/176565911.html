href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=113s">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright okay, if you guys can take a look, Isaiah 60, 1 through 9.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=123s">00:02:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, a continuation of Isaiah 60, describes what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=130s">00:02:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first chapter that we're looking at, chapter 61 through 9, it begins by saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=135s">00:02:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=139s">00:02:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically it's obviously a promise of rescue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=142s">00:02:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the previous chapter, it talked about the darkness that Israel was in, and so chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=147s">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">60 begins by promise of the Redeemer coming and rescuing them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=156s">00:02:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I want to note in this passage is where he says that as a result of His glory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=162s">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">coming and being restored back into Israel, that all the nations are going to come to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=168s">00:02:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">them because they're going to see the glory of God resting upon them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=177s">00:02:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I mean, this is a lesson that we are taught over and over again, and for whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=183s">00:03:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason, we have a tendency to kind of sidetrack, but again, in a nation of Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=188s">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they try so hard by their own effort to be a great nation, by allying themselves with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=193s">00:03:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">certain other groups, or trying to be victorious militarily, and none of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=199s">00:03:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The more they struggled with their own might, they struggled, and they would actually bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=204s">00:03:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">upon them judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=207s">00:03:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end times, the Lord says that when He comes, when He reveals His glory, and His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=211s">00:03:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">glory is upon the nation of Israel, what immediately happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=217s">00:03:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They begin to shine, and then all the nations begin to come to them because they see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=221s">00:03:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">glory of God resting upon them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=224s">00:03:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the end, it's related to the questions that we've been talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=229s">00:03:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The primary way that God glorifies Himself and does evangelism is when the glory of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=236s">00:03:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is evident in the church, in His people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=242s">00:04:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It never works when we say, "Listen to what I say, but don't look at what I do."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=248s">00:04:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It never works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=249s">00:04:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He's like, "Oh, it's the gospel, it's the same truth, who it comes from."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=253s">00:04:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the attraction that they have toward God is going to come through the attraction to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=257s">00:04:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=259s">00:04:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the glory of God is evident in the life of the Christian, that's when non-Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=264s">00:04:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are attracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=265s">00:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You try so hard to share the gospel with people, but if they don't see the glory of God upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=270s">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you, then it's going to be futile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=273s">00:04:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's basically what the nation of Israel's history, constantly by their own effort, all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=278s">00:04:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that happened to them was destruction and judgment day came upon them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=282s">00:04:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end, as soon as the glory of God comes and restored unto Israel, everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=286s">00:04:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">else gets restored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=289s">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">City gets restored, wealth gets restored, health gets restored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=294s">00:04:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then even them coming, they become a super nation that what they couldn't do by their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=300s">00:05:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">own might, it just happens when the glory of God comes and rests upon them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=307s">00:05:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this is a constant reminder to us as a church that the most important thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=311s">00:05:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that every Christian, every church needs to do is to abide in Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=317s">00:05:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If we're not abiding in Him, don't worry about, "Are we doing evangelism?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=323s">00:05:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't worry about, "Oh, do I feel connected or do I have enough Christian friends?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=327s">00:05:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't worry about all that stuff, because all of that stuff is superficial if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=330s">00:05:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">first and foremost, if you're not abiding in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=334s">00:05:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, that's individually and as a church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=340s">00:05:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How will they react?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=344s">00:05:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the Lord comes in His full glory, the Gentile nation shall see it and be attracted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=348s">00:05:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span

answer in a little bit, is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=369s">00:06:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the fulfillment of these

when we talk about these prophecies that God makes to Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=394s">00:06:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and to the nations, that there are two views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=399s">00:06:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One view is that the

href="https://www.vimeo.com/176565911#t=421s">00:07:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the book of Revelation chapter 20, starting from verse 3, you'll see the</span></div><div
