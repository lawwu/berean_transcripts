King of all days, oh so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above. Humbly you came to the earth you created, all for love's sake became full. So here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.</p><p>You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me. I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon the cross. So here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God. To worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.</p><p>You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me. You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me. All right, well I want to welcome all of you guys. And if any of you are new visiting us for the first time, I want to extend a warm welcome to you and ask that after the service is done, please visit us at our welcome booth.</p><p>It's just right in the courtyard and you'll see the blue, you know, vested volunteers. We'd love to just meet you, answer any questions you have, so again, please visit by after the service is done. Now, for some important announcements for the things that are coming up, please note that we have all church praise and prayer coming up on Friday.</p><p>It's going to start at 7:30 p.m., but please know that if you want to come a little bit early and fellowship over in the cafe, you can do that. You can even bring your dinner and just fellowship here. But again, it's an important time for us to have extended and quality time praying and worshiping together, so please mark that on your calendar.</p><p>A couple of ministry opportunities here where our FIG, which is our family ministry and our Jubilee ministry, coming together in July through October to have Bereans breaking bread, okay, BBB. This is a time to get together in little pockets of three families to fellowship, to talk and converse with each other.</p><p>Now, for this, you do have to be a member because you're committing to a sequence of meetings here. So please, you know, take a look at that and then sign up to participate. You can go to the app or the website to find out more information. For all the men, we have a seminar, men's ministry seminar coming up on August 16th.</p><p>And that's going to start from 9:00 a.m. This does include teaching, Q&A, and also fellowship lunch. So please, again, mark your calendar and participate, and that's just $10 a person. We will be touching upon the important issue of our Christian character in the workplace. So that's an opportunity for all the guys to get together.</p><p>And then we have family ministry, where we're going to do fellowship at the pool, pool parties. This is set on two separate days, August 16th and also August 23rd, where the families can come together, play in the pool, etc. This is just a fellowship opportunity for you to connect.</p><p>So please make sure to check your calendars and then, you know, sign up for that as well. Okay. Well, at this time, we're going to be going into our time of offering. If you did bring a physical check, there is an offering basket right at the entrance. Otherwise, we can take time to give it digitally.</p><p>Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father, we truly do thank you for your mercies are upon us, for your grace is given to us. God, we are sometimes just, you know, amazed that to undeserving people, you lavished your love. And then what's more, day to day, you lead us and instruct us as our God.</p><p>So for all of that, we praise you and lift you up. During this time, Lord, when we're joined together, we want to exalt you. We want to praise your name. And we pray, God, that as our faith, in faith, we sing to you. And by faith, we hear your word and are challenged.</p><p>That all the things that take place here would be pleasing in your sight. We also pray, God, for the offering. That it would truly be an expression of our gratitude. And Father, we pray that the offering would be used to your glory and for your kingdom. We ask, God, that each week we come in and come out, more and more we would be spurred on towards love, towards faith, towards good deeds.</p><p>God, that everything would be turned to you in thanksgiving and praise. We honor you, God, this time. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Thank you. Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
