I know it's like, I'm asking you to dig into what Apostle Paul is trying to aim at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=312s">00:05:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You look at his statement in verse 2, and he's like, "You know, when you were pagans," and then he described them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=318s">00:05:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So why would he bring that up? What, I guess, a simple, easier question. Oh, go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=323s">00:05:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">[Audience member] If they were led astray by idols, then they were led astray by, essentially, the passions of their own lusts. So what was fueling them was, like, their own idolatry, their own desire for the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=341s">00:05:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's gonna make a distinction between, like, a God-given gift, which fuels them, and the fuel that they would derive or have when they're pursuing their idol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=353s">00:05:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">[Pause]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=358s">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said it in a good way, like, there's two different spirits about doing something. One is you're fueled by your flesh and, like, selfish desires.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=366s">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The other is more godly, and you're fueled by the motivation of, basically, God and His Spirit, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=372s">00:06:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So Apostle Paul is definitely gonna attack that. And throughout the entire book of 1 Corinthians, he's been attacking that, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=381s">00:06:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, you're acting fleshly when you compete with each other. You're acting fleshly when, you know, they were saying, like, "I'm of this leader and that leader," and they're acting fleshly in trying to sue each other and all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=393s">00:06:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then even with spiritual gifts, Apostle Paul is definitely getting at them. It's like, what is fueling your exercise of gifts? Is it your flesh? Is it the Spirit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=406s">00:06:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's definitely there. The other thing I find that is very interesting is in thinking about their pagan life, yeah, they were really swayed by any and everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=419s">00:06:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he says, "You were led astray by mute idols." And some of your translations will say, "Dumb idols," okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=427s">00:07:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he'll say, "However you were led." So you were just really like what the Bible talks about as, you know, that shifting shaft or whatever, all the stuff that just blows in the air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=438s">00:07:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Wherever the wind blows, you just go. So he's sitting here first addressing this issue, and you think about the current circumstance a little bit, and you wonder what was happening in their church related to spiritual gifts that Apostle Paul would now embark on this discourse or embark on this teaching segment of, "Hey, I want you to be aware of what's going on with spiritual gifts," you know, concerning spiritual gifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=467s">00:07:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think there was a lot of that. I think there was a lot of this like fleshly, a lot of this like self-ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=476s">00:07:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They were always trying to—I feel like there were a lot of people who were always trying to use the church experience to elevate themselves, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=485s">00:08:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's another thing I feel like was happening is he emphasized the fact in thinking about their pagan life that just as the idol is mute—literally in the Greek it means it has no voice—like it's dumb, as in there's no direction to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=504s">00:08:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no content to it. There's no reality to it. And you were led astray by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=510s">00:08:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you had no idea where you were going. Put it in another way, to you anything was God, even the mute, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=520s">00:08:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And very often when you have that kind of swaying heart and that kind of swaying mind, you yourself can very well become the most ring kind of idolatry, which is the idolatry of self, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=533s">00:08:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I talk about that is because I think in that day and age, it's helpful to think about the culture and the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=544s">00:09:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there was a culture where, remember, the practice of religion was commonplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/146009593#t=550s">00:09:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The practice of pagan religion was all over. It was just rampant.
