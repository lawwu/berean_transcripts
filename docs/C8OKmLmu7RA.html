about second to third trimester, the percentage is almost nothing, which was really shocking to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4665">01:17:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the doctors and the survey actually says the percentage is almost nothing.</span></div><div

pregnancy where it doesn't actually go to the uterus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4676">01:17:56.000</a></span> | <span

already is going to -- it's not going to be something that will continue in the progress of pregnancy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4686">01:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">even on its own, but it does nevertheless threaten the life of the mother.</span></div><div

wouldn't even be necessarily classified as, oh, we did an elective abortion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4699">01:18:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why I remember I said we have to keep some of these terminologies in line because that's not the way that you would describe that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4705">01:18:25.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4733">01:18:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, so this is an important question about the viability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8OKmLmu7RA&t=4737">01:18:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some people that say viability doesn't start until the baby can survive
