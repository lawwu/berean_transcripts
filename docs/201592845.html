class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=243s">00:04:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It was about a four-month hiatus for various reasons.</span></div><div

to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=256s">00:04:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">weave in together various things, experiences that we went through to just report back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=263s">00:04:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys how our family has been doing overseas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=268s">00:04:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we notice here in verse 24, it says, "And from there he arose and went away to the region</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=272s">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of Tyre and

region, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=280s">00:04:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so primarily Jesus has been doing ministry in Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=284s">00:04:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for him to go out of his way to enter into this Gentile territory is sort of alarming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=290s">00:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for the disciples who are following him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=292s">00:04:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're wondering, "Why are you going to this region, this Gentile region?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=298s">00:04:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says pretty clearly why he goes, if you read the next sentence there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=301s">00:05:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=306s">00:05:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we could observe from this context is that he just simply wants some privacy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=311s">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps some rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=312s">00:05:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you guys have read through the Gospels, you know Jesus is very busy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=317s">00:05:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I taught this book a long time ago here at Berean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=321s">00:05:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you know one of the key nicknames or summary phrases for the Gospel of Mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=326s">00:05:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is the "Go Gospel," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=328s">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, Jesus is going everywhere, doing things, teaching, performing miracles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=335s">00:05:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a good chance that he left Israel for a bit in order to get some rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=341s">00:05:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">However, we

in the next phrase, "Yet he could not be hidden."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/201592845#t=350s">00:05:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now who can be
