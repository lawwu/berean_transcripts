Dear Heavenly Father, we just thank you for bringing us here tonight. We always want to be thankful for the privilege that we have to study your word together. I pray, Lord God, that as we come here tonight, that you allow us to have strength and energy to remember that we are coming to worship a holy God, that we would come here with reverence, remembering who you are and all that you've done for us, and that we would come here with worshipful hearts, God, eager to sing these songs to you and eager to study your word and to just close out 1 Peter. I pray that right now as we just go into a time of singing, that these lyrics and words that we sing to you be an offering that we give to you from our hearts. And would you be pleased, God? We thank you in your name we pray. Amen. Can we all stand for a time of worship?   Here is love, vast as the ocean, loving kindness as a flood. When the prince of life, our ransom, shed for us his precious blood. Who is love will not remember, who can cease to sing his praise. He can never be forgotten throughout heaven's eternal days.  On the mount of crucifixion, fountains open deep and wide. Through the floodgates of God's mercy flowed a vast and gracious tide. Grace and love like mighty rivers poured incessant from above. Heaven's peace and perfect justice kissed a guilty world in love. Who is love will not remember, who can cease to sing his praise. He can never be forgotten throughout heaven's eternal days.   No love is higher. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is deeper. No love is truer. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is like your love, O Lord. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is deeper. No love is truer. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is like your love, O Lord. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is deeper. No love is truer. No love is higher. No love is wider. No love is like your love, O Lord.     When the enemy surrounds and my heart grows faithful within, when the darkness overwhelms and my fears are passing in, I will trust in you, O Lord. In the silence I will wait. I will stand upon your word. You're my solid rock and my salvation, my steadfast hope that won't be shaken. My soul will wait. My soul will wait for you. You're my stronghold and my shield. In the midst of every threat, though the wicked never yield, they will vanish like a breath. As I know the outcome sure, Satan's evil plans will fail. In your power I'm secure. You're my solid rock and my salvation, my steadfast hope that won't be shaken. My soul will wait. My soul will wait for you. You're my comfort when I feel forsaken, my refuge and my sure foundation. My soul will wait. My soul will wait for you. This is love I can't explain. This is mercy unreserved. Through your sacrifice so great, I have beasts as undeserved. For the battle has been won, and I fear no shame or loss. Now the sting of death is gone. You're my solid rock and my salvation, my steadfast hope that won't be shaken. My soul will wait. My soul will wait for you. You're my comfort when I feel forsaken, my refuge and my sure foundation. My soul will wait. My soul will wait for you. Pouring out our hearts before you, we will trust in you. Perfect Savior, strong defender, we will trust in you. Pouring out. Pouring out our hearts before you, we will trust in you. Perfect Savior, strong defender, we will trust in you. May we be seated.  All right. Well, it looks like you guys all have, like, snacks and stuff, as it's our last meeting. We're going to wrap up 1 Peter today. And then we've got--so we've got seven verses out of the last 105. We have the last seven verses left. So let me go ahead and read chapter 5, verses 8 to 14 for all of us. And then we will break up into a time of small group. But before we do that, let me pray for us. Father, it's been five months since we've started just this journey into the first epistle by Peter. And there's a lot that's happened in this world just in the last five months. And I'm sure that there are various changes in our lives as well, some for the better, some for the more painful and worse. But we know that you don't change. We know that you stay the same. You are faithful. You are kind. You are compassionate. You are all-powerful. And you love us. And you love the lost. And so we pray that as we wrap this book up, that you would etch the important truths onto our hearts so that we would know you more and we would be changed. And so this last Bible study for this book, I pray that you would protect it, bless our time, and allow us really to glean much from your word as well as from each other. So we thank you, God, for this time. We pray these things in trusting it in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. So let me read the last seven verses for you. It reads, "Be of sober spirit. Be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him. Affirm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you, and to him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, for so I regard him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. She who is in Babylon chosen together with you sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love, and peace be to you all who are in Christ." So the first two questions you guys are very familiar with. The latter two, after you've done just kind of the verse-by-verse inductive, question number three are what are some of the major themes in 1 Peter that have blessed and challenged you in your pursuit of God? So what are those things now that you've done the 105 verses? And number four, if you've prepared one or you're clever enough to prepare one on the spot, okay, share your one-sentence summary of 1 Peter. And we'll wrap that up like that, and then at 820 we'll do our final wrap-up. Okay? So see you guys at 820. Good night.</p></div></body></html>
