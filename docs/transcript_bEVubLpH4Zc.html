All right. I'm going to get started. If you could join me in prayer, I'm going to ask the Lord to just minister to us in the next, just this part of our Bible study. All right, let's pray together. Lord, we thank you for your word, and we thank you for giving us the freedom and all the tools to die deeply. And in this deep dive, sometimes we end up with a lot more questions than we do answers. And we pray that as you feed us, that more than anything that we would hunger for more. I pray that you would guide our time, that you would help to clarify and illuminate various aspects of this text for our limited understanding, and help us to be led into all truth. And so, Lord, we ask that you would help us to process through this passage and other passages like it, to grow in appreciation of the doctrine of salvation. So, we thank you, Lord, for just our time together, and we entrust this time into your hands. Amen. So, when I first started asking my questions for this passage, I actually had a hard time. Because this seemed like almost a passage that I should be able to just rehearse and recite, like, at length. And when you read it quickly, it's like stuff you've already seen before. But then when you dive deeply, you kind of don't know what to ask. So, I was like, all my questions started sounding like what is justification? What is regeneration? What is renewing? Anyone else have that similar, like, I don't know where to begin, there's so much meat here, right? So, that's normal. I would encourage you guys, as much as you can, do not go into a commentary. Do not use a study Bible, because that's kind of a cheating way, all right? So, for our Titus study, do your best to do all the dirty work, okay? So, what you want to do is, you want to let scripture interpret scripture, so you want to just dive deep, and you want to dig. And after you've done a whole bunch of digging, and then you're kind of still confused, then consult a commentary. But don't start there, all right? So, what you want to do is look at the passage, look at the context, and then look at other related books in the Bible, and then even some, like, Greek word studies if you need to, okay? And so, when I do this, it doesn't look this pretty, because it's just usually just all over the place. But I did this so that you can see how I break it down in my head, okay? And I modified it a little bit from last week. The yellows on the side for this whole section are three imperatives, and one infinitive, basically saying, this is what Paul wants Titus to do, all right? And then, I look at the green, I just put, these are important words that I need to kind of keep my eyes focused on, the buts, and the fors, and the therefores, and things. And the blue in the middle is what we're looking at today, and a lot of this is just literally what we have been saved from, how we have been saved, and what that means. What's our new identity, and what we have been saved for, okay? And then, that highlight in the, like, the light blue, that's the reward, right? That's kind of the product of all of this. And so, that's actually very important, and a lot of fun to just dwell on and think of, okay? And then, I've shared this with you in the past, that this is like the third section of dense theology, okay? So, we had that in chapter one, we have that in chapter two, and now that's our passage today. Every single one of these sections emphasizes, like, an appearance of Christ. So, you guys notice that? You know the word appearing, epiphaneia, that's only used four times in the whole New Testament, but half of those times are in Titus, so that's significant. So, there's an appearing and a manifestation of Christ here in the pink. It emphasizes again and again and again that Jesus and God are our Savior, no other epistle does it like that. Okay, if you guys have poured through the Bible, only in Titus is God and Jesus constantly called our Savior, and there's a reason, because salvation's pretty important, right, to all the good deeds that we're supposed to do, okay? And Jesus being our Savior, that's deliberate, because there's so much application in Titus, right? All of chapter two is just a big application. And if we try to apply them by ourselves, we're gonna be missing the whole point. So, that's why there's so much doctrine in here. And all of this has, like, a future focus. You guys notice? Okay, our identity as heirs and as the bride of Christ. Okay, so John Stott calls chapter three, verses four through seven, like, the fullest statement of salvation in the whole New Testament. So, today, we looked at, like, one of the most, like, rich, dense pictures of our salvation. And so, a few weeks back, if you guys recall, I walked you through this thing called the Ordo Salutis. Okay, the Ordo Salutis does not come out of Titus, and it's actually coming from the whole of Scripture. And Titus doesn't dictate this order, all right? So, I wanna quiz you guys on this. Remember, every Christian reveres Christ Jesus. All saints preach Deo Gloria. All right, so, you guys remember all of these? Go through it in your head. E. Okay, give some people some time, 'cause some people's brains are working slower. It's 8/27, okay? C. Call. R. Regeneration. C. There's a conversion, and what's a J? Justification, all right? Some of you guys, you're like, your brains, you're like, oh, yeah, that's right. A. Adoption. S. Sanctification. P. Perseverance. D is death, and then G is glorification. And election, call, regeneration, conversion, justification. Adoption, sanctification, perseverance, death, and glorification. And this is, some of these are instantaneous and kind of coupled together, but this is how we would say how someone is saved, okay? And just from Titus, we see glimpses of these processes. All three of the little theological passages that we looked at talk about the first five, okay? Not necessarily in order. And then the sanctification and perseverance is all over Titus, where we need to live sensibly, righteously, and devoutly in this present age, and we need to do good deeds and be godly, right? And that's actually next to all of the theological stuff, there's an emphasis on godliness. Do you guys notice this? Here's a bunch of theology, zealous for good deeds, a bunch of theology, like engage and be careful for good deeds. Not sure as if you guys, you pick that up. So there is a connection there, all right? So you can't be theologically literate and just say good deeds aren't important because they're always packed together, all right? And then the death and glorification part, which is the bonus and which is the good stuff, in the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie promised long ages ago, and that's also in each section. So this Ordo Salutis I gave to you a couple weeks back to kind of help you also set up for tonight, okay? But Titus doesn't dictate this. And there are slight variations depending on your theological framework, but this is the one I would subscribe to, and that's just as a review. Now, I'm looking at today's passage I'm not gonna give you any answers or anything that's like mind blowing, but I'm gonna show you what I catch with my eye, all right? So I immediately noticed like, man, the he saved us is the big one. It's the main point. So I just, boop, I pulled it out, okay? That but I wanna keep in mind because my previous identity was described up to verse three. And then if you see this little column, this kind of is all a part of how God saved us. And that's why I just kind of divvied it up this way, all right? Or what aspect of God caused salvation, all right? So verses four through seven, it's one Greek sentence. You guys might have already talked about that. I see seven facets of salvation. Some people say six, some people say eight, but for me it's like seven. And every facet of salvation is initiated and empowered by God alone. All active verbs attributed to God, all passive verbs attributed to man. And if you guys haven't realized this yet, but the Christian faith is the only one where we are saved this way, right? So it seems too good to be true. But in all other religious paradigms, you have to earn your salvation, whatever that means, by your deeds. The Christian faith makes it very simple. You can't, right? It's all, you're a passive person in this, okay? So theological and eschatological, this whole section, it's not chronological. So if you're trying to figure out, oh, where does this fit in the order of saluties? Hey, PPC, you gave us the wrong order. No, no, no, that's not the point of this. This is all, bam, dense theology, all right? And so with chapter two and with the stuff that's gonna come next week and the following week, why we can expect Christians to have a social conscience and to behave responsibly in public life, all right? It is important that you live like a Christian, okay? Not to earn your salvation, but as a response. And that's in the text. Now, verse four, it talks about the kindness of God, our Savior, and his love for mankind. So I look at kindness of God, okay? I look through some word study. I realize this is the word only used by Paul. No one else uses it. And Romans 2:4 immediately comes to my mind, right? Have you not, do you not realize it's the kindness of God that leads you to repentance? Did you guys know that you cannot preach a gospel message without this call to repentance? So modern day, a lot of churches give you a gospel without the importance of repentance. But it's his kindness that leads us to repentance, okay? That causes us to be aware of our sin. So no conversion without repentance. Is that clear? Like, biblically, there is no conversion without a repenting, a turning away from your sin. So the second thing that I see is there's a love for mankind, and this is a little puzzling. The Greek word is philanthropia. Occurs only twice in the New Testament, but only here in reference to God's character, okay? So immediately theological questions come to my mind, okay? Well, predestination comes to my mind. Election comes to my mind. Did God love all mankind, or did he love only his elect? Did he die for all mankind, or did he only die for the elect? Can he send someone to hell still with a heart of love? Because the Bible does say God hates sin, right? But there are cases where, like the rich young ruler, where the man apparently doesn't believe, and he walks away from Jesus, but what does it say, that Jesus loves him, right? So this word is a little bit puzzling for me, because of a theological idea I have in my head called reprobation. And what that is is the sovereign decision of God before creation to pass over some persons in sorrow, deciding not to save them and to punish them for their sins and thereby to manifest as justice. So when you hit a verse like this, there might be like a little theological emotional snag, right, that you're like, I don't quite see how this fits. But when we do inductive study, we put a hedge around like the text. So how we feel and our opinions and our aversion or our attraction to something, it doesn't matter. We're gonna see, okay, if God is God, and he gave us his word, what does he have to say? And certain things are not always easy to grasp or explain. But so this word comes to my mind, okay? So I'm charting through. Verse five is a meaty one. First of all, I notice in the NIV, okay, 'cause I don't just take my Bible and open it to the Greek. That takes too long, okay? And it's been a while since I was in seminary, all right? But I look at the comparisons, I look at NIV, I notice, oh, there's a, he saved us twice. Anybody else pick up on that when they were doing their study? That's weird, okay? Like, why is that the case? So then I actually looked at the Greek. And so I actually have a Bible program called Logos that I use, and it was very expensive, and I use, but a Greek passage like this is available for you on BibleHub.com, it's on the internet, where you can actually, even if you don't know how to read the Greek, you can read the English word, or the English, the equivalent of it. And one thing I notice is that he saved us, where does it come? How many words before the he saved us? 14. So it comes way later in the sentence, all right? So I go, oh, so the emphasis that he wants to make is all of these things that led to our salvation, and with the highlight being that he saved us, and that's why a lot of the translators put it in the beginning, but the NIV decided, oh, we need to remind ourselves of what the point of this whole section is, and so they put the he saved us twice. Another thing I notice in chapter three, verse five, is in a sentence, you usually don't have four nouns, back to back to back to back, do you? Unless there's a comma. But at the end of this, I see four nouns that are all genitive nouns, which means it's like a possessive noun, attributive noun, so I see the washing, regeneration, renewing, and the Holy Spirit are all nouns. Huh, interesting, I haven't consulted a commentary yet, but I'm like, okay, there's something there, and I'm gonna do the work of trying to figure out like what this all means, okay? So four straight genitive nouns, washing, regeneration, renewing, Holy Spirit, and then I'll notice that like righteous deeds has come up again, okay? In chapter two, verse 12, there's a call for us to live righteously, and I've studied enough Bible where if I see Paul using the word righteous, I immediately think Old Testament, because so much of what Paul is saying is you guys are trying to live righteously by the old covenant, by trying to do outward obedience to God's law, but that's not how you're saved, okay? So whenever Paul's talking about righteousness, it points to the fact that man cannot save himself. So I go, okay, I'll take a note of that. But he saved us, the third element, by his own mercy. Have you guys, how many of you guys have ever taken the SATs? How many of you guys took the SATs when there were analogies? It's been a while, I took mine in 1994. So I think I did analogies, but I taught analogies, all right? So the question that I have is like, well, here's the word mercy, and how is it different from grace? So grace kind of does away with the guilt. It's like the sin issue. Mercy is more of a response to affliction. Okay, so I just think that, and I put that down. All right, that's not like some theologically astute, so don't take careful notes, okay? It's like, ooh, grace, guilt, mercy, is like affliction. When someone is merciful, when you play softball and you're down 25 to zero, there's a what rule? Mercy rule, you wanna end the suffering. Okay, so that, oh, okay, according to his own mercy. So I'll take a note of that. And I'll notice that there's a washing of regeneration, which scripture usually says in like being born again, okay? That's John 3 language. And here's another regeneration. So I'll look up maybe a grudem, 'cause grudem, the systematic theology, it has all these definitions. So if I'm not quite sure what regeneration is, I'll look at that. And what it says is it's a secret act of God in which he imparts a new spiritual life, okay? So then I'm left with a question. Is this internal or is this external? Is it two events or one? So I'll note that. And then I go to the next little thing. It's a renewal of the Holy Spirit. Okay, so there's a rebirth involved there. The Holy Spirit, if you look at Galatians 3.14, was a promise of a blessing made to Abraham. Okay, so if you've actually studied through the other epistles and you're like, wait a minute, the promise of the Holy Spirit is like the blessing of Abraham. Okay, there's a connection there. So I'm gonna write that down. And then I get to verse six, it says, okay, the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior. Now at our table, someone asked, is this word poured out very common? Is the word poured out very significant? And if I grew up in a Jewish culture, absolutely. Okay, there are many, many promises of God to his people that in the last days, he will pour out his spirit on all mankind. Okay, and I just put up three there for you. It will come about after this that I will pour out my spirit on all mankind and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, sigh, your old men will dream dreams and your young men will see visions. Ezekiel 39.29, I will not hide my face from them any longer for I will have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel declares the Lord God, Zechariah 12.10. I will pour out on the house of David and on the habitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplication. Now, so the Holy Spirit is also important in here. So I'm gonna start like jotting down, okay, then how does the Holy Spirit, what is his role in my salvation? So then I'll think through, okay, he convicted me of sin and I became a child of God. And then now the result is he's still here. Now I have all that I need for life and godliness. And that's in Ephesians three, second Corinthians three, second Peter one. But I also know that Ephesians one 13 to 14 says, he's a guarantee of my inheritance. So I'm just jotting down notes. Now this isn't like the other Bible studies that I've led. The last 10, I'm giving you other stuff, but this one I'm just going point by point, right? Because in a dense, meaty passage like this, I have to pause a lot. And I don't get any of my questions answered when I'm just going through this, okay? And I get to verse seven, being justified by his grace. First thing I notice in the Greek is it's diakothentes, which is the same root as righteousness. There's a legal declaration. You guys know Romans three 23? For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. For all have sinned, fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace. That's verse 24. So there's a legal term, okay? And I notice in the Greek that it's in the eris, which means it's a completed action. So it's a one-time act. I don't need to be justified again tomorrow. It's done, it's in the past. So if I'm not quite sure what justification means, and then I'll consult my Grudem theology book, and here's a definition. An instantaneous legal act of God in which he thinks of our sins as forgiven and Christ's righteousness as belonging to us and declares us to be righteous in his sight. How cool is that? I've offended holy, holy, holy, holy God. I deserve to be wiped out, obliterated, and experience his full wrath for eternity, but he declares me innocent. Okay, so then I see this word grace, and I have to pause. Okay, I've seen the word grace so much in my life that I'm thinking of just like passing by it, but I'm gonna sit down and just kind of chart through, now how is this significant? It's unmerited favor. Not one single human being can boast that he earned even a fraction of his or her salvation. I was declared innocent, not by anything I did, but because he just chose to respond to my plea of faith, help me, and he deemed me innocent. So there's a lot in here, okay? And there are books upon books and upon books written for every single point, not just if you already knew that. Yeah, so there's no way I'm gonna wrap this up in 25 minutes going through all of this, okay? So all of my homework in these 16 pages was done at home before I consulted a commentary, okay? But I have to teach, so I actually have to consult the commentary. So I'm plowing through all of this, and that takes all of my Monday, my day off. I'm like plowing through all of this, put it together. Wednesday, I'm scrambling until the end to make these slides, but I get to verse seven. So that being justified by his grace, we would be made heirs. And then because I've memorized all of Titus a few months ago, my mind goes back to the similar language. Chapter one, verse two, chapter two, verse 13. There's a similar language. In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago. Verse 13, which we covered two weeks ago, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus. So there's a future focus. Right? And my mind goes to Romans 8, 15 to 17. For you have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by which we cry out, Abba, Father. The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God. And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, so that we may also be glorified with him. So I've just done all this homework from verses four through seven, this one sentence in Greek, trying to chart through all of the significant stuff, and there are pages of it. But I land on this, I would be made an heir part. Okay? And my mind goes to, you know that song? Like, no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has ever conceived the glorious things that he has prepared for us who've believed. Right? So I think of that song, like, how high and how wide, how deep and how, you guys know that song, right? And then I'm like, ah, where was that verse? So I go to Google, I go, no eye has seen, no ear has heard. And then I go, hey, hey, 1 Corinthians 2.9. You should do that, if you're like, oh, this verse sounds like this, use your Google. Okay, we have so many tools. And then I'm reminded of this, right? Things which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and which have not even entered the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love him. Think about this, all right? My eyes have seen some beautiful things in this life. People make visual movies that blow my mind, right? Now we're numb, 'cause we've seen so many of it, right? When "The Matrix" first came out, it's ooh, right? Our friends, we were like, wow, what a cool movie. And I heard "Star Wars" was like that for the previous generation, right? It's like, whoa. But now we're numb, okay? One of my favorite things to do is to go to an aquarium and just sit there and look at the fish. Do you know why? It's like a masterpiece of art under the water. I can't see this from the surface. If I'm driving on the Golden Gate Bridge and I look at the water, it's just brown or blue, depending on the sunlight. But if I go snorkeling or if I go to an aquarium, I'm like, God is so creative. There's fish that are so colorful. There are fish that are so ugly. There are fish that have a little light bulb in the front of it. I'm like, what is that? And I can imagine the wonderful things that God has made on this earth that man has not discovered yet. There are spiders that people are still discovering. And these are all things that people can imagine and conceive of mentally. And for those who are artistic, they can draw it out. Like, lately, my wife and I, not lately, but the other day we watched a documentary on Blackpink. You guys know what Blackpink is? I never knew Blackpink. My wife never knew Blackpink, but we're like, dude, young people today, they all into Blackpink. So there's a Netflix documentary on Blackpink. Let's watch it. So we watched it. But I was like, one of the girls' voices, I don't even remember her name, I was like, she has a nice voice. At my funeral, I would love if she could sing there. Right, I mean, I'm like, wow. What a beautiful sound that she makes. And don't ask me who it is, 'cause I don't even know. But it was like, wow, she has a good voice. But can you imagine, like, when we get to heaven, because we are a child of God, because we are in air, there are things that are unimaginable, unfathomable, not conceivable, that God has prepared to amaze us every day for eternity. Again, and again, and again, where every day we're amazed and gawking and in awe at all the wonderful things that we're seeing, and we have no sin. And when you have no sin, you don't get tired of stuff. One of the greatest strategies of the fall is we get tired of stuff. You go to the Grand Canyon the first time, whoa. You go the second time, you go, wow, ooh, look at them saying wow. The third time, you don't even look at the Grand Canyon, you look at other people's reaction. That's how we are, right? The first time I ate really good food, I was like, wow, it's a party in your mouth. And then you go there again, and again, and again, and again, then it just becomes food. That's sin. But when we are seeing God face to face, sin free, when we're seeing all of his creation, sin free. This is not something that you have even imagined yet, the things that he has prepared for us. And all of this is awaiting for us. Why? Not because we earned it, but because we believed. We committed cosmic treason, as some like to say. But we didn't just get away with it. We got adopted and received all the blessings as someone who's lived in perfect obedience all of his life, all because of Jesus Christ. And because of that, I have a heavenly father, creator of the universe, as my father, who loves me a lot more fiercely than I love my children. There's a lot of work in verses four through seven. But when I got to verse seven in the part of heirs, it hit me. 'Cause I have a very lively imagination. Just thinking, the Bible says I can't imagine what God has prepared, but I'm gonna try to imagine it. Right? Glorious things. And I can start this relationship already. I've already started it. I'm getting to know him. I'm seeing how beautiful he is. I'm seeing how trustworthy he is. And I'm like, why me? I don't worry about everybody else. I'm like, thank God that he didn't just not choose to punish me. He adopted me as his child. Man. I've met a lot of orphans in the world. And when I see Maddie and Karis, a lot of times I'm thinking, they're so fortunate to have Becky as their mom. Me, I don't give myself that much credit. My wife is a very good mom. They are so fortunate. And when they say weird stuff, I actually get pretty upset. So Becky and I are like, we're like, I'm like, hey, you don't say that to your mom. I'm pretty stern about that stuff. They called my egg trash the other day. I was like, your egg tastes like trash. Like that, I was a little offended. But if they said that to Becky's egg, I would get upset. 'Cause I'm like, you don't understand how glorious a thing it is to be a child of her. And I think we live a lot of times learning all this stuff without fully enjoying the benefits of it. Right? So then what's the relationship between our salvation and our good deeds? Churches like Berean, people from outside looking in, every now and then you get that whole, oh, they're legalistic. But you know what legalism is? You're trying to earn your way to salvation by doing good. No, so that's outside looking in. What it is is we are trying to just say thank you by our life. And we're trying to live such a nice, good life so that others will be attracted to this light. We wanna be so different from the world so that when the world is disgusted with themselves, they can see the joy that we have, the love that we have, the compassion that we have, and just kinda wanna come to it. That's why we do good deeds. Not to earn any extra favor from God, but why? To say thank you. As a worship, as living sacrifices, we wanna say thank you. So what's the relationship between all this doctrine that we just breezed through today and our good deeds? And good deeds are all over Titus. 1 16, 2 7, 2 14, 3 1, 3 8, 3 14. It's emphasized again and again in each chapter. So I'm just gonna take you to another Paul's epistle. All right? This is one that you've memorized as a child. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. Not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. Right? You guys know this verse. ♪ Ephesians 2, 8, 9 ♪ Right? You guys know this one. People memorize this and people quote this. It's like, we've been saved by grace. Yes. But you know what verse 10 says? Who knows what verse 10 says? (footsteps) For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for what? Good works, which God prepared when? Way beforehand, so that we will walk in them. So our obedience is our way of saying we love you, we trust you, we want you to get all the glory. Thank you, God, that you took a bunch of mosquitoes and didn't just obliterate us. Didn't just grab all of us and just let us out of hell. But that you took a bunch of us and called us children. What a weird God. It's not amazing grace. It's dumbfounding, silly, absurd grace. How sweet the sound. And that's why we're heirs. So if the study of all of this was a drag, I mean, it wasn't easy. That means you're forgetting, like, you're kinda, it's like you're reading a biography as an outsider looking in. But when you think through, man, this was done to me, that causes you to worship. That causes you to stop complaining. And that starts to work in you to provoke an attitude of just joy and thanksgiving and peace, no matter what the circumstance. Right? 'Cause to die is to what? Christ in me is to live, but to die is? Gang. When we can finally meet and encounter the stuff that we could never have imagined anyway of how good and how beautiful. No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived. Of the glorious thing that the Lord has prepared for those who love him. This passage should really, like, freak you out by how glorious it is. And it's dense. So my encouragement would be just go through it line by line again whenever you have time and just worship through the course of the week at each of these points. Thank you, Lord, for leading me to repentance. It's your kindness. Thank you, Father, for renewing me. And the process of even renewing my mind is the same word, right? Not being conformed to the pattern of this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of my mind. What else of my mind do I need renewed? Lord, I submit. And again, thank you for making me a child. And I'm sorry I call some of the things you give me trash. It should cause us an emotional response because you're reading stuff about your life story and how you went from hell-bound to saint, all because of Christ and his work on the cross. Amen? So you're only gonna have one thing to share with a partner. Describe how you repented in response to the kindness of God, how you came to be justified, and how you've since been living as an adopted heir of God. I could have put this easily as, share your testimony. I didn't wanna do that. 'Cause this one's gonna actually have to cause you to theologically think through your testimony, right? Did you never repent? That's actually a very important question. Have you repented of your depravity? Okay, how did you come to that point of justification? And how have you been living since you've been adopted as an heir of God? Okay, so this is a very packed, weighty question. And however you wanna share it with a partner in your group, by all means do so. All right? Just as a quick reminder, next week, no Bible study. 'Cause I think next week's Thanksgiving week. And then the following week, we're almost done. We have two left, and then we're done with Titus. Okay, Titus 3, 9 to 11, is the following section. It's only three verses. A lot less meaty, okay? So the rest of your time, just do number one, and then you can dismiss in your group.
