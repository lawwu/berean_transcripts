class="t">but I just really felt alone in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1128s">00:18:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess because my reason for going in the first place wasn't really a solid reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1133s">00:18:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never really grew in my faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1136s">00:18:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in ninth grade, after first semester, I just stopped going to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1141s">00:19:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I just considered it like a fad, just like a lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1145s">00:19:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And ever since then, my high school experience was pretty negative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1151s">00:19:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I got into a lot of anxiety issues, depression, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1157s">00:19:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically my life reflected a very sinful life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1160s">00:19:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a lot of sin in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1163s">00:19:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes I did have a little guilt, but most of the time I just didn't really mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1168s">00:19:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1169s">00:19:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this continued on until college when I first came into college thinking party and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1175s">00:19:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all that stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1176s">00:19:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember through that I met a person, and one of the things we actually talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1182s">00:19:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">was Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1184s">00:19:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we both had the same agreement that people were hypocrites in the church because we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1190s">00:19:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them being pretty nice in the church, but when we talk to them outside of it, they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1195s">00:19:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really exhibit a Christian life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1198s">00:19:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're like, "These guys are total hypocrites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1201s">00:20:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're so fake."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1203s">00:20:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then while we're talking about that, I just remembered my cousin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1207s">00:20:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know he goes to church, and I was like, "Hey, he's a good guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1211s">00:20:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he's a really faithful guy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1213s">00:20:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And through that idea, I contacted him, and I started coming out to Berean last fall because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1218s">00:20:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1220s">00:20:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I first came, I realized the first thing was that everyone's super friendly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1225s">00:20:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "This is really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1226s">00:20:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a community that actually talks to you day to day."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1231s">00:20:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they always approached me outside of church like, "Hey, how are you doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1234s">00:20:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to hang out?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1236s">00:20:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that made me feel really welcome when I first came to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1239s">00:20:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel because of that, I continued to come out, not because I loved God, but because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1245s">00:20:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I just felt welcomed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1246s">00:20:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because of that reason, at the end of my first year, I actually just thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1253s">00:20:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about what I was doing with my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1255s">00:20:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wasn't feeling like I was growing as a Christian because I was still pleasuring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1260s">00:21:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">myself in worldly values and just sinning still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1264s">00:21:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wasn't repenting of it either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1266s">00:21:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I decided maybe this is what happened in junior high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1270s">00:21:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a waste of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1271s">00:21:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I stopped coming out during the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1274s">00:21:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But some people contacted me over the summer, including my cousin, just asking how I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1280s">00:21:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1282s">00:21:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I felt really encouraged by that because I just started thinking about all the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1286s">00:21:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I've met at church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1288s">00:21:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone's ... They actually love God, and they have that genuine heart for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1293s">00:21:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I kind of asked myself if they could come to love God, why can't I do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1298s">00:21:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure I just need to push myself more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1300s">00:21:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because of that, after summer ended, I decided to come back, give it a final try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1306s">00:21:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If I don't see any growth in my faith, then I'll just stop coming out again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1311s">00:21:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for a while, I feel I was really pushing myself to just listen and see if I can really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1318s">00:21:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">absorb as much as I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1321s">00:22:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's kind of like a little growth, but I was still not really having that loving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1327s">00:22:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">God, heart for God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1329s">00:22:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And during all this time, I was still anxious and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1333s">00:22:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one day it was really bad where I just came back from school, and I was just in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1339s">00:22:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1340s">00:22:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I just felt super hopeless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1344s">00:22:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember I talked to some of my friends too, just to help me out, because I was going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1348s">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through a lot of issues during that time as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1351s">00:22:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just felt like no one could really help me out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1355s">00:22:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just kind of stuck in an endless cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1358s">00:22:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was like a last resort, just super broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1362s">00:22:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I was really just pleading with God, "Please help me out, because it's really not fun experiencing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1370s">00:22:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of lifestyle."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1373s">00:22:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just really just prayed to God, "If you're real, just please help me out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1378s">00:22:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to feel this way."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1380s">00:23:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And thankfully, God answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1383s">00:23:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't just say, "Here you go, you're healed."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1386s">00:23:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he did was showed me the state of my heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1391s">00:23:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember all these, everything just came into my mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1395s">00:23:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like sin, hatred, evil, all this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1400s">00:23:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember just really feeling just disappointed and disgusted at myself, just for having all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1406s">00:23:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this inside my heart, but not recognizing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1412s">00:23:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember my first just natural reaction to that was to just repent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1418s">00:23:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though I've never really had a genuine

the right thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1426s">00:23:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I started just to really pray to God, just asking for forgiveness, just to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1432s">00:23:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">... Yeah, I was just really apologetic, just not recognizing what was going on inside me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1438s">00:23:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And once I was done with my repentance, I opened my eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1442s">00:24:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember it was a really strange feeling, because during the whole day, I was just ... Not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1447s">00:24:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">even the whole day, but for a while, not really positive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1451s">00:24:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It was kind of just like, it was a real negative

smiling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1458s">00:24:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was kind of crazy, actually.</span></div><div

worked in me that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1475s">00:24:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So from that moment on, immediately I just knelt down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656294#t=1478s">00:24:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Oh my gosh, no, God."</span></div><div
