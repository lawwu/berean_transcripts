Looks like we're all in. Hey, let me take a moment to pray for us, and then we'll go jump into the review.</p><p>All right, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your precious word. We thank you, God, that you grant to us light, you grant to us illumination, and Lord, it's by your spirit, you allow us to feel the conviction, Lord, even if the letter is correcting and rebuking, God, that you grant to us sanctification.</p><p>Lord, ultimately, that you exercise your power to draw us near and closer to the image of Christ. We thank you, Lord, it's in Jesus' name, amen. Okay. So, I love these last lesson of the series. You guys all go all out with your snacks. I hope you guys got a chance to actually talk about the passage on top of your eating.</p><p>Well, let's take a look at the short segment that we have at the very end, and it says, "And those who will walk by this rule, "peace and mercy be upon them, "and upon the Israel of God. "From now on, let no one cause trouble for me, "for I bear on my body the brand marks of Jesus.</p><p>"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, "brethren, amen." When I think about just concluding segments of any letter in the scriptures, it's quite amazing, because in just a cursory reading, it just sounds like your typical, blessed be God, may he bless you, amen, goodbye, right?</p><p>But if you look at every letter, the scriptures are so deep, they summarize all the major concepts into those few words, and it's no different here. When we take a look just at verse 16 and start asking the questions, we know that he's summarizing the fact that the people who are truly blessed, right?</p><p>The people who receive peace and mercy are those who follow this rule, okay? And in a sense, that is the encapsulation of what he's saying, is you guys saw the way of law, you guys saw the way of fleshly righteousness, but I wanted you to see the way of true blessing, which is freedom in the spirit.</p><p>That's essentially the entire letter, just like summarized into one simple sentence. But in a more narrow and specific observation, we wanna ask the question, what rule is he talking about? Okay, what rule is he talking about? Now, I thought the term for rule was quite interesting and worthy of our time, because it's the word canon.</p><p>It is where we get the term, the canon of scripture, so to speak. It means anything that is a straight line used to examine, to measure things up. And so it was used of plumb lines, you hang a weight to make sure that something is straight and true as it's being constructed, or a straight line, like this is the edge, this is the measurement, okay?</p><p>And so when we think about that, it's worthy for us to ask, how would you summarize this idea of the rule that Apostle Paul wants you to live by, okay? Just before this segment, he also summarized what he was saying in a very specific argument. He said, you know what?</p><p>In conclusion, circumcision is nothing. As a matter of fact, uncircumcision or circumcision is nothing, but what? New creation, okay, a new creation. So I want you guys to think about that, the beauty in just that statement, a new creation, okay? A new creation is the rule. Why do I say this?</p><p>It's because then, in contrast, just doctrinal assent, all I know, is that enough? No. Just simply being a part of a group, oh, I am now part of the crew, I am now part of this camp, I am now in this Bible teaching church, is that enough? No. The power of the gospel is so powerful, it causes an individual who was once living according to the flesh, once living in slavery, once living in abject ignorance, to become a new creation in Christ.</p><p>One who was living in anger, one who was living in fits of rage, in all the deeds of the flesh, to one who is going to be living in the newness of Christ. Anything short of that, you know, is not according to the rule, it doesn't measure up. So I want you guys to think about that by way of review over the whole book.</p><p>Chapter four, chapter six, if I can actually summarize the book in a smaller segment, it would be a nonstop contrast to help you see the difference, right? It was like a, hey, do you know what it actually means for you to think that you can abide in this good, holy law?</p><p>Slavery, utter slavery, you can't do it, right? And it was trying to show us, this is the way of the law and this is the way of the Spirit. This is freedom, this is bondage. Do you know the difference? That was the question. Do you guys remember this sloppy little comparison that I put up many weeks ago?</p><p>You don't have to write all this down because I know you know it, you guys memorized it weeks ago, right? This was trying to show us there has been from long ago, ages ago, the way of the flesh, the way of the law, the way of man's own decisions, our own solutions, our own resources, and our own timetable.</p><p>And he gave example after example and one particularly he talked about, back there was the free woman, Sarah, and the bond slave, right? But all of that to us was very convicting because we knew in ourselves there is a huge difference operating and trusting God versus making my own silly, miniature, small, fruitless, empty solutions.</p><p>But can you tell the difference? Can you tell the difference when a false teacher comes to you and say, you gotta be about this new movement of secret friendly, this and this, and this is how you really make the church go, and you're saying, really? All we need to do is have lights?</p><p>All we need to do is have a handsome man preaching short sermons? Where is Christ? This is how we're gonna solve the woes of the society. Is there this and that? All we need to do is be about justice and this? Can you tell the difference with all the movements and all the false teachers that exist today, what is of the flesh and solutions of man versus what actually necessitates Christ?</p><p>And I think one of the strongest convictions as we review Galatians was if there is anything, anything that takes away from the sufficiency and the dire necessity of Christ, that's not faith. That's not gospel. Another example, if even in your own personal life you are struggling with mental health, you're struggling with behavior, you're struggling with this and that, I'm not gonna stand here and say, oh my goodness, all of that is just X, Y, and Z of darkness and demons and the devil, okay?</p><p>But what I'm gonna say is, so what solutions are you looking for? Are you looking for miniature, small, fruitless, empty-vein promises? Or are you looking for greater faith, sanctification, and a newness in Christ? That's something I think is such a challenge and summary of what the book has been trying to show us, right?</p><p>Do you feel like that you simply will have such a better life, that you will be secure if only you belong to a certain community? If you weren't oh so lonely? If you weren't da-da-da-da-da and you had better job, better this and better that? You have to know the difference.</p><p>What is the fleshly solution and what is necessity of Christ, amen? Okay, then in the next, staring at verse 16, so we're looking at the rule. The rule is new creation in Christ, this is the rule. The freedom comes from being in the spirit, walking by the spirit, and it has to be the spirit because it's by faith, and it's by faith because of Christ.</p><p>Christ is all, and therefore, that's the rule, that Christ is all. Now, in looking at this then, he says, in summary, peace and mercy be upon those then who understand this, that who understands looking at Christ is freedom. Now, on a just brief question, we have to ask the question also of what peace and what mercy is he talking about, okay?</p><p>Now, we know that this book in the latter chapters has been talking about application that we need to walk in the spirit, and by walking in the spirit, we're gonna bear the fruits of the spirit, right? So, one of the repeat themes that we hit week after week was this idea that we are going to reap the fruit of the spirit, and here and now, the focus is going to be the peace of God and the mercy of God.</p><p>As you recall, in Galatians 5, it says the fruit of the spirit is love, is joy, is peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, against such thing there is no law. Question, do you as a Christian genuinely value, okay, the treasure of your sanctification and maturity more than anything else, okay?</p><p>And you would have to put that as like, huh, I've never thought about it this way. Some of you guys are in grad school, you've paid tons of money, okay, went into the red to get this degree. Do you value the treasure of your own spiritual maturity, your heart condition of I know how to be content, I know how to have peace, I know how to go through struggle.</p><p>Do you value the growth of your mind, your faith, so much that that is worth more than any degree you could ever earn? Well, scripture says, you know, your sanctification, your spiritual growth is so valuable, it's worth more than any amount of gold. Look at 1 Peter chapter one.</p><p>It's so valuable, bring on all the suffering, because if that produces the treasure and gold of your sanctification, amen. It has proved to be worthwhile. That's the perspective of the Christian. And this book in Galatians, so far in this applicational section, has been all about these fruits must be evident in you, and primarily these, peace and the mercies of God.</p><p>Remember in Philippians, it says, rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I say, rejoice. Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near, be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication. With thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p><p>How valuable is that? To be able to have joy in all situations, and to be able to have a resource where we can take all our anxiety at the foot of the cross. And so he says in verse 12, I know how to get along with humble means. I also know how to live in prosperity.</p><p>In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being fulfilled. Going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. May this be the treasure that is blessed for the Christian. When we are parents, we want our kids to have all things. We want them to have good education, we want to have physical health, and sometimes parents are most worried about their kids having good friends.</p><p>So much so, I'm guessing, that some of your parents went overboard, right? Overboard, and started asking kids, like, can you be friends with my son? Can you be friends with my daughter? And you're like, mom, what the heck? You can't artificially make them, force them to be my friends.</p><p>But the love of the parents do that, right? That is earthly love. We don't fault that because we get it, but it's just so earthly. If you think about, if you think about Galatians, it's interesting because the major problem that is facing this church is a temptation to compromise the gospel, why?</p><p>Because they thought they were gonna be ostracized. They weren't gonna be accepted. They weren't gonna be holy people. It's really interesting, right? But may it be our ambition, just like Apostle Paul's ambition, that the greatest blessing would not be that we, or our brothers and sisters, or even our children, be blessed simply with acceptance from the world, but rather, they would know this secret, amen?</p><p>Next. In verse 16, there is this interesting portion where it says, be upon them, and be upon the Israel of God. Now, initially, I was gonna just say like a statement on this, but I was very curious. So please, as I ask you, let's do audience participation, okay? Who is the Israel of God?</p><p>I'm not gonna call on anyone specifically, 'cause that'd be kinda messed up, to be like, give us your answer, right? But let's take a vote. Cast your vote, okay? I want you guys to raise your hands. Oh, I just realized my numbering's off, because that was another one that I erased.</p><p>Anyway. (laughs) Number one, okay? Does the Israel of God mean all believers, Jews and Gentiles, meaning the New Testament church, or does it mean the elect specifically, the descendants of Abraham physically, elect Israelites who will be saved? Those who think it's number one, raise your hand. Okay, okay. There's a good number of you.</p><p>Those who think it's number three, raise your hand. Okay, okay. And then a bunch of you did not heed my request, and you did not participate, okay? Okay, actually, if you saw the hands, there was a good amount of people who thought it was one, and a good amount of people who thought it was three.</p><p>I am going to take five minutes to talk about this, because in the book of Galatians, this is like an interpretive point, but also, this particular passage, chapter six, verse 16, is used by those who believe number one as a primary passage, meaning it's one of the most common passages that they point to, saying, see?</p><p>We are the new Israel, we're spiritual Israel, okay? However, whenever you're taking a look at interpretive struggles, you want to look at, first, the specific passage itself. You do analysis of the immediate text, okay? So we take a look at this, and we ask this question. So clearly, here, sorry, we have those who take this rule and walk by it, as many as, okay?</p><p>So who is it referring to? If we're talking as many people who would do this, believe on Christ as the only way to be a new creation, to be sanctified, which is the promise of the gospel. We're then talking about probably Gentiles, anybody, right? These, okay, them, may peace and mercy be upon them, and on the Israel of God, okay?</p><p>So you have this Greek term, and, which is just a conjunction, and then the Israel of God. My point being, would be, my argument to you on the analysis of this text, that the and actually creates a distinction, not a unity. The and puts two categorical references, and then says, here they are, which means that there are as many as, and Israel, which means there are two separate people.</p><p>Does that make sense? Just like, as an example, if I say, Mark and Bia are blessed as one in marriage, you would never say that Bia is the new Mark. Yes, even though she is my better half, and all of that, and yes, spiritually we are one, because before God we are, and yes, we are joined together in an unbreakable covenant, we are still two distinct people, yes?</p><p>So I think the immediate text actually shows us otherwise, otherwise it would be very redundant. If I say, as many as, okay, meaning both Jews and Greeks, I mean, Jews and Gentiles, and also the Jews, that would be redundant in a weird way of saying it. The other way that you would expect it to be read is, as many as, right, namely, Israel, or you wouldn't even see a conjunction, you would just have like a parenthetical statement, okay?</p><p>Now, the reason why I bring this up, because in the book of Galatians, it's always good to take a look at the letter, the whole book, right? Not just one passage, but the whole letter. It says a lot about this whole idea of is the New Testament church Israel?</p><p>Abraham, while being physically the father of the Israelites is genuinely spiritually the father of those who believe, is a statement found in Galatians, namely here. Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. 100% agree, why? Because it's the Bible. I believe if you are of faith, you are in the line of Abraham, why?</p><p>Because the scripture said that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and preach the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying all the nations will be blessed in you, so then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer, right? And the scripture tried to show us that Abraham actually, before he was even circumcised, was already accredited because of his faith, and therefore, if you're of faith, you are in his line, yes?</p><p>The other passage in Galatians chapter three said, for you are all sons of God through faith in Jesus Christ, and therefore, verse 29, if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise, 100% agree. You have the blessing, you have the heir, like sonship, you have therefore the promises.</p><p>Those are all yours without any doubt or hindrance. Praise the Lord for the gospel. Other parts of scripture, now what we do is a systematic. Do other parts of scripture agree with this? Yes. In Romans chapter two, it tells us he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision, which is one outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, yes?</p><p>What is he saying? That not all physical descendants of Abraham are spiritual descendants, why? Because you have to have faith, right? There is no individual who's gonna be a descendant who does not have faith, okay? But here then is the big question. This is the way that the question will phrase itself or how the argument will set up.</p><p>Since we are spiritual children of Abraham by faith, and two, not all physical descendants of Abraham are actually spiritual descendants of Abraham, then is the New Testament church the new Israel, okay? And the answer is no, you went too far. You drove way too far with it, okay? It's too far for you to say that therefore the church absorbed or fulfilled or superseded or replaced Israel.</p><p>To make that argument is to follow this diagram. The blue circle is all of Israel, okay? Clearly, they're not all saved. But within Israel, there is a remnant who will believe upon the gospel. These little dots represent the nations. Gentiles just means ethnic. They're different people groups. They come into the big house, the church, which is now the New Testament entity.</p><p>This, therefore, here is the new Israel, okay? But that's not the case. We have not proven, there's so many things that we did not prove. We did not prove that God has spiritualized all of his physical promises to the nation of Israel. He had promise of blessing. He gave them promise that they'd be a great nation.</p><p>He promised them land. He promised them that they would have a leadership role in the kingdom of God. Are all of these things realized? Or were they simply absorbed in the church since the church is a new Israel? None of those passages prove any of that. There are 73 references to Israel in the New Testament.</p><p>None of them call the church the new spiritual Israel. We did not prove that God absorbed Israel into the general body of believers, or we did not prove that God has no other plans for that particular nation in the future. We proved none of that. Why does this matter?</p><p>Why am I taking time to do this? It's in line, it's in line with the nature of the book of Galatians, which is we have to have such a gratitude of the greatness and the grandeur of the mystery. God gave specific promises to a chosen people, and he allowed you and I, who are far off, to come get blessed, right?</p><p>Ephesians chapter two says, you know, you had no commonwealth of Israel, you had no God, you had no hope, yes? You had nothing. But we were able to receive the blessings, we were able to receive the promises of the inheritance, and you were brought near because the incredible gospel message that you too can be adopted into the household of God.</p><p>But it would be strange, it would be too far for the adopted child to look at the natural born, firstborn, and say, you know what? I'm actually the firstborn. I'm natural and you are not. That would be strange, yes? And the reason why this matters is because this question was actually addressed in other parts of scripture.</p><p>Now, I'm gonna read to you a last couple of verses, and then I'll summarize that point. In Romans chapter 11, after Apostle Paul makes this long argument that salvation is by the sovereign choice of God because it's by mercy, right? Then he starts to describe how the Israelites he rejected, the Israelites rejected God.</p><p>He says, I stuck out my hand all day long to an obstinate people. They're the ones who rejected me. And there's this question. So then, God has not rejected his people, has he? Who is he talking about? Physical Israel. May it never be, for I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p><p>He's talking about his biological, physical lineage. Number two, or verse two. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or do you not know what the scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel. Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have torn down your altars, and I alone am left.</p><p>And they are seeking my life. But what is the divine response? I have kept for myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. In the same way, then, there has also come to be at the present time, a remnant, according to God's gracious choice. Following down just a little bit longer into Romans chapter 11, verse 17.</p><p>Okay, Romans chapter 11, 17. This is what he says. But if some of the branches were then broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches.</p><p>But if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root. The root supports you. You guys follow along what he's saying, right? You are a wild branch from another tree who has been grafted into the main tree. And if you all of a sudden think we are the main stem, you're actually being arrogant.</p><p>Verse 19. You will say, then, branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in? Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear, for if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</p><p>Behold, then, the kindness and severity of God, to those who fell severity, but to you, God's kindness. If you continue in his kindness, otherwise, you will also be cut off. Verse 27. This is my covenant with them. When I take away their sin. From the standpoint of the gospel, there are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God's choice, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.</p><p>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Who is he thinking about? The fathers to whom he has made promise. So the promises of nation, the promises of land, the promises of a role within God's kingdom, he actually has those in mind. Why? God doesn't have to spiritualize anything.</p><p>Why? Because he will actually keep them. Verse 30. For just as you were once disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you, they also may now be shown mercy, for God has shut up all in disobedience, so that he may show mercy to all.</p><p>Earlier I said this matters. Why? Because there's supposed to be in our hearts, particularly as Gentiles, an incredible, like, mind-blowing, say what? Here is this tree which is symbolic of the nation of Israel. To them are the blessing. To them are the inheritance. To them is the promise. And we get to be grafted into them.</p><p>That's the humble posture of appreciation for adopted children. It should look like this. We had earlier the arrow pointing the other way. They need to come into this new entity. But scripture actually says, "No, no, no, you don't understand. "You get to be a part of their plan." Does that make sense?</p><p>The arrow goes reverse. And so that's why the scripture said in Ephesians, "This is an incredible mystery of God." That the Gentiles could approach God. The Gentiles could actually have God through Christ, a relationship, where yes, just like a son, I could go to my father. I could look forward to the promises that I would have fulfillment in everything in Christ.</p><p>That is a true, true blessing. And so with that said, I wanted to just highlight that because if you think about the book of Galatians in grand summary, he was trying to show us just what a treasure our salvation is in Christ. That no other temptation of glory, good showing, of approval of man or anything, even the world, could have any sway on us, amen?</p><p>And so that being the case, I wanna wrap up with verse 17. Sorry, that was a long detour, okay? In verse 17, he makes this statement, "From now on then, let no one cause trouble for me, "for I bear on my body the brand marks of Jesus." I have a question for you.</p><p>How did you take that? What is he actually saying, right? "From now on, let no one cause me trouble." How did you picture him saying that? I will be honest, this is the way I read it. "Don't mess with me, I'm crazy, you see?" And he's just like showing them his scars, right?</p><p>It kinda sounds like don't mess with me, right? You don't wanna know how serious I am. Now, in some sense, he could say that. I mean, Apostle Paul was so gung-ho. Apostle Paul is the apostle, you know? Planter of churches, missionary to afar. And in some sense, he has every right to be like, "You know what, all you guys, you guys need to be quiet.</p><p>"I'm done talking about this." And in some sense, in other parts of scripture, he actually commands, "You know what? "If anybody is teaching a different gospel, "make sure they stay quiet." And any defiance of teaching is so bad for the community, it's like gangrene, rebuke them harshly, and the second time they do it, kick 'em out, right?</p><p>So is that the message? I think another way to look at it is because he particularly, or I guess specifically says that he, right, "I don't want you to trouble me," for, "because I have the brand marks of Christ," he is actually saying something a little different. Close, but a little different.</p><p>The emphatic point is, "I belong to Christ," right? The emphatic point is, "You can try. "Don't test me. "You already have, actually. "Look at my back. "You've pushed me. "You've tried to bend me. "I don't belong to you or the world. "I belong to Christ." Wow, what a challenge.</p><p>I pray that we would have the same kind of conviction where we can say with him, "I have been crucified with Christ. "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. "The life which I now live in the flesh, "I live by faith in the Son of God, "who loved me and gave himself up for me." This, he says, is his identity.</p><p>"I have been identified by the brand marks of Christ. "I so belong to Christ. "I so belong to the Lord that I bear his branding." That's an amazing statement. And again, I go back to this idea. How many times throughout our study did we talk about, "Hey, do you guys struggle with the fear of man?" You remember back when we started talking about Apostle Peter and how he succumbed to the pressure and he's like, "Yeah, maybe we don't eat with them." He started withdrawing.</p><p>And then we think about the pressures of the people, how he would say those false teachers, they just like making a good showing, so what are they concerned with? The eyes of the people. But Apostle Paul, remember, way at the beginning in chapter one, verse 10, he said, "Am I now trying to be pleasing in the eyes of men "or of God?</p><p>"If I were trying to be pleasing to men, "I would not be a servant of Christ." Wow. I pray that this book was challenging to you. In however you want to present yourself to the world, in however you want to be accepted at school, at work, and in your family, and even at church, I pray we would be so bold.</p><p>My identity is in Christ. And let that be the power that we live by every day. Amen? Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord God, actually, if we feared you more, but what's another way to put it, God, if we just loved you so much, and if we experienced the satisfaction of being in Christ in such a way, God, we know the secret of being content in every single situation.</p><p>Lord, there would be a lot of drama and a lot of pain we could avoid. In this letter, they're receiving so much harsh rebuke, a tone of urgency, and in many ways, a shaking up, because, God, they succumb to the pressures of wanting to belong to a certain sect of self-righteous people.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that we would be humble enough to know we are all susceptible to that. And then, God, in humility, help us just to pursue Christ with everything we have. I ask that, God, we would voluntarily and we would readily be identified with Christ, whatever consequences it may mean.</p><p>And in that way, Lord, I pray that our church would be pleasing in your sight. We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen. Listen, because we hit upon a couple different things, I am gonna take just like two, three minutes of questions. Do you guys have any questions about the stuff we covered today, including the, you know, are we the New Testament Israel, or things like that?</p><p>The passage in the Book of Galatians that was difficult for you guys? Please know that, yes. Go ahead, just yell it out, I'll hear you. (faintly speaking) , yeah. (faintly speaking) Yeah, so do you guys hear the question? Back in the portion where it was giving us the trail of thought, we have like freedom, there's Hagar, there's et cetera, and then he mentions, but if you think about it, like you follow the context of that line he was saying, there is a physical Jerusalem, right?</p><p>But also there's like physical Mount Sinai, physical da-da-da-da-da. And if an individual, that line is talking about, there are people who believe, like having, right? Like physical blessings, there are people who believe in solutions of, if I take a trip to the Mecca, you know? It'd be very similar to seeking earthly blessings and finding earthly security because you have earthly things.</p><p>And he's trying to make the point, you're free from all that. There is a heavenly mindedness, a spiritual mindedness, right? So the point that I'm making is, if you want to use that argument to, let's say, draw an analogy to why the New Testament church is Israel, there's like a need for a greater line because those two thoughts are actually quite separate, right?</p><p>The point that he's making versus the question of our identity, they're two separate lines. Does that make sense? Okay, we could talk after. Okay, cool. Well, you know, how about we do it this way? If you guys have questions and stuff like that, please feel free to ask. That's kind of a quite long running question and debate, right?</p><p>And in some sense, in my mind, it's very simple, right? We get to receive the blessings. Amazing, right? God fulfills all of his promises to them. Amazing. That's it. But the questions, because we're trying to reconcile so much of scripture, I understand there's room for debate there. Please know that our doors are open to you, okay?</p><p>Well, I'll turn it over to Pastor Peter for announcements. Can we thank Pastor Mark for leading us this? It takes a lot to prepare just for the Bible study, so when you guys get a chance, please say thank you to Pastor Mark for leading us through the latter three chapters.</p><p>This is our final Bible study, so I do have a few announcements to make, and then just a couple reminders, okay? The FAM245 Barbecue is this Saturday, so if you guys have been married three years and under, that's for you. The Women's Softball, the fellowship is on Sunday, but there's been a change.</p><p>It isn't at T. Winkle Park. It's at Steve Ambrese Park in Orange, so if you guys, if you're a lady and you already were planning to do softball, you guys should already know this. If not, just go on our app and then find the contact people, and then they'll let you know.</p><p>Next week, we aren't meeting on Wednesday for Bible study, but we are gonna meet for praise and prayer, and the praise and prayers weren't just for like a break from the Bible study. It was actually a time where we get together, really, to pray corporately for things, so it's just as important as the Bible study, right?</p><p>And this year's theme is pray in the spirit, and so not just for the summer, but going forward, if there's a praise and prayer, please do prioritize that, 'cause that's the only time that we really get together on a monthly basis just to lift up the needs of the church.</p><p>(silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence)</p></div></body></html>
