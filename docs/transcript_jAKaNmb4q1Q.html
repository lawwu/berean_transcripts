Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. The next announcement is for a class I'll be running specifically within biblical counseling, helping those who are struggling with sexual sins or addictions.</p><p>Let's do everything. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, offering called the Lottie Moon Offering. So please take time to consider 100% of the proceeds goes to mission work. We've been working with the IMB, and we really want to encourage you guys to set apart just time to pray, pray for evangelism overseas, and then contribute.</p><p>If you'd like to submit a contribution to it, please make sure that it's separate. You make a memo that it's for the Lottie Moon, separate from your regular offering. Okay, so if you have, we're going to go into offering time now. If you do have a physical check, we have a box right at the entrance.</p><p>Let's all bow together in prayer. Our God and Father, we are so thankful to you. We're grateful that you give to us the light of your word, revelation. You are such a giving God. You've given to us wonders and miracles. You've given to us prophets of old. Ultimately, you've given to us your own son.</p><p>You are a God who bears the cost. You're a God who continues to sacrifice. And so we are so grateful. We pray that even then in the offering and the worship, everything we're doing, it would truly be the expression of our thankful hearts to you. And we pray, Father God, God, that you would allow us continued opportunities then to engage the work that you are doing.</p><p>And we do pray that the offering we give would be used for your kingdom work, for your gospel ministry. And then also, Lord, right now, we pray for this time we have, in the short time we have, to sing, to study your word, to pray together as a church.</p><p>Bless us, God. Bless us with conviction. Bless us, Father God, with your presence in Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us before we continue. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.</p><p>Amen. Amen. One day when heaven. One day when heaven is filled with its praises. One day when sin was as black as could be. Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin. Dwelled to all men now in St. Louis here. The world became flesh. The light shined among us.</p><p>His glory ran in heaven. Living in love. Dying to save me. Every day when sin's far away. Rising to justify. Freely born. One day when He's dying. One day when He's dying. One day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying.</p><p>All day when He's dying. He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. All day when He's dying. Thank you. God bless me, every beginning, my sins fall away, rising in justice, free for your love, my death is coming, oh, we will stay, oh, we will stay.</p><p>One day the grave could conceal the world no longer, one day the storm goes away from the door. Then be a world's old, I feel high, low is ascended, my Lord evermore. The death of the loiter, the good of the people, rising out there. God bless me, every beginning, my sins fall away, rising in justice, free for your love.</p><p>God bless me, every beginning, my sins fall away, rising in justice, free for your love. God bless me, every beginning, my sins fall away, rising in justice, free for your love. God bless me, every beginning, my sins fall away, rising in justice, free for your love.

Crowned in all His praise, all earth and heaven and sea For He is the Lord who reigns in majesty Over Thee He has been, worthy He will be Over Thee He is great, worthy He will be Over Thee He is great, worthy He will be Amen, baby, see you Let's please turn our Bibles over to Psalm chapter 19, verse 12 Psalm chapter 19, verse 12 It is a more well-known and famous psalm And we'll just take the last ending of it In the little paragraph, verse 12-14 The Word of God reads Who can discern His errors?</p><p>Equip me of hidden faults Also keep back your servant from presumptuous sins Let them not rule over me Then I will be blameless And I shall be acquitted of great transgression Let the words of my mouth And the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight O Lord, my rock and my redeemer Let's pray Lord, we again want to come before You Just completely humbled and grateful Father God, You minister to us in ways That we sometimes do not fully appreciate And couldn't have even asked for We know, God, we're undeserving And yet You continue to grace us with Your light and truth We pray this morning that as we hear Your Word Grant to us a greater measure of sanctification Continue to lead us in righteousness And more so, do all this work Renewing our minds, renewing our souls And causing our faith to grow We thank You in Christ's name Amen So, as we live our Christian lives There's a sense in which there's a bit of a paradox On one hand, as we grow We are growing in joy We're growing in just happiness and blessedness We're seeing how God is maturing us We're seeing His work in our lives And so, greater joy More reasons to rejoice But on the flip side There is going to be a growing kind of frustration A strange grieving of the heart And the reason why is That as you grow in knowledge, truth, faith God bears light into your life And then you see more and more of the sin That lurks in all the different recesses Of your mind and heart We recognize also that Even if you try to grow repeatedly And gain discipline Sometimes you can revert back Sometimes you'll commit the same sins And even when you know better In such frustrating fashion Even when you know better Even when it's illogical You still do things that you know God is displeased by And I can liken this a little bit To moving and unboxing Like, you know, trying to get settled in Into the house Because recently I moved And that's pretty much where my mind is Half the time You pack stuff You move You get in there You have a stack of boxes Sometimes it's fun Because then you open it up And you're like Huh, I never knew I had this Other times It's just frustrating, isn't it?</p><p>It's like Gosh, I wish I could just throw it all away And then the funny thing about it is You unbox one And then you unbox another And it's like Why do we have two? And then all this stuff starts to come out And you even forget That you had that thing And in the same way You can experience Christian life Where the more you grow The more God's light is shined And you grow in the scriptures Sometimes you worship Sometimes you even have intense moments of spirituality And yet there's this ongoing sin Which is so frustrating Have you felt it?</p><p>My guess is you have Especially if you've grown up in the church And for me, thank God I was saved when I was young In high school Near the end And I remember having that immediate frustration Of why God I just went to the retreat I had multiple sermons I was saturated in fellowship I loved it And I felt your love for me Only to come down from the mountain Two days later And fall into some kind of silly sin Or even in college Maybe you're actually serving Or you're involved at church You're involved in campus ministry And you make huge movement of devotion Like I'm going to be committed to you And then regularly You have to confess like the same sins Have you felt that kind of frustration?</p><p>The question is What do you do when you see it? Because in context In context of chapter 19 King David took time Actually to glory in God He was looking at creation and saying The heavens are declaring your glory He was saying The sun is talking about your might And it touches everything And then he meditated On not just creation But on God's word And he said Your word is pure Your word is righteous It refreshes my soul It's perfect But then his thought went to And the ministry of your word is so good It warns my soul It warns your servant And then immediately He got an awareness of himself Frustrating But look Look at the vast array Of the kinds of sin I have Look at all these different things That I do And the psalm ends With first Just this glory of God And his truth How wonderful the ministry Of the scriptures are To oh my goodness And so today We're looking actually At King David's prayer We're in the midst Of the sight of his sin The fact that even now I still sin He's praying He's praying And longing For purity He's praying And begging God For his protection And he's praying That his life Mouth Heart Everything Would be pleasing In the sight of God And in this is the context Where we get this This line May the words of my mouth And the meditation Of my heart Be acceptable in your sight Oh Lord my rock And my redeemer So as we meditate on this First The first point we go to Is to set the stage Of the problem This frustration That King David Is talking about The frustration Of the ongoing sins In our lives Do you hear the tone And he's talking When he says Who can discern his errors Equip me of hidden faults Keep back your servant From presumptuous sins Let them not rule over me Then I will be blameless And I shall be acquitted Of great sins Do you hear the tone In him just asking the question Like who Who even is capable Of understanding Their own sins Who can discern Their own heart It's so frustrating And the answer Is basically nobody And so in some way I want you to picture The frustration Of unboxing something And perhaps You've been in it Where you're looking For something If you just move And you're like How am I going to find Amongst all these boxes Where is it But also picture this If you're so frustrated You take the box And what do you do Just And you lay it all On the floor Right Because in the frustration You notice There's so many Different categories There's errors And there's hidden faults There's presumptuous sins And there's blames And there's sins That rule over you And there's great transgression What you feel Is the frustration Of an individual Who is very Very aware Super aware And I want to tell you You know In the world of counseling That's half The battle Is trying to help Somebody see You know Your sins Are not Just this one Thing you did There are sins That are of the heart There are sins That are of the mind The sins of your volition And your desires And then yes There are habituated sins That you've learned over time You got so accustomed to And then there's contextual sins Where you're just mimicking The guy next to you There are so many Different categories of sin Well what are some Of these categories That he delineates for us The first You know Underneath this idea Of the problem Of our ongoing sins Is that first We have a lot of errors In our lives And he is talking About unintentional sins Things in which We transgress God's law Or we do things That are displeasing To him Or we do things That are hurtful ways But these are unintentional And just as a reality check I mean Because we're not Aware of them Obviously We may assume Just like You know I've been living my life I've been keeping the narrow But King David The way he's thinking Is These things are all around us And I recognize Actually There is a subtle Defensiveness That's even In my heart If I'm minding My own business Doing devos Doing the church thing Walking with Christ And someone comes And correct me It's like Whoa, whoa, whoa That's a you problem Not me Those are some Of the defensive thoughts We have What's more If someone Let's say Comes and That's a very Stereotypical situation Oh you did this And it was hurtful Our typical Natural defense That goes up Is Well I didn't Meaning King David Is not Excusing himself Because there was Oh There was no Intentionality Right No he's saying There are things That are just Objectively things God is displeased by And there are errors And I need to know Them But the trouble is Who can discern All this Help me Question Do you have A defensive attitude Do you have Some of that Like so long as I didn't intend to It's not wrong Or Are you so willing To receive The correction Of the people Around you Better yet You're willing To ask For the critique It feels so Not good When someone Critiques us But better You're asking For what Are some things That I'm doing I need to work on I'm just kind of Oblivious to The second It sounds so similar But he says There are hidden Faults within us And in Just first Cursory read through Clearly Every single one Of us has Sins We just never Disclosed Clearly A lot of us Are Very private I'm very private When I struggle With certain things It just takes So much To randomly Bring up Hey by the way You want to Hear something I have a hard Time with X Y and Z I mean it just Seems so awkward And there is A false Machismo Maybe you can say I mean do you Think this way It's like It's my problem I need to deal With it Yes I'm not saying That that's wrong But nevertheless It is our habit To have certain Things we struggle With Not tell anybody And think You know what I'm just going to Grow and steadily Mature past this And scripture And scripture Tells us That's not How it works Scripture tells us That the logic Is if you Cannot disclose If you cannot Reveal and bring To light Things even To a real Person You probably Will not Confess it To God That's why God says Confess your Sins to Your brother And from Personal experience I Obviously The word of God has always Proven tribute to But from Personal experience I know that's Also the way In my life I falsely Assume I can Hide things Because I'm Just going to Grow out of it Not realizing Dude Ultimately I even hide That from my God Betraying The basic Thing that I Know God sees All His piercing Eyes Seize my Intentions My hearts And his Word Lays bare My soul What am I Doing But upon A second Closer look At this text I'm not sure If like the Hiding and the Secrecy is Exactly what He's after Because he Is moving From incremental Growth Like things That are Errors To things That are Hidden And what I want to Talk about Is there Are sins By which We are Actually Not aware Perhaps Because we Have desensitized Our senses Right What do I Mean Sometimes When sin Is allowed To be a Pattern Of your Life For so Long Your Does The senses That God Has given You It doesn't Go off Saying it's Wrong It's wrong It's wrong It just Feels Natural So how Many times Have we Seen Individuals Excuse Certain sins Because it Just seems Like second Nature It just Seems So natural This is Unfortunately Some of The defensive Words that We hear From Again Maybe the More Pagan Cultural Things that Are happening If this Is second Nature How can It be Wrong It's still Wrong King David Is one Who is Aware That When there Is such A pattern Maybe Perhaps There are Multiple Layers Of Desensitizing Our senses You just Don't Know So many Layers Of Justification So many Layers Of Suppressing Suppressing Suppressing And you Guys know Exactly King David's Story I'm not Going to Recount The whole Thing But he Was in Such a Situation Where he Had some Egregious Incredibly Heinous Sins And yet When Nathan Came to Him And said You know There's This story It was Complete Setup There was Such a Man in Power And there Was such An Individual Took His Only Sheep And then King David Responds Like how Dare He You're The man How Does he Get There Perhaps Layers And layers Of But I Fought Hard And I Deserve Rest I'm King But I Can Even If I Sin The Nation Needs Me Whatever Is a Rationalization So many Layers Can Desensitize You Where You're No Longer Aware And King David Says Even if I don't Feel The Conviction That's A Hidden Sin I Need To Repent Of And you Know Within The Context Of This He Mentions Later Let The Words Of My Mouth And we Recognize That If there Is a Way By which Because We're So Accustomed To It We May Feel Like It's Not Wrong It's Probably If You Have Just An Impatient Tongue You Have Anger And Typically Your words Come out Reactionary To Situations And Then Only After You've Spoken Sometime Later You're Like Probably Shouldn't Have Those Are Probably The Things That King David Is Talking About Things That Are Blind Spots For Us Things That Have Been Habituated Things That Because Even A Blind Spot Of Culture Everybody Talks This Way Everybody Watches This Everybody Da da da da da And That Becomes A Blind Spot Because We're Not So Easily Convicted By It Well Rather Than Reacting In A Way Where We're Defensive Rather Than Reacting In A Way Where We're Making Excuses A Quick Challenge Here As King David Says Equip Me Of Everything We Take A Moment To Pause And Just Praise God Praise God That When An Individual Holistically Devotes His Life To Christ And Says Wash Me Praise God That Christ Forgives Everything Every Single Thing There Are Things That We're Not Aware And There Are Things That Even Though Like We Know It's Wrong Time Passes And And And We We Don't Repent Of It Praise God That Our Lord Jesus Covers All With His Blood The Next Category He Says There Are Presumptuous Sins Not Just Errors Not Just Hidden Faults But Then There Are Presumptuous Sins What Are These In An Initial Thought I Thought Presumptuous Things Are When You Just Assume Your Goal I'm Good And You Just Do Stuff Hastily Right Doesn't Matter Nobody Cares I'm Just Going To Do It In Presumption We Just Think You Know What If I Mess Up I'm Just Going To Ask For Apology Later I'll Ask For For For For For For For Those Are The Thought That Go Through Our Minds When We Make Impulsive Decisions Is That What He's Talking About When We Presume I Think That's Fine Okay But The Word That He Uses Is Actually A Bit More Intense Because The Word Means High Handed It's A Raising It's A Swollen Pride It's An Insolent Person It's A Person Who Is Self Willed And To Show This To You I Want To Take You To A Passage In Exodus Chapter 21 Verse 13 Through 14 What It Means To Be Presumptuous This Is A Story That's Really Well Known To Us But You Know After Reviewing I Forgot The Second Part Of The Story What Am I Talking About Well We All Know That After Coming Out Of Egypt The People Were Grumbling The People Had Doubt And One Of The Great Fail That They Had Was God Said Go Into The Land Of Canaan I Am With You I Am Going To Fight For You It's Not Even You But Unfortunately The People Saw They Said The Land Is Flowing With Milk And Honey The Fruit Everything It's Giant It's Huge But Look The People Are Giant But Look We're Going To Die If We Fight Against These People They Get Scared They Run Back And They Say Oh My Goodness God Brought Us To This Point And We're Just Going To Die Joshua Caleb Was Like What Are We Doing We Got To Go In There Now Pick up The Story Here In Exodus Chapter 21 Verse 13 Oh Sorry The Next Pass Is Deuteronomy Chapter 1 Verse 41 Okay Deuteronomy Chapter 1 Verse 41 And Look What He Says As Moses Is Recounting That Situation He Says Then You Said To Me We Have Sinned Against The Lord We Will Indeed Go Up And Fight Just As The Lord Our God Commanded Us And Every Man Of You Girded On His Weapons Of War Regarded As Easy To Go Up Into The Hill Country And Then The Lord Said To Me Say To Them Do Not Go Up Nor Fight For I Am Not Among You Otherwise You Will Be Defeated Before Your Enemies So I Spoke To You But You Would Not Listen Instead You Rebelled Against The Commandment Of The Lord And Acted Presumptuously And Went Up Into The Hill Country The Amorites Who Lived In That Hill Country Came Out Against You And Chased You As Bees Do Crust You From Ser To Hormon Then Returned And Wept Before The Lord But The Lord Did Not Listen To Your Voice Nor Give Ear To You So The Way That It Uses The Word Presumptuously Is The Thought Of You're So Self Will First You Failed By Fear But Then Second That Wasn't Repentance Like Okay Okay Now We'll Do It No You God Was Telling Them I'm Not Going With You And They Said No It's Gonna Go It's Gonna Happen I'm Not Going With You No It's Gonna Be Easy So Let Me Give You A Challenge Right Now I Don't Know All That You're Going Through And Let Me Just Make A Blanket Statement If You're Receiving Counsel And Wise Counsel Said Don't Do This But Half Of You Is Just Like No But I Want It Do Not Make Hasty Decisions If The Light Of God Is Given To You And He's Giving You Some Warnings Like I Don't Know If God Is Pleased By This Do Not Just Shrug Your Shoulders And Go At It That Would Be So Detrimental To You But So Many Times If You Think About Our Sins What Sins Aren't Like That You Know Where You Hear That Conscience Going Off Like This Is A Little Compromising Ah It's Going To Be Fine But You Know There's Another Area Where This Word Is Used And That Word Is Used In Exodus Chapter 21 Verse 13 The Second Example Okay Exodus Chapter 21 Verse 13 And This Is Moses Giving The Law And In Giving The Law It Says But If He Did Not Lie In Wait For Him But God Let Him Fall Into His Hand Then I Will Appoint You A Place To Which He May Flee If However A Man Acts Presumptuously Toward His Neighbor So As To Kill Him Craftily You Are To Take Him Even From My Altar That He May Die Whoa What's He Saying Within The Law Of God There Is A Distinguishing There Are Sins In Which People Fall Into Your Indiscretion People Fall Into Things That You Were Maybe Haphazard And Therefore They Suffer The Consequences Of Your Irresponsibility Okay That's Very Different From What Premeditated Murder What Is This You Scheming Okay As I Think About This There Is A Question When We Sin Do We Get Crafty When We Sin Do We Scheme The Answer Is Yes If We Are Humble About The Nature Of Our Sins There Are Thoughts In Our Minds That Are Not Just Joking Daydreaming Or Fantasizing But Sometimes It's Planning I'm Going to Give You A Silly Example And Take The Word Here To Be Humble Myself And Confess To You Something That's Going On In My Mind Again It's Related To Moving Some Of How Is I Love It I Love It So Much I'm Only Five Minutes Away From Church Just Crossed The Bridge Underneath The 55 And I'm There And I Loved It So Much I'm So Enthusiastic But I Come Home And Late At Night Parking Is Horrible Everybody's Home Do You Live In A Situation Like That Where You Have To Drive Around For Parking That Kind Of Thing And Then This Guy He Always Parks Right In Front Of My House And I'm Sitting There Just Mad Dogging Him Like What's Wrong With You Go Park In Your Old House All These Thoughts Are Going Through My Mind But Of Course I've Got This Conviction Dude I'm His New Neighbor I Gotta Go Say Hi To Him I Say Hi Like Hey Man I Even Tell Him Straight Off The I'm Just A Pastor At A Church Nearby And Then I Say But Dude You Think You Do Me A Favor Park Over There You It's Right Here In Front Of My House You Know Please Don't Please Refrain I've Even Got My Elderly In-Laws Living With Me You Know I'm Just Giving Him My Whole Spiel He Looks At Me And He Goes Sorry Buddy Public Parking What Are You Talking About And Then I Felt This Rage Just Come Up In Me And I Even Had To Tell Bia I Don't Understand Why I So Angry I'm So Happy About This House I'm So Happy We Moved In Why Am I So Angry And My Boys Are Asking Me Like How Are You Going To Get This Guy To Stop Parking In Front Of Our House And I Sittled There Like Could Slash His Tire I Don't Know And Then I'm Confessing To You The Reason Why I Know I'm Scheming Is Because I'm Like No No That's Too Obvious We Gotta Do Something More Subtle Put Some Sugar In His Gas Tank I Mean We Just Did Some Renault We Could Put A Screw In This House I Do There Snails Everywhere Around Here It's Bad Sometimes I Shock Myself But I Tell You That Silly Confession Because In What Sin Have I Not Schemed To Do Ultimately What I Want But Then My Defenses Come Up Do You Know What I Typically Say In The Mists Of Sin You Say You Know It Just Heat Of The Moment Thing And It Was Just Circumstantial And We All Know It's His Fault I Mean The Mind And The Level Of Rationalization Is Wild I Am Confessing That To You In The Same Way King David Is Looking At His Heart And So Aware I Have Such A Category An Array Of Sin Not Just Talking About The Different Kind Of Sins But How The Depth Of Sin I Am Capable Of High Handed Willful Rebellion While I'm The Servant Of The Lord That's What He's Saying In Humility He's Looking At The Scripture And Realizing I'm Susceptible Of All Of This I See It So Remember At The Beginning I Asked The Question What Do We Do In The Most Of That In The Frustration What Do We Do In The Shock Of Seeing Some Of These Things In Our Own Lives We Believers We Pray We Depend And Cling To God In Desperate Request In Humility Of Prayer And The First I Want To Challenge You Is Pray For Purity With Hatred For Sin Okay Pray For Purity With Hatred For Every Kind Of Sin King David Saw The Possibility Of Just Errors Do You Hate Errors Do You Hate The Things That You Are Not Aware Of Do You Hate Even Unintentional Transgressions Do You Hate All Of Or Are We Still In The Midst Of Justifying Those Things As Like My Intentions Are Good Though My Intentions Are Good Though That's Not The Way I Want You To See The Way King David Feels About His Sin If You Turn To Psalm 38 Psalm 38 Starting From Verse 1 Look At The Angst Look At The Frustration Look At The Pain The Pain He Says Oh Lord Rebuke Me Not In Your Wrath And Chasten Me Not In Your Burning Anger For Your Arrows Have Sunken Deep Into Me And Your Hand Has Pressed Down On Me There Is No Sound In My Flesh Because Of Your Indignation There Is No Health Of My Bones Because Of My Sin For My Iniquities Are Gone Over My Head As A Heavy Burden They Weigh Too Much For Me My Wounds Grow Foul And Fester Because Of My Folly I Am Bent Over Greatly Bown Down I Go Mourning All Day Long For My Loins Are Filled With Burning There Is No Soundness In My Flesh I Am Benowned And Badly Crushed I Grown Because Of The Agitation Of My Heart Lord All My Desire Is Before You And My Sighing Is Not Hidden From You This This Is A Great Great Picture Of King David Seeing The Reality As God Sees It This Is King David Feeling The Actual Weight Of His Sins Not Minimized Not Excused Away But Feeling The Full Burden And Saying God You Have To Equip Me Of It All Right God I Desire This Purity And You You Sense The Way That He's Describing Sin It's A Burden It's A Weight It's Painful The Arrows Everything Is Piercing Me And Then Your Judgment Your Eyes Upon That Is Killing Me Do You Have That Kind Of Sentiment Towards Sin Do You Have That Kind Of Hatred Towards Sin Scripture Calls Us That Everybody Who Loves The Lord They Must Hate It They Must Hate Sin Take A Look at Some Of These Passages Romans 12 9 Abhor What Is Evil Cling To What Is Good Psalm 97 10 Hate Evil You Who Love The Lord You Have This Psalm As He Prays It Is More Of An Emotional Experience Of Seeing The Light Of God's Word And Then Immediately Feeling Exposed And Saying God You Have To Cleanse Me I Hate Feeling So Dirty Haven't You Felt It Haven't You Felt The Frustration Of Like Even Just Physically Washing And Realizing Like Gosh I'm Dirty To My Pores And Just One Wash Won't Get It Out And I Have To Wash Again Haven't You Felt It We Christians Carry With Us This Paradox Be Able To Grieve Be Able To Grieve Over Your Sins And Despise That Which Is Wretched I Want To Give You A Really Really Silly Example Which Is Stinky Tofu Okay I Apologize Right Now If Some Of You Guys That's Your Childhood Thing You Love It To Death I I I I I I Hate Stinky Tofu I Believe God Almighty Has Designed Certain Things To Be Repulsive And Wretched There Was A Time A Traumatic Experience When I Was Young My Parents Took Me To A Unskilled Very Very Cheap Dentist Who Worked On My Wisdom To They Pushed It Down Broke It To Pieces But They Left Pieces In There It Got Infected I Could Smell The Infection Growing And Growing I Tried To Do The Squeegee Thing It Wasn't Working And I Could Smell The Stench Of Infection Coming From My Own Mouth Into My Nostrils That's Stinky Tofu God Has Made It So That Repulsive Smell Let's You Know Don't Eat It And Yet Here Are These Taiwanese Students They're Showing Us Love And They're Like Eat This Try This And I'm Like No No I Don't Want To Try It And All They're Doing Is Trying To Get Me To React And That's How Satan And The World Works With Us They Just Want To See How We Would React To This And You Have To Be Repulsed By It Okay Now With All Joking Aside But Truth Be Told We Regularly To The Line With Simple Things We're Not Willing To Say I Hate That That's Wrong A lot Of Times It's Because We Feel Conviction But Then There's Not An Extra Measure Of Like God In Order To Be Pure I Detest What You Detest I Hate What You Hate And Even If I Didn't Know So What Now That You Know You Have To Put It Aside This Is The Kind Of Prayer That King David Is Praying The Second Prayer That He Says Is A Prayer For Protection He's Asking God Restrain Me I Love The Way He Puts It Keep Me Keep Me From These Things You Hold Me Back And As I Meditated On This I Realized Number One Do I Pray This Regularly Keep Me Back From My Sin And I Have To Confess I Do Not And The Reason Why Is I Actually Had A Really Clear Thought When I Was Younger That Sin Is Like Adultery And Asking God To Help Me With Adultery Is A Double Offense To My God What Do I Mean If God Says Idolatry Is Like You Going To A Mistress Then Asking Him To Help Me Is Like Going To The One Who Has Been Offended Cheated On And Saying Help Me Not To Visit The Mistress Doesn't That Seem Super Wrong That Seems So Wrong That I I Had An Interesting Thought Where I Said In Humility And No In Noble Stature If I Need To Let It Go Then I Let It Go Okay But Then Scripture Teaches Us That Humanly Noble But Not Humble Enough Because The Reality Is You Have No Power Ultimately In Of Yourself There Is No Confidence To Be Delivered From Evil And That Is Why Jesus You Know He Has Commanded Us In The Very Prayer That We're Supposed To Pray In Matthew 6 We're Supposed To Pray Regularly Do Not Lead Us Into Temptation But Deliver Us From Evil For Yours Is The Kingdom Yours Is The Power The Glory Forever Amen True Humility Says I I I Need To Pray For My Bread Today I Can't Even Feed Myself Even Though Yes Everything About The Tangible Workings Of Everyday Meat It Just Says I Just Need To Work Make Money And Feed Myself That That That That All In My Power Is Everything Physical That That Speaks To Us But Scripture Says You Ask God Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread That's Humble So What Do We Do It Sounds It Feels So Weird To Me But You Ask God God Keep Me You Make Sure You Restrain Me Give Me That Powerful Spirit To Keep Me Back From Ruling Sins Don't Let Me Fall Into What I Know Can Become Of Me Where I Make A Habit Once Twice Three Times And It Becomes So Easy To Keep Breaking That Wall I Know That I'm Capable Of The Same So Help Me Cause Me To Be Strengthened So That I Will Resist Temptation With No Confidence In Myself Or My Flesh Keep Me Lord That's His Prayer Protect Me God Are You Praying That Regularly Then Lastly He Prays To Please The Lord He's Praying Obviously With Such Intent Heart I Want To Be Pure I Want To Be Clean Right Let None Of This Filth And Sin Be Attached To Me Or On My Body He And He's Praying Protect Protect Me Protect Me From Any Future Sins Protect Me From All The Stuff That's Going To Come I Know I'm Going To Walk This Earth And All Of This Distraction Is Going To Come All Of This Desire Is Going To Come Out Keep Me Lord And Then He Prays But I Want To Be Pleasing To You A Life That's Acceptable In The Sight Of God Let The Words Of My Mouth The Meditation Of My Heart Be Acceptable In Your Sight I Want To Give You This Challenge Are You Praying In This Way Are You Praying In Such A Way Where Not At The End Of The Day After It's All Happened Saying God Sorry Not At The End Of The Day When Things Have All Gone On You Walked Your Life Etc Meaning After Certain Seasons You Look Back And You Like Yeah I Shouldn't Have Said That At The Beginning Of The Day Praying God Let Everything That Comes Forth From My Heart But Also The Meditation The Daydreams The Intent All That's Ruminating In My Mind Let It Be Pleasing To You Let It Not Just Simply Be Okay For Everybody Let It Not Simply Be What's Average What Everybody Else Is Doing So Long As I'm With With The Pack So I'm So Long As I'm Not Falling Behind But Rather Let It Bring Pleasure To You Let It Rise To You And Be Pleasing To Your Ear Is This The Way The Content Of Your Mind Currently Works Is It Just As A Challenge To You If Right Now We Did That Whole Videotape Of Your Mind Where Your Mind Drifts To What You So Soak In Would It Even Be Presentable You Know With Youth Group You Know What I Do Is Sometimes I See Them On Their Phone And Then Rather Than Go Hey What Are You Watching I Just Slowly Sneak Up Behind Them And Look You Know And Then I'm Like Darn They Got Privacy Screen On They Got That You Protection Thing Where It's All Dark And Like Why Do You Got That Privacy Thing On You Don't Want To Show Anybody You Know And I Tease Them About It And Then They're Like Oh It's Nothing It's Nothing And Then I'm Like Okay Now You Have To Show Me Like No It's Nothing Nothing You Know What's So Funny Is They Show Me And It's Literally Nothing Sometimes They're Just You Know Some Of The Students Are Very Restricted On What They Can Access So They're Just Like Clicking Buttons And Going Through Different Apps Or If They Have Access To Social Media There Are These Shorts It's Just Some Guy Hitting His Head On The Door Post It's Like You Know The Silly Stuff Like Oh Watch This Karen Be Confronted Or Silly Stuff Like Look At This Mall Fight And I'm Sitting There Like It's So Vain And Trivial Why Are You Watching This But Then I Mean By Confession After A Long Day At Night You Take Your Phone You Open It Up And Facebook Just Feeds You That Stuff I Think Facebook Think Because I'm An Angry Person Because Half The Stuff Is Road Rage Crazy You Know Or It's Just So Funny And Then I Realized Gosh This Is The Maybe Satan I Know He Schemes But Maybe We Make His Job Too Easy It Doesn't Take Much To Distract Us And Fill Our Mind With Things That Are So Vain And Trivial You Guys Know I'm Not Going To Just Do Like Hey No Social Media Thing But I Want You To Really Think About The Question Is The Meditation And What Is Filling Your Mind Holy That God Would Be Pleased Or Is It Filled With This Galatians Five Says This Is The Stuff That's Evident In The World And Your Flesh It's Easy Now The Deeds Of The Flesh Are Super Evident Which Are Immorality Impurity Sensuality Lust Satan Knows That's Such An Easy Trigger Idolatry Sorcery Amnity Strife Jealousy Outbursts Of Anger Disputes Dissensions And Factions That's All There Envying Drunkenness Carousing And Things Like These Which I Forewarned You Just As I Have Forewarned You That Those Who Practice Such Things Will Not Inherent The Kingdom Of God All Of Those Things Are Almost Like The Schedule Agenda Of Social Media That's Everywhere And It's Attacking Our Kids It's Attacking You But The Reason Why I Bring This Up Is Because I Found As I Meditated For My Own Life This Strange Habit Of Mine Which Is Yes Maybe I Could Think That Like Because I'm A Busy Man I Don't I'm Not On Facebook That Much I Don't Know What's Going On The World And All That Stuff But I Found In Myself This Habit That Because After A Long Day I Need To Decompress I Will Allow My Mind To Just Soak In This Stuff Meaning Rather Than Earlier When I Said I Need To Hate The Things That God Detests I Almost Saw It As A Necessary Therapy For Myself Is That The Same For You You Go Work Hard Study Hard And You Come Home And You Like I Need This You Don't Need That It's Dangerous You Allow Your Mind To Get Accustomed To Things That Are So Trivial So Distracting And We Somehow Convince Ourself That's Our Rest That Was Refreshing Now I'm Not Saying Oh Therefore At The End Of The Work You Have To Go And Pray An I Want To Challenge Us We Have To Guard This There's A Book That I'm Reading Now Where We're Letting The World Have A Seat At My Table And In The Evening Time I'm Constantly Inviting The World To Dine With Me Why Am I Doing That Don't Do That You Don't Need That But Rather Our Hearts Are Seeking For God's Blessing Our Hearts Are Seeking For God's Reaffirmation His Encouragement His Strength His Power If You Don't Want To Sit And Just Read Another Hour Just Simply Talk About Things With Your Spouse Talk About Things With Your Roommates Let The Content Of Your Mouth Be That Which You're Reflecting On What The Lord Is Teaching You What What Happened In The Day Where God Filled God's Presence It's All About The Consideration Of Our Lord Amen For When We Do This King David Says We'll Be Blessed And I Will Be Acquitted King David Says We'll Be Blessed Then I'll Be Spared From Great Transgression This Is A Man Who Knows You Know More And More Recently We Hear News Of Like Mega Church Pasture Fall Into Adultery Or There Is A Falling Of This And And Sometimes You Wonder Like How Does That Even Happen He's The Leader Of The Worship Service He's Preaching And He's Praying And He's Doing All This Stuff He's Literally Saturated In The Word Well That's Supposed To Constantly Expose Everything And There's A Journey There's A Journey Where First There's An Exposure Of The Light And Then You Realize Oh My Gosh I'm Dirty And Then You Go To God Repenting And Saying Equip Me Clean Me Is There Hurtful Ways Erroneous Ways Unintentional Things Oh Oh My Gosh Am I So Rebellious I'm High Handed Just Like Rebelling Against You Forgive Me And In So Doing What Is He Doing He's Clearing His Conscience You Know What A Blessing It Is To Have A Clean Conscience Before The Lord Because You've Addressed It In Christ There's Nothing That Feels So Freeing Can You Imagine You Being A Servant Of The Most Holy God And Your Whole Life Is Like I Want To Hear From God Well Done Good And Faithful Servant But You Know It's Like Dude I Totally Didn't Do What He Told Me To Do And You Just Sit There Like I Hope He Doesn't Ask I Hope He Doesn't Ask That's Torture I Hope He Doesn't See I Hope He Doesn't See That's The Plight Of An Individual Who's Not Willing To Subject His Heart And Lay It On The Table Like King David Does So I Want To Give You A Challenge Have You Had Moments Recently Where You Just Lay Your Heart Down On The Table And If You Couldn't Dissect It Yourself Like What Are The Errors And What Are The Hidden Faults Have You Asked Someone Spiritual To Help You Such Humility Such Longing For Purity I Was Like Can You Help Me At This Box Full Of Junk I So Frustrated Out Of My Mind Do It Seek That Counsel And Then Know That Journey Is Going To End In Blessing Assurance Purity And A Kind Of Relationship With God Where We Have Not A Fearful Like Gosh What's The Lord Going Expect Of Me Now But Freedom Let The Words Of My Mouth And The Meditation Of Our Hearts Be Acceptable In The Sight Of God Let's Pray Lord Heavenly Father Thank you For This Challenge You've Given To Us Through Your Servant David Lord We See His Words Of Anguish Over Sin And God We Just Want To Confess And Repent Sometimes We Don't Even Feel That But God When We Do I Pray We Would Have Such Humility Help Us To Never Give Ourselves Excuses Help Us Never To Defend Our Own But Lord Help Us To Bear Before You So That You Would Heal It You Would Keep It You Would Restore It I I Pray Father God You Would Refresh Us And Renew Us Every Day This World Is Filled With Filth And As We Walk Lord God We Recognize How Dirty We Can Be So We Pray Wash Us Anew Minister To Us It's In Christ's Name Amen Let us All Rise For Our Peace Peace Amen Peace The words of my mouth And the meditations of my heart Be easy to you Easy to you In the words of my mouth And the meditations of my heart Be easy to you My love You're my love You're my love You're my redeemer You're the ways that I've seen I deserve to be a blessing In your heart Every hour and every morning Lord, I long to be a servant I desire to be a blessing In your eyes In your eyes In your words In the words of my mouth In the meditations of my heart Be easy to you Be easy to you May the words of my mouth In the meditations of my heart Be easy to you Be easy to you My God You're my love and my redeemer You're the reason that I see I desire to be a blessing in your world Every hour of death and morning Lord, I want to be the servant I desire to be a blessing in your world You're my love and my redeemer You're the reason that I see I desire to be a blessing in your world Every hour of death and morning Lord, I want to be the servant I desire to be a blessing in your world In your hearts Amen I'll read from Hebrews chapter 13 verse 20 Now the God of peace Who brought up from the dead The great shepherd of the sheep Through the blood of the eternal covenant Even Jesus our Lord Equip you in every good thing to do his will Working in us that which is pleasing in his sight Through Jesus Christ to whom Be the glory forever and ever Amen God sent to the son They called in Jesus Jesus, he came to you.</p><p>He left the hole. He opened and died to buy the door. An empty grave is there too, but saved over there. Because he lives, I can face to love. Because he lives, all fear is gone. Because I know he won't die in shame. And life is worth the living just because he lives.</p><p>And everyone was made so we could see, so we could see. You are the glorious Christ, the greatest of all the lies. Your power is unequal. Your love beyond all heights. No greater sacrifice. When you lay down your life. We join the song of angels who praise you day and night.</p></div></body></html>
