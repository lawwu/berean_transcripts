So go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=135s">00:02:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead and uh, so each one of those, if you got the Greek words, if you got the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=139s">00:02:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">English words you don't get a point.

Tracts are helpful, I'm not saying it's wrong or bad. Actually, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=357s">00:05:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">probably beneficial, but for you to be as comfortable with the gospel and to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=363s">00:06:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">able to take it from different angles, like you could spin it around and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=367s">00:06:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like a globe, where you spin it around, put your finger somewhere and you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=370s">00:06:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly where you are, and you know how to lead people into this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=374s">00:06:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation.

Probably the place to begin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2057s">00:34:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes when I'm looking at someone, this is the thought I have, and just running through my brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2066s">00:34:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know that God is, you know that God is God the creator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2072s">00:34:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, and talk to them like they, like they know. If you're constantly trying to convince them that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2080s">00:34:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">God exists, you know, it just goes down a rabbit trail. And when you just, when you anchor this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2086s">00:34:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">down, you'll hear them say something, some certain things, and you'll hear it in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2091s">00:34:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">comments that they're using. Like what you just said just proves that you believe in a God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2099s">00:34:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes out so much. But if you don't have that anchoring thought in, you're going to spend a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2105s">00:35:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of time trying to convince it, and you're going to miss the idea and the thought that like, man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2110s">00:35:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what he just said proved it, but he got away with that statement. And you're still trying to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2116s">00:35:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">him believe that there's a God. Yes? Is it still like an appropriate starting point when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2121s">00:35:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about like a staunch atheist? Yeah, I mean, with an atheist, it's, it's pretty easy. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2128s">00:35:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we've all used this, I'm guessing the same strategy. Where does anything come from, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2134s">00:35:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like the first line. And they're going to go and go and go. But at a certain point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2140s">00:35:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to say, I don't know. They have to. That's the end for the atheist. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2145s">00:35:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a, it's a higher philosophy, or like, it's a, it's a more sophisticated philosophy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2151s">00:35:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for them, right? Like I'm more sophisticated because I'm able to say, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2157s">00:35:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Which is faith. And so I still think it's a starting point. I say like, I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2165s">00:36:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something too. Like I have faith too. And I believe that God created everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2171s">00:36:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say that to an atheist. I believe that God created everything. And pull him into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2177s">00:36:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">biblical worldview rather than play in his playground. Because he knows. So don't play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2188s">00:36:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">their game. Don't go into their world and, and be like, well, I'm going to try to convince you of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2194s">00:36:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact like what you just said, like you don't know, proves that, like, first of all, at the very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2201s">00:36:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">least that there is place or space that perhaps God exists, right? And they're going to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2209s">00:36:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I guess, you know, like, and so you go from there and you get to the point where you say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2215s">00:36:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">well, God created all things. So I would say that next, even if they're not fully here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2219s">00:36:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them taking that step into the biblical worldview, maybe he does as an atheist for him to say that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2226s">00:37:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, well, God is the creator. He exists. Everything we see around us has been created by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2232s">00:37:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">God, you know, and we do that unapologetically. We say it with a smile on our face and we say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2237s">00:37:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it very nicely. But we say, basically, what we're saying is you're wrong. Not because we have all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2244s">00:37:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the truth, like, like perfectly like wrapped up and stuff like that. But by the confidence that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2250s">00:37:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we have in our word. So, okay, I keep moving here. So you know that God is, God the creator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2259s">00:37:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but you also have the moral law that God is the Holy One. That's your conscience. You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2266s">00:37:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that there is right and wrong. What is guilt? You have these things that points to some kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2274s">00:37:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of creator that is actually, at the very least, good or better or the word we use is holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2282s">00:38:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Launching the conversation, start with a common conversation. So don't like go and like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2291s">00:38:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like say, hey, so what kind of background do you come from? And they're like talking about the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2295s">00:38:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're Buddhist. And then you just go like, well, God is creator and he's holy, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2300s">00:38:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't do that. But like, start with common conversation. What you're trying to do again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2305s">00:38:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like this isn't, this isn't like a step by step thing that we're going through. We're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2310s">00:38:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tack these things down in your heart, in your in your mind, so that you can at any point when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2316s">00:38:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're spinning it around in a conversation, these things are you're so intimately aware with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2321s">00:38:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel. We understand that, right? The four points are the gospel. We're so intimately aware with it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2326s">00:38:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that when he says something like something pops up, and that becomes the grabbing point, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2331s">00:38:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, he like this is where I can say that God is creator. This is where I can bring up the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2335s">00:38:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that God is holy. But start with a common conversation. Listen very carefully, please,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2341s">00:39:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">please, please do not, we're going to go out hopefully together. But as we go and do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2349s">00:39:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">do not be formulating just your own answer. Actually hear what they're saying. Try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2356s">00:39:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like try to step into their shoes. And why are they saying what they're saying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2360s">00:39:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are they thinking the way they're thinking? Why did he get defensive when I said this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2365s">00:39:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you're, you're trying to understand the person. So listen carefully and wait patiently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2370s">00:39:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for the answers. Our goal is not to, you know, be like in your face kind of thing. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2376s">00:39:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our goal is not to beat them in some kind of debate. Our goal is to care, to love, and ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2383s">00:39:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to restore God's glory in this person's life because God's glory is that important to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2389s">00:39:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we patiently a lot of times I think we are after our own glory, because this is what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2395s">00:39:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believe. And so our egos are involved in it. And so as we're talking with people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2398s">00:39:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not talking on behalf of God anymore. We're talking on behalf of our Christianity. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2405s">00:40:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very bad. You know, it's you lose the love and you lost it. So ask good questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2413s">00:40:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't have to be preaching at them. We're trying to circulate something here. So ask lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2425s">00:40:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of good questions. I gave you just some in this packet or in this section. The useful questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2432s">00:40:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in both the God is Creator and God is Holy sections. So those are some starting points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2436s">00:40:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can tell that those are just one out of thousands of questions that you can ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2440s">00:40:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">based on these things. Ask permission to ask direct questions. This has been super helpful for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2446s">00:40:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This was another one of those surprising things. Where are we here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2458s">00:40:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, actually, let's backtrack. So sometimes you have to ask yes or no questions. Have you ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2464s">00:41:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">wondered why we're here? Is this the way the world should be? Do you think that God is involved in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2469s">00:41:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">our world today? So what the yes or no questions do is it makes them, you and them, you affirm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2477s">00:41:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">them that we are on some kind of common ground here. Okay, so for example, do you think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2483s">00:41:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is involved in our world today? If they say yes, there are going to be statements that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2488s">00:41:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">make after that will disprove what they said. So you say, but you said yes, we agree to the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2494s">00:41:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that God is indeed involved or something like that. So yes or no questions do have its place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2500s">00:41:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">However, open-ended questions are better. The how, what, why, you can ask, oh, can you explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2508s">00:41:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that a little bit further? Those are good. Make them talk and make sure that they're not talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2517s">00:41:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like nonsensically. So if you don't get it, don't just assume that, assume it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2526s">00:42:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, because they're a Hindu guy or whatever. So here's some of those questions that can help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2532s">00:42:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you make that decision? What motivated you to choose this job? Why is that so important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2538s">00:42:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to you? Who determines if something is right or wrong? What do you think God requires of us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2542s">00:42:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">go to heaven? How does someone in your religion get to heaven? Have them explain. You're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2546s">00:42:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to get them to explain their worldview so that you can understand them better. All right, now we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2550s">00:42:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask permission to ask direct questions. We have here, can I ask you a personal question, Mike?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2555s">00:42:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you deal with guilt or shame? How do I know if God approves of me or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2560s">00:42:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So when they're difficult questions, when you feel like, oh, they're getting defensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2565s">00:42:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they look uncomfortable, you could ask them for permission and it really helps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2570s">00:42:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because it makes it feel like they're kind of in control again. They're not like backing up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2577s">00:42:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're like, I gave this guy permission.

So ask permission to ask direct questions. Can I ask you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2588s">00:43:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a difficult question? I'm not trying to be offensive, but do you mind if I ask it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2595s">00:43:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think you're a sinner? So if you just said, if you said like, hey, do you think you're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2602s">00:43:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sinner? They might be like, what? But the responses you'll get will be very defensive in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2608s">00:43:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you ask them, they're going to be like, oh yeah, you know, I think, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2611s">00:43:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it gets a little more cordial.

It's helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2616s">00:43:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Letter E, listen again and then apply the Christian worldview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2623s">00:43:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So you're, you're starting with a common conversation. You're listening and waiting for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2627s">00:43:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">answers. You're clarifying things. You're asking good questions. You're asking permission to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2632s">00:43:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">ask questions. You're listening again. And as you're doing all this, you're, what you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2638s">00:43:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">gathering is their worldview. And then what you're doing is you pull them into the Christian worldview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2643s">00:44:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So just the last thought, we sometimes think like if it's me and Marsha,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2652s">00:44:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we sometimes think that they're there, I'm here and here's the truth. Okay. And so we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2658s">00:44:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to get to the truth, but what, how it really is, the actual picture is she's there.

So that, keep that, keep that there. Like the anchoring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2671s">00:44:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is on God and who he is.

All the other stuff, like it'll start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2678s">00:44:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fall in place the next few weeks as we go into man, as we go into Jesus, as we go into what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2684s">00:44:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">conversion, how, how do, how are they called to respond and apprehend the first three points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2688s">00:44:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for it to become a saving gospel to them? Okay. Any final questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2693s">00:44:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

Is it that one? Okay. So handling objections. So this is a resource,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2724s">00:45:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">read through it.

And then in April, there's a gospel night. Okay. So I'm going to be asking you to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2852s">00:47:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, like listen, listen for the announcements today during Sunday service and, uh, be engaged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2856s">00:47:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with that because as a class, unless you have prior engagements, totally fine. You didn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2860s">00:47:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">before we had the class, so that's okay. Um, but if you have that slot free, um, try to think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2866s">00:47:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it as mandatory. Um, yeah, that way, uh, we'll go and we'll share the gospel together. And, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2874s">00:47:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's two, I think very good ways to do it. It's the cold evangelism. And then it's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2878s">00:47:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bring a friend to church type of evangelism. And then the middle two weeks, we're going to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2883s">00:48:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">um, I'm actually going to be asking you guys to write down the name of somebody that you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2888s">00:48:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you regularly are maybe interacting with, um, and to actually share the gospel with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2893s">00:48:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So that one is a little scarier, I think, than cold evangelism because there's some skin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2897s">00:48:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in the game there.

Let's pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2903s">00:48:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Heavenly Father, we pray for your help to evangelize a gospel that truly is centered around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2912s">00:48:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you, uh, that we might not waver as people who believe in a high view of God and a high view of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2919s">00:48:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your word, uh, that we might not waver in, uh, deadening and diluting and, and making, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2925s">00:48:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">boiling things down to, to, uh, something so simplistic that it is no longer the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2931s">00:48:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Father, we know that the enemy loves it when we preach an incomplete gospel.

And so God, I pray that this would be truly our anchoring thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/392870035#t=2943s">00:49:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You are a holy God.
