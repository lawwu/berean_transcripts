And so that no matter what circumstances we go through in our lives or whatever trials we have, that even though we don't know why or what's gonna happen, we know that God is holding everything and sustaining everything together. So I think that has been something I'm thankful for this year. - I'm thankful to be back at Berean and my church community and friends and I'm thankful for my new job and my amazing trainer, Abby. - I'm thankful for our Bible study, a whole group that we started a few months back. It's been really good. - Thank you. - Really encouraging, spending time with other families and singles and studying the word together, it's been good. - Ta-da. (laughing) - Among the many things I would be thankful for, I'm most especially thankful for Berean Community Church. And just over these last 14, 15 years, I've been able to find a community and a group where I grew and I was really challenged by my faith. And just over the years I realized and I appreciate more like the little things that I've seen and gone through at this church and I'm especially grateful for our leaders, Elder Phillip, Elder Joe and Pastor Peter. I think with time now I realize just how much they really put in and the sacrifice they gave to us in the church. - So I think this season I realized how thankful I am, not only for my family, for my husband and my son and my family, but I think for the first time I've experienced what it's like to actually have a church family. And being so, being a new mom and being a wife and all, I think I've drawn so much encouragement from a lot of the moms who are here because not only do they share about how amazing it is to have children, they're very honest about some of the hard things that you have to go through. And I think for me as a young mom, it helped prep me for knowing what to see and what's coming ahead when it comes to raising my son. So that's something that I'm extremely, I love Berean, I tell all my friends to come even though there are really good churches. I say, "Well, if you ever wanna come, "just come check out Berean." And some of them have, so, just like the one behind the camera. But I'm very thankful this season for this church 'cause I've been very blessed by so many people. - I'm thankful for God and how he's been working through my life, through his word, and how it continues to ground me in the midst of all the craziness of life and work and Jen and anything else. - I'm thankful for this church, the community, and our small group. And just so many people involved in our life. Thankful for our marriage. And just the gospel of Jesus. I think that's good. - One thing I've been thankful for specifically this year, in addition to many other things, is our college ministry and just seeing their, just love for the Lord and their desire to grow and to serve our church and to really be committed and just really learn what the Bible says. So, I'm really thankful for them this year. - I'm thankful for small group and just the ability to have sisters in community that are able to encourage me and point me toward Christ. - I'm thankful for football and the opportunity to just meet with other women in the church and fellowship with them through the sport of the game. - I am thankful for, there are a lot of things I'm really thankful for, but I would say just this past year, something that's just been something I really appreciated has just been the church. I think just this past year, just being a part of the church and just meeting all the brothers and sisters here and just really getting to know everybody has been such a blessing for me. And yeah, I would say that's probably something that has really changed my life and I appreciate the most. - I'm very thankful that God brought me to US and lead me to a deeper knowledge and experience of his love and faithfulness. And I'm thankful that God is God in a time of chaos, weakness and confusion. And I'm very thankful for the brothers and sisters in Berlin that your hospitality means a lot to me as a surgeon. Yes. - I just want to say I'm thankful for Berlin. - I'm thankful for my mom. - Stop it.</p></div></body></html>
