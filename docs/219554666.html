watching from a distance and say, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/219554666#t=174s">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these guys are not

church that Christ, even though we can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/219554666#t=190s">00:03:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">physically see him, if we

he's able to say over and over again, "I know your deeds, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/219554666#t=200s">00:03:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I

reputation, this is how everybody else sees you, but this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/219554666#t=208s">00:03:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is who

and thinking that there would be fruit and there's no fruit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/219554666#t=225s">00:03:45.240</a></span> | <span
