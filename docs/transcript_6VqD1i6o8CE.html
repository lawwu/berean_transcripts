Hi. You making an announcement? I'm going to make an announcement. Sure.                         Good evening, everyone. We're going to go ahead and get started with Bible study. So if you haven't yet, please go ahead and find your seats. I'll go ahead and pray for us. Let's pray together. Father, we thank you for your goodness. Thank you for your provision, for giving us this time to study your word. We thank you so much for your word and that you've given it to us as a way for us to learn more about you and to grow in our faith and in our knowledge. We thank you for your love and your blessings towards us, knowing that these are eternal and what this world has to offer is temporary. We pray, Lord, that we wouldn't get so caught up in the things of this world and the distractions, but we would set our minds and our gaze towards the things above and towards you. So would you give us just this desire and this love to you, Lord? We pray for tonight that you'd be honored. We pray for this time of praise that you would be praised. So again, we thank you so much. We love you. We pray all this in your name. Amen. Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?  Before the throne. Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect plea. A great high priest whose name is love, whoever lives and pleads for me. My name is graven on his hands. My name is written on his heart. I know that while in heaven he stands, no tongue can bid me thance depart. No tongue can bid me thance depart. When Satan tempts. When Satan tempts me to despair and tells me of the guilt within, upward I look and see him there, who made an end to all my sin. Because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free. For God the just is satisfied to look on him and pardon me. To look on him and pardon me.  Behold him there, the risen lamb, my perfect spotless righteousness, the great unchangeable I am. The king of glory and of grace, one with himself I cannot die. My soul is purchased by his blood. My life is hid with Christ on high, with Christ my Savior and my God. With Christ my Savior and my God. One with himself I cannot die. My soul is purchased by his blood. My life is hid with Christ on high, with Christ my Savior and my God. With Christ my Savior and my God.   Jesus, Jesus. Holy and anointed one. Jesus, Jesus. Jesus, risen and exalted one. Jesus, your name is like honey on my lips, your spirit like water to my soul. Your word is a lamp unto my feet. Jesus, I love you. I love you. Jesus, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus. Holy and anointed one. Jesus, Jesus. Jesus, risen and exalted one. Jesus, your name is like honey on my lips, your spirit like water to my soul. Your word is a lamp unto my feet. Jesus, I love you. I love you. Your name is like honey on my lips, your spirit like water to my soul. Your word is a lamp unto my feet. Jesus, I love you. I love you. Jesus, I love you. I love you. You may be seated. All right. Good evening, everyone. As you get settled in, I just want to make a quick announcement. First of all, thank you so much. As you guys volunteer for parking, you're helping just coordinate the foot traffic and volunteering for the child care. Again, for the entirety of the session, there's 17 weeks, and so it's really helpful to have everybody contribute to that, just sharing in the load and the responsibility. But one question people had was, we're sending out emails for volunteering for cleaning on Sunday. So just as a brief recap, the way that we decided to do it was using a system through our small groups where we're allocating three small groups and a home group for a month. Please consider that not just simply as a sign-up request, but what we're doing is actually seeing that more so as an assignment for your group. And so if at all possible, please make sure to look at the link and sign up to serve. And that's primarily because we had so many of you guys help out with Sunday cleaning, but now as the facilities get bigger and the use gets expanded, it's quite a big bear. And each week, there's 20 volunteers that help out in the cleaning efforts. And then what would happen is actually over time, we saw the same people just signing up month after month. And so conscientiously, the leadership decided this is a responsibility where we're all using the facilities, and it's how widespread it is, it's more helpful to have people who see the need, people who are using the facility just help out in cleaning it up. And so we made the conscientious decision to make sure that the responsibility is spread out through all of us. And as many hands make the work light, we want to make sure we're all involved in it, okay? However, we know that some of you guys are already really involved on Sunday where you have to come early for something else and stick around later for something else. In those cases, obviously, there's exceptions. If you have any questions at all about volunteering for those things, please shoot me an email. But again, when it comes to your month and you see that email come out and say, "Hey, please volunteer," please go ahead and see that as an opportunity just to come together as a small group and serve and put your name down for that opportunity, okay? Thanks, everyone. All right. We're going to... Let me read for us tonight's passage, and then I'll pray. And then I'll go over... Actually, I'll go over the questions, and then we'll pray together. So here's 1 Peter 1 verses 20 to 25. For he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God. Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart. For you've been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable. That is through the living and enduring word of God. For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever. And then this is a word which was preached to you." So this is the end of chapter 1, and there are a lot of descriptions of what God has done in chapter 1. And so tonight we're going to be going over these six verses. Question 1 and 2, you guys know the drill. You just go over the observation. But question number 3 is pretty important for this study. So let me read it for you. "What is the relationship between a Christian's life of love and his or her understanding of the word of God? And can a Christian live in bitterness and unforgiveness? Is that a possibility?" Okay, so I want you guys to discuss this, and then at 8.20 we'll get back together for the teaching portion. But let me pray for us, and then we'll get our small group time started. Lord, we are very thankful for the 19 verses that we've already been able to cover together with our brothers and sisters in Christ. And as we wrap up chapter 1, help us to really trust that Your Word is timeless and that it does not change, and it is all-powerful. I pray that You would give us eyes to see things and ears to hear things that You've intended us to understand. And I pray, Lord, that we will not be so eager to show off what we know, but rather to glean from the text so that we can better apply in our lives. Lord, we come here with different burdens, different requests, different needs, but we do pray that Your Word really would refresh and rejuvenate us tonight and give us just really a fruitful time of studying together. And Lord, that we would leave here longing to apply the things that we've learned. In Jesus' name we pray. So I'll see you guys at 8.20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      All right, if I can ask you guys to just turn your attentions to the screens. Let me pray for us, and then we'll jump into this meaty passage. Father, help us not to be just stubborn and nearsighted, where we only see this as an academic endeavor to get our theology straight. But help us, Lord, really to seek to know your heart, not just for us, but for those who've wronged us, for those who need you desperately, that you would move us to love. And I pray that you would teach us, that you would speak to us. And we know that love is not something that, no matter how hard we try, that we can do well. So this has to be something that you compel us toward. So we pray for your help as we look in your text. And Jesus, let me pray. So this is a quick review. If you remember verses 10 to 12, it was like a theologically rich section where it said this is like a giant salvation baton pass from the beginning of time. And then the three imperatives that we looked at in the previous section were in light of the fact that this whole human history, the gospel message was kind of the central point. This is how we're supposed to live. We're supposed to fix our hope completely, be holy in our behavior, and conduct ourselves in fear. And that was the last two weeks. Today-- it got cut off. So this is today's passage, starting for he was foreknown. And what I did with this is the red, it's like importing grammatical words. But in the process of doing this, I discovered that there is no for in the original language. The NASB added that. You guys see that? So I just crossed that out. So I crossed that out. And then my eyes will go to the so that, my eyes will go to the since, and the for. So I highlighted those in red. And then I noticed some like eternality theme in here. From the beginning of time, enduring, forever. Hebrews 13.8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The eternality theme, I just highlighted all of those in yellow. So the top, where it's cut off, it says before the foundation of the world, imperishable, enduring, endures forever. So it's like a permanent fixture. So I did that. So it was like, OK, I know where my eyes can go. And then the blue bolded was all the stuff that God does. And I put it all on the kind of the side to make it easier. So there's a foreknowing, there's an appearing, there's a raising, there's a glorifying, and then there's a birthing again, and then a preaching. Do you guys see how I kind of put that there? And I bolded it so that I see that there's at least six things that God does here. And there's only one thing I'm commanded to do. And that's right in the middle. Fervently love. And the reason I do this is not to make it more appealing to you artsy folk. But the reason I do this is so that I can kind of track like what's commonly or what's emphasized here, what's the main point. And the main point I see is that there's an expected response. And the main thing is fervently love. And I noticed I look through the whole thing in the Greek. That's I think the only command in this section. There are all these things that were done. And the only command that there is for me is fervently love. And it's interesting that's in the passive. Usually a passive means it's a response. It's not something I am conjuring up. So I first do that. And I'm at the end of the chapter. But it seemed like the last five weeks there was so much of God doing stuff. So I just made a list. Okay. So this is all from just chapter one, things that mention the power of God and the will of God. And if you notice the purple, I'm not comfortable with it emotionally. But there's almost a foreknowing aspect of God. There's almost a predicting and ordaining. The emotional part that I'm not comfortable with is then am I a robot, right? Does he just force me to do stuff? Does he twist my arm? Because emotionally that's what it feels like. But I notice in the scripture it's very -- it seems like God is in control of everything. Do you notice that? And we don't like God being in control of everything at times, right? It makes us feel like helpless. Okay. And then I noticed that there's a holifying, a sanctifying, like a changing. And I just did those in red. Okay. He sanctifies. He causes a rebirth. He redeems, causes a rebirth again. And then Jesus being raised from the dead, I noticed, oh, it's mentioned twice. Is that significant to my salvation? So I just listed all the stuff that God does. And there's only like four imperatives in here, right? There's all of this stuff that God does. And what am I supposed to do with all of this? So it's helpful at the end of every chapter just to do a little recap. Because verse 23 said, "You have been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living, enduring word of God." Right? And your faith and your hope are in who? In God. So this is the God we serve. He does it all. And my faith is in Him. Not in me. Not in Pastor Peter. Okay? My hope is not in Berean Community Church or a Christian government. No. It's in Him. And my hope is also in Him. And He does all this stuff. Okay? So I noticed that with my eyes. Verse 22. So when I was trying to memorize chapter one, this was like October, November. Verse 22 was so odd for me. Because it was all this theology, and then there's just this, first of all, the wording is strange. You guys notice? Since you have an obedience to the truth, right? Purify your souls for a love without hypocrisy. They go, "What?" Right? Fervently love one another from the heart. So I just got tripped over this verse. And I realized, rightly so, there's a lot of conditional clauses in verse 22. Okay? So the translations are like grammatically funky. All of them. A little bit. Okay? The purification. So the perfect tense of the participle signifies a past action that has ongoing consequences. So you were purified. And so things are going to happen because you were purified. All right? That's the thrust of the tense of the participle. And if I'm paraphrasing this verse, the result of my conversion is that I have love for my fellow Christian. That's a byproduct. You guys following that? I cannot say I've been purified and not love the fellow Christian. Okay? So there's a purification that's done something to me in the past that has ramifications to the now. My result is I'm a loving person. And the command is to use this new love that's in me and go all out. You guys get that? And so one of the questions I came up with is, what's the difference between love and fervent love? It's not used that often, right? We fervently love because he fervently loved us. That's not what 1 John 4:19 says. Right? Beloved, let us fervently love one another. That's not what it says either. Okay? It just says love. But why does it say fervently twice in 1 Peter? It comes up again in chapter 4. So I looked at the word in the Greek for this is ektinos. So that's actually a physiological term. It means to stretch to the furthest limit of a muscle's capacity. Go all out. I'm not flexible. I am like, I don't have dexterity in my body. You tell me to do the splits, I'm doing them right now. Okay? But I know that I can train that. So with my limited capacity right now, I'm gonna try to strain to love. And that fervent love one day will continue to grow as I am being stretched. That's the imagery. You guys get that? And it comes out again in 1 Peter 4.8. Because when a lot of, let's say there's chaos, the government forces a mandate or forces like a vaccine, let's say. Half the people think it's good. Half the people think it's bad. And they start arguing. Blame shifts start to happen. Right? People start to get divided. Not because they don't love each other, but because something external happened to cause some chaos and division. So when things go awry, human beings have a tendency to hate on each other and to riot. I'm not talking just like what we understand as riot, but just things just go crazy. Fervently love in that situation. This is the exhortation. Okay? So here's a question that I want to ask. Do we love people even if they don't deserve it? Nod your heads yes or no, or shake your heads. If they don't deserve it, should we love them? Okay, I don't see any way. So you're either doing this or you're like, okay. How about if they've wronged you? Badly. Do you love them? What if they've caused you irreparable harm? Do you love them? It takes all my energy just not to hate them or to be angry with them. Okay? So this is an important question here. Can a Christian live in unforgiveness and bitterness? So I'm going to do a quick look through how the love of God changes us and how that affects our love going outward, right? So here's a fruit of the flesh. There's enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions. And here's a strong verse, okay? Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. So let me clarify one thing. If you have a fit of anger, that doesn't mean God's going to send you to hell, okay? The only sin that is deserving of hell -- okay, let me get this. The only sin that you will not be forgiven of is a rejection of Christ. You guys follow that? You guys understand that? So if you wrestle with anger, that doesn't mean you're going to immediately, like, not inherit the kingdom of God. But what this is talking about is a man unchanged by God looks like that. But a man changed by God for the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, piety, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, right? But what's the first one that comes out? Is love. So if you were to grab me, okay, and to throw me into an ocean, I'm going to ask you to do a couple things. I'm going to ask you to first let me remove my phone, my wallet, and my keys. And if I'm wearing something nice, maybe I'll ask you to do that. Okay, my shoes, too. Why? Justin, you need to pick me up. Jeremy Wong, he grabbed me and picked me up. Some of you guys who are buff were like, "How come he's not naming me?" I'm just, okay. But let's say our church guys decide to grab me, okay? Throw me into the ocean. Can I get into the ocean and come out be dry? Yes or no? Impossible. If a tsunami is coming at me, I'm not only going to get wet, I might die. It is impossible for me to be hit by a tsunami and come out not wet. You guys following this? All of the stuff in chapter 1 that God has done is a very powerful force. He, from the beginning of time, is unchanging. He, from the very beginning of time, has orchestrated, ordained everything. He protects your salvation. He causes rebirth. He saves. He raises people from the dead. So for you to say, "I've gotten immersed into this God," and to come out dry is impossible. So I'm going to say something that might discomfort you a little bit. It is impossible for a Christian to live in unforgiveness and bitterness. Does this make sense? It is impossible for a Christian to live harboring a forever grudge, bitterness, and unforgiveness. Najaz, if you understand this, I guarantee you, you will not be able to argue that biblically against that. You guys follow that? I'm going to repeat it one more time. If you are a Christian, you cannot, it's impossible for you not to forgive, not to live in bitterness, and say, "I will never forgive you." You guys understand this? Because God has changed you. It's less, it's more possible that you go into an ocean and come out dry than for you to be a Christian and not be able to forgive. I don't care what's been done. Now, if you wrestle with the emotions and the ups and downs, that's normal. That's sanctification. That's part of the sanctification. But you cannot be a Christian and go to the grave with grudges. God will not let that happen. You guys understand that? 1 John 4, 7, and 8. "Beloved, let us love one another, "for love is from God, and everyone who loves "is born a God and knows God. "The one who does not love does not know God, "for God is love." Ooh, that's strong words. I don't like 1 John, because 1 John makes everything way black, way white. Right? Okay? You are a liar. I'm a liar. It cuts you. But that's what it says. 1 John 4, 19 and 21. We love. Not we should love. We love. Because why? This ocean of love has drenched us. Okay? If someone says, "I love God," usually they say it like that. No one says, "I love God," right? It's like, "Oh, I love God," and hates his brother. You liar. "For the one who does not love his brother "whom he has seen cannot love God "whom he has not seen." Impossible is another word to say that. And this is the command we have from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. So, we are commanded to love. We are enabled to love. Make sense? We will wrestle with emotion. And scars, even when they heal, are tender. True or false? Yeah. But God empowers you to love. Because what's the first fruit of the Spirit? Love. It's like, "Goal!" The next day, I'm like, "Lord, "that guy, he did this and this and that to me, but... "Oh, you want me to love him? "Ah, okay." A true Christian is always willing to make the effort. Okay? So, when I hear this verse, I think of like, "Okay, what does it mean then?" Romans 12, 18, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, "be at peace with all men." If you've had a falling out with somebody, as a Christian, you will want to pursue him or her in due time. You guys get that? Ephesians 2, 8-10, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, "and that not of yourself, but as a gift of God, "not as a result of works, so that no one may boast." And that's a verse that everyone memorizes as a kid. We are his workmanship, and we have a mighty potter who changes hearts, right? Created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we would walk in them. Here's the eternality theme again. We pursue, because that's just a byproduct of knowing God, in due time. Here's a passage that I want to read for you. It's lengthy, so I just kind of cut it up. This is the parable of the unforgiving servant. "Then Peter came and said to him, "'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me?' "And I forgive him up to seven times. "Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you up to seven times, "'but up to seventy times seven. "'For this reason, the kingdom of heaven "'may be compared to a king "'who wishes to settle accounts with his slaves.'" So this is not a perfect, detailed story, but it's a parable to explain a heart of something. So there's a slave who had an unpayable debt, and then the master forgives him, right? Okay, so verse 27, "And the lord of that slave felt compassion "and released him and forgave him the debt. "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves "who owed him a hundred denarii. "He seized and began to chuck him, saying, "'Pay back what you owe!' "So his fellow slave fell to the ground "and began to plead with him, saying, "'Have patience with me, and I will repay you.'" It's the same thing that guy said. Okay, verse 33, "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave "in the same way that I had mercy on you? "And his lord moved with anger, "handed him over to the torturers "until he should repay all that was owed him. "My heavenly father will also do the same to you "if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart." This isn't talking about, well, if you, in the event you are a Christian, but you can't forgive this person, you will go to hell. That's not what this is saying. This is saying it, if you really understand what you were forgiven from, you cannot but forgive. So, in other words, a Christian cannot have a victim mentality. Not just if you understand this. A Christian cannot have a victim mentality. And there are people who have victim mentalities in the churches. It's always someone else's fault, right? A Christian cannot have a victim mentality. A Christian cannot live in unforgiveness. All right, that's what the text is saying. (pages rustling) Oop. And I wanna just have us wrestle with this. We're studying this theology in 1 Peter and all of this stuff that God's done. We've been born again, we've been purified, so that we've been obedient to the truth. We are protected by the power of God through faith for our salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. We rejoice greatly, even though we suffer for a little while. But the point of this is fervently love. And that's that heartbeat of the passage that we read today. And I wanna just read, Matthew 24 came to my mind, and I wanna just read this for you. This is describing the end of times. "You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. "See that you are not frightened, "for those things must take place, "but that is not yet the end. "For nation will rise against nation, "and kingdom against kingdom, "and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes "and maybe hail," like yesterday, okay? "But all these things are merely "the beginning of birth pains. "Then they will deliver you to tribulation and will kill you "and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. "At that time, many will fall away and betray one another "and hate one another. "Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many." And I think one of the false prophets that's around is, like, I gotta be careful here. I really don't like the thing called deconstruction. I really don't like it. 'Cause you know what's gonna happen when you deconstruct? You discover you're a sinner. And that everyone else around you is a sinner. And everyone else around you is a lot worse than you had ever imagined him to be. And you're a lot worse than you've ever imagined yourself to be. And to say that, God loves you anyway, and you just reject his standard of holiness and you just live however you please, that's the teachings of many false prophets. You guys understand? (audience laughing) Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold. And we see that in today's churches, right? But the one who endures to the end by the power of God, who are protected by the power of God through salvation for a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time, you will be enduring, okay? The gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations and the end will come. So the point of tonight is, have you met this God? And if you have, can you abide in bitterness, and unforgiveness, and lovelessness, and hate? You cannot. And that's something to wrestle with. 'Cause I think at times I wrestle with vindictiveness. If someone slaps me, I'm not like, oh, let me love you back. No, I wanna punch you back, right? It's like, hey, how dare you? But the Lord's been teaching me love. It's interesting, over the last four years, everyone I've had a falling out with in college, I've befriended in the last four years. I just had a conversation on a Zoom chat with my former roommate on Saturday night after 20 years of not really talking to him. And it was my fault. So I sought peace. Right before COVID, I ended up meeting for dinner another friend I hadn't seen in 15 years because we kinda had a falling out. It's the weirdest thing. I don't think of the person, I push them out of my mind, but God puts on my heart, hey, check in with this person, love them. And I will say, that is not something that's coming from me. It's the Lord just, mm, go reconcile with that person. It's like, go, go reconcile with that person. And when he guides me there, he provides great compassion, love, understanding, and humility. And I can't meditate on his word and stay bitter. I've discovered that. The seasons where I stay bitter is when I'm not paying any attention to his word. I'm not praying. I'm still coming to church, I'm still serving. But when I'm confronted with the word of God, when I'm praying to this living God, he changes my heart all the time. So if you're in unforgiveness, my guess is, you probably haven't been reading or praying much, or you're not a child of God. So that's something that, even if the worst possible thing has ever happened to you, if you are a child of God and you've been dunked into the ocean of his kindness and love, you can't come out just dry. Does that make sense? And that's something supernatural that God does to a heart. And if you're a Christian, he's done that already. Past tense, it's been done, but it has ongoing ramifications. Amen? So stretch those muscles so you can do the spiritual splits like crazy and not be all like, ah, okay? It's a muscle. Here's a question that I want you guys to break up and maybe share together. Are you a loving person? And that's a different question than are you nice. Okay? Some of the nicest people are the most bitter. It's weird. It's just, it's a mask. Okay, are you a loving person? Is there evidence of the effectual love of Christ in your life? Is that the fruit of the spirit that comes out when I explain, like, I go like, hey, yeah, you are such a loving person. You are such a joyful person. You're such a patient person. Is love something that's characteristic of you? And the second one is, in what ways can your group members pray for and encourage you to love a kletos, fervently? Okay, so those are the things I want you guys to discuss. And let me pray. Father, we only love in response to the love that you have for us. And as we get to know you better, I pray that you would help us to grow, to really have great compassion on our brothers and sisters in Christ, have great compassion for the lost, and ultimately, Lord, that we would spend our lives sharing your love and your kindness to the world around us. And Jesus, let me pray.
