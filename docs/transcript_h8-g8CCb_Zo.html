And we thank you for the gift of grace and the gift of faith that you have given through your son. We were once lost, we were once in darkness, and you have brought us the light of Christ. I pray, Lord, that as we intake your word and study, I pray that it would just cause us to have greater affection for you.</p><p>It will cause us to be greater lights out into the world. And in all things, may we give you glory, honor, and praise. In Christ's name, amen. - All right, good evening, everybody. Well, we're gonna go right into our discussion time. Just as a reminder to ask really good questions about the text and then just share your observations and your findings.</p><p>Last week, I announced that each week, I am going to put up my phone number and invite you guys to ask any questions or if your team or table group gets stuck on a topic, I'm gonna put up my phone number. If you have any questions or if your team or table group gets stuck on a certain question or you have some theological questions associated with the text, you can send that over and we'll have a time at the review to cover it, okay?</p><p>So go ahead and go into your discussion and at 8 o'clock, we'll be back. Thanks. - For those of you guys who are in the rooms, now that it's 59, please make your way on over, and one minute, we'll get started with the review. Okay, good, it looks like everybody is out.</p><p>Let me take a moment to pray so that we can go before the Lord asking His blessing as we cover the passage. Let's pray together. Our God, we are so thankful for Your Word. We recognize, God, that before You reveal Your truth to us, before, God, You enlighten us, before You grant to us faith in Christ, we are in such darkness.</p><p>And we recognize, God, that Your Word is washing us, and so we pray that every Bible study that we have and every interaction with the Scripture, it would be thoroughly sanctifying, and, God, that it would be nourishing our soul. We pray that our hearts would be so receptive to Your correction, and no matter how severe or even over the top it may feel to us, that, God, we will receive with humility.</p><p>We thank You in Christ's name. Amen. Okay, great, so come on in, everybody. It's always good to do a little bit of a review, okay? And so if you recall, chapter 4, verses 1 through 7, our last week, essentially, He was trying to show to us, "Listen, this is the gospel that you believed.</p><p>This is your before and after, the great conversion." And just by way of a little table here, before Christ, He was trying to reiterate and impress this thought, "You're like a slave child. You have such limitations over you. You have no rights, you have no claims, you have no resources, and you're underneath a heavy hand, right?</p><p>You're in bondage, and you're under the elemental things of the world." And even if religious leaders, political leaders, whoever it is, has systems for you, last week I gave the analogy, all it is is child's play. It's like a bunch of kids making rules, playing make-believe. None of it is worth anything.</p><p>And then the emphatic, just great privilege we have in the gospel is, but instead, at that fullness of time, we have adoptions of sons. We have this great, great grace of God by which we are heirs, heirs to the promise, right? And so last week was showing us this contrast, and it leads up to this week's massively just like heavy question of-- and I use the term "frustration"-- how in the world can you go back then?</p><p>You have an adoption by the king of the universe, and one of the things I was reflecting on this week was trying to meditate on that adoption. And one thought that crossed my mind after the teaching was, "Man, it's crazy to think. In our generation, adoption typically happens when-- or fortunate situation where there is a child who, whatever the situation, the parents are not capable of taking care of, but most often it's a child.</p><p>But imagine a grown adult. Imagine like a 35-year-old coming to you and asking you, "Can I be your son?" It just wouldn't make sense, right? Number one, it's incredibly inappropriate to ask that question. Number two, you would automatically assume, "Are you after my money?" That would be the question, right?</p><p>But then to think that it is in God's kind intention to give us his inheritance, it's crazy to think about. And so in thinking about it, what you have in the gospel, he's asking that question, "How in the world do you go back?" And then so this week, he's going to be asking that question with a review of another layer of what it is that we have in the gospel.</p><p>So by way of just quick overview, I separated it, verse 8 through 11, as the first half of today's paragraph. Thinking through, knowing God now, are you going back to slavery? And then part two, starting from verse 11 and forward, and the reason why I say that is because that section starting from verse 11 down, he gets personal all the way down to verse 20, but it's a very heartfelt, personal plea saying, "I'm begging you, don't go down this route, right?</p><p>"Be faithful to the Lord as I am." So as we think about that, let's jump right in to the first half of our paragraph for tonight. And you can see immediately just the contrast of the gospel encapsulated into this idea of, just like last time, before conversion, before Christ, this was you, right?</p><p>At that time. So these words give you those indications, but now that this is showing you this contrast and we need to appreciate that, right? And then this is the big, big push, emphatically asking the question, "Then how is it that you turn back?" And we're going to take some time meditating on it.</p><p>Taking it a little bit more precise or specific to verse 8, if he is trying to help us focus in or have us concentrate and think about our lives former or prior to Christ, right? What is it in terms of our former life that he wants us to think about that's different from last time?</p><p>Is he just doing a second run so that he gives you a one-two punch in the face? Or is there something more specific he wants us to think about? And if you'll notice, there are two things. One is this idea, okay, that you did not know God. And then two is a reiteration of the idea that you were slaves, okay?</p><p>So you have two thoughts there. And I do think that one of the questions that came in-- thanks for sending it in earlier-- is one of the questions was here, when it gives you this contrast about knowing God, are they using the same words or is it different? And they are different.</p><p>Meaning, the very first thing he tells us here is that before Christ, you did not know God, and the word used is "oida." And then later in verse 9 when he says, "Now you do know him," right? And he uses the word "gnosko," showing you the vastness of that contrast.</p><p>Another way to put it is, prior to Christ opening your eyes, prior to the Spirit working in your life, you're not even able to perceive him. You're not even able to recognize him. The word "oida" has the idea of knowing a fact. The word "oida" has the idea of being able to perceive something.</p><p>"Oh, I recognize that. I observe." "Gnosko" is actually knowing something, either by way of experience, knowing something completely, or you're in the full process of knowing something. So in that sense, it's like saying, "Before, you didn't even recognize him." That would be one way of putting that. And so, as we think about that, I want us to kind of have a moment just immediately of self-evaluation.</p><p>Because what we see is Apostle Paul and the Scriptures, the Word trying to show us, maybe in the people's mind, they may be thinking, "Well, all I was doing was, in the life of the Church, "we were being taught this thing "about rituals and days and circumcision and whatnot." But the way that Apostle Paul is talking is saying, "No, no, no, you don't understand.</p><p>"By going to that, you're acting like you don't even know him." And so, here's a quick evaluation question. It's like--you know, I'll put it this way. There's a question for you. In the ways that we talk, in the ways that we act, are there ways that we behave that signify that we're talking like somebody who doesn't know God?</p><p>What I mean is, you have a situation with a bunch of people who are converts within the Church. They're now, all of a sudden, following somebody else's teaching. And Apostle Paul is pointing at that. It's like, "Dude, you're going back to that time "when you had no idea who God was.</p><p>"You didn't even recognize him." Is there anything in our lives that's kind of like that? Well, I would like to bring up one case scenario that I was kind of meditating on and thinking about as a way of quick evaluation. And it comes down to the question of, there are specific moments and instances in which we are tested, and we are, like, duped and deceived by our enemy.</p><p>And the specific instances are typically in moments when we suffer. When I look at the way that mainstream Christianity handles suffering, I ask this question. Why are we suffering like we don't know God? Some of the main, just, voices, some of the main, just, mantras, taglines, and things commonly said amongst those who suffer, those who feel like they're being put down or oppressed, are things like, "I am man, hear me roar.</p><p>"No one's gonna put me down." Right? People talking like, "You know what? "I'm not gonna allow any of these negative forces "to be around me. "I'm gonna remove anything that feels "like it's oppressing me. "I am woman, hear me roar." I've even heard people say things like, "You know what?</p><p>"I've been through this, and I've been through that. "Ask me, ask me about my suffering." My first response to that was, "Why are we talking like we don't have Jesus? "Why are we talking like we don't have the Holy Spirit "who's our great comforter and counselor, "someone who is with us and walking with us?</p><p>"Why do we talk like that?" Or, on the flip side, in the midst of suffering, if we're not trying to fight so that we can survive, people are saying, "Dude, my life is over. "Why do we say things like that? "Why do we act like we have nothing else to live for?</p><p>"Really? "Our life is done?" In those ways, that's what I mean. It's like if we turn back and talk like the world, we talk like we don't know God, right? Okay, so in this contrast, I wanted to just highlight the fact that there is an emphasis in the previous.</p><p>He was talking about how we were like slave-like children. You had no rights, no privileges, no inheritance, but now you have adoption. In this, in the second run of the gospel, essentially, he's saying before you did not know God, but now you do. You know him. And so here we have the turn, right?</p><p>The contrast in the gospel where he says, "You know God," and then he says, "Rather, you are known by God." And so he asked that emphatic question, how then do you try and go back? You know him, okay? You know him. We have to ask this question, what is the difference here between you knowing God versus you being known by God, right?</p><p>Is this just him kind of giving a sequence where he says, "You know, what happened in the gospel "was that you pursued the Lord "and you wanted to find who he was, "and then he came and met you and said, 'Ta-da, here I am. "'You found me.'" Right? How is he describing this?</p><p>And I hope you got an opportunity to discuss it within your groups, okay? Here, I want to highlight to you a couple passages. This is a common theme within the scriptures that you guys know to be true. There is a sense in which we can look at things from our angle, okay, from the human angle.</p><p>And from our angle, I have to pursue the Lord. I have to decide to receive. I have to decide to follow. That is true. But scripture says there is this theme, no, no, no. You exercise faith, you love because he loved first. Jesus straight up tells you, "You did not choose me, but I chose you." So does the scripture talk about our decision?</p><p>The answer is yes. A passage that I don't have on here is John 1, verse 12. "To all who received him, to those who believed in his name, "he gave the right to become children of God." Which means, yes, for you, when you hear the word, the way that you experience it is, "Today I must make this decision." But scripture is telling you nobody can come, nobody can make that decision, nobody would ever be inclined, right?</p><p>No human in their fleshly mind would even be inclined to make that choice unless the Father drew him and gave him that faith, okay? Why is that important? Why does that matter to this discussion? Because true faith has with it this question, how does God work? And basically what Apostle Paul is saying is, you know how God works.</p><p>You know the way that he has accomplished redemption. If you've ever just walked through the Old Testament, you know nobody touches his glory. Nobody takes credit for the deliverance. Nobody takes credit for his masterful might that he exercised in Egypt. Nobody takes credit for what he did in deliverance from the Philistines, from any nation, any tribe.</p><p>God alone deserves glory, amen? When we receive grace, it's to us his love, but when we receive grace, it's to him his glory. You don't touch it. How in the world? And you know him. You've seen how he works. How in the world do you go back then, acting like you don't know?</p><p>That's the question, okay? Now, because the emphatic question is asked right here, right, like how? We can take it like just a, you know, what they call a hypothetical rhetorical question that's not supposed to be answered. It's just supposed to emphatically tell you you're just being ridiculous, right? But actually, it's important for us to ask and then sit there and meditate, right?</p><p>Don't pass that by. I'm gonna make this a discussion question for you guys in application to ask and then to answer why is it that Christians who can actually experience a lot of fruit in their lives, later we're gonna notice the Christians in this area, did they exhibit some fruit?</p><p>Oh, yeah. At the tail end of this paragraph that we're looking at, Apostle Paul commends them saying, "You did all that for me. "You received me. "You received the message. "You took care of me," all that stuff, right? And what's more, Acts chapter 4, actually, I think it's Acts chapter 12, but when Apostle Paul is there in Galatia, it talks about how they were just imploring the disciples, imploring Apostle Paul, "Stay and speak to us.</p><p>"Give us more. "Preach it." I mean, they were the best congregation to preach to. So did they exhibit some fruit? Yes. Then how can fruit-bearing Christians constantly go back to their former way of life? Why does that happen? Take some time to meditate on that. Well, I want to give you some of my thoughts, and I don't want to, like, take all the different options, but I do want you guys to think about the fact that, like, yes, sometimes, like, we are simple-minded, meaning there are a lot of us who just kind of want to be told, and then if somebody asks you, like, "Wait a minute.</p><p>"Why are you doing that?" Your only response is, like, "He told me to do it," right? Like, that's our only answer is, like, "I wasn't really thinking," right? Sometimes there's self-will, like, "I want to be the one to accomplish something." Sometimes there's just deep feelings. It's like, "Oh, my gosh, but my brother was in that group, "and, oh, my gosh, like, "they were making me feel so guilty about this, "and I don't want to be a jerk to tell them no," and sometimes we're just driven by feelings.</p><p>Just talk about that a little bit. If you're asking the question, think about even self-evaluation for you. I know we have seasons of great fruit-bearing as a Christian, and then we have times when we start reverting back to our old ways. Why? Well, one of the things here, he says, you have this desire.</p><p>Now, this, I think, is a little bit more sarcastic, right? Like, you don't understand that when you do this, you're enslaving yourself. Again, is that what you want? But then, he says, as an example, this is what you do. This is an example. Sorry, my handwriting there is so good, okay?</p><p>I hope you get an example. You observe days, months, seasons, and years, okay? You observe days, months, seasons, and years. Now, obviously, my guess is a lot of you thought, like, "Oh, okay, he's so talking probably to the Jewish people "because they have so many different days, months," right?</p><p>You have everything from weekly Sabbath, then you have the quarterly, you know, the new moon, you have harvest, you have, like, the day of booths, and then you have that Yom Kippur, which is, like, super important. Then you have Rosh Hashanah. Like, you have so many significant moments in terms of the days they have to remember and celebrate, right?</p><p>But actually, I think last week, I said, "You know, Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians, "he actually encompassed all of them." And he said, "You guys, you guys keep turning to the elemental things, "and you guys keep succumbing to people's judgment over you "through these elemental things." And he mentions to the Jewish people, he mentions Sabbath, new moon, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>But then he also talks about those individuals who look to stars, and what are they doing? They're looking at their mystic calendar, they're looking at astrology, they're looking at horoscope, they're looking at stuff like, "Oh, my gosh, it's the Year of the Dragon!" Right? All this stuff. Whether Jewish or pagan, there's all these days that people look at.</p><p>But why am I making note of that? I do think that there is a kind of, I guess, simplicity. I guess there's a-- when I think about it, when you think about the easiest form of legalism, it's just to follow along, it's just to show up. It's like, you know, I pray when it's scheduled time to pray.</p><p>I prayed. You're done. And the rest of the week, rest of the month, you're like, "Oh, yeah, I never really prayed." So for you, I have this question. If Sunday you put your, "Okay, I'm going to start the Bible cap on," and then the rest of the week, when it's not time, when it's not scheduled, when we're not gathered, you don't have a hunger for Jesus, you don't have a hunger to please him, you don't have a hunger to evangelize, you're not really seeking him out, but then you put your caps on on those appointed times, what are you doing?</p><p>You're just observing days, months, and years, right? And why do we do that then? It's because that's easy. And how is that offensive to God? Because for you to think, "Look, God, I washed my hands. Do you love me?" Or, "Look, God, I showed up on Sunday. Do you love me?" "Look, God, I kept Saturday clear for you." Do you think God is that easily pleased?</p><p>Do you think God is that easily manipulated? "But I washed my hands. You expected me to do more?" That's a weird way to think of God. The reason why legalism is so offensive to God is because God was a God who was offended. He was a holy God who was offended by our sin.</p><p>We come, and it's like, "But I washed my hands on Saturday." That's such a weird way to see God. Does that make sense? We put God in a strange place where he's supposed to accept our bare minimum. That's why legalism is offensive to the Lord. Okay, so in thinking about that, I want us to know, like, this little portion we should discuss.</p><p>In what ways is observing days, months, and seasons such an easy thing for you and I to fall into? In what ways? Maybe it's a way in which you've sinned or fallen short or you failed in some way. If you just put your cap on on Wednesday and you act like nothing happened, you're just observing the days, right?</p><p>It has to do with dealing with your heart. It has to do with getting right with God. And these are the things we know. Okay, so in thinking about this, I want to make a side note here. The tone. Last week, I kept mentioning and asking this question about the tone.</p><p>And obviously, the tone is, like, really serious, right? The tone is filled with both frustration, both just an astounded, like, "What?" But it's also filled with a lot of concern. The whole paragraph has with so much fear, concern, and worry in it. And I wanted to make a side note that when he is describing the weak and the worthless, these were some really descriptive terms.</p><p>If you got a chance to look at this one in particular, you will notice that in your translations, it was translated into multiple different ways. The miserable, the beggarly, because the term has a broad sense and meaning. It is this word here, and it's very descriptive, as one who is crouching, one who is cowering like a beggar, one who is poor, helpless, someone who is in abject poverty, utter helplessness, or complete destruction.</p><p>Whoa. That is one rich term. This is the many uses in different places that this term was used. And then if you look at the variations of this word, it continues to basically reiterate this thought that it is like a beggar. And then so, in terms of the tone of this paragraph, it made me think, how heart-wrenching, right?</p><p>How heart-wrenching to think if you were the one who was in the God figure, the parental figure, and you prepared, again, not just days and months, but years for the adoption of a child. You prepared your home, you prepared the documents, you prepared your family, you prepared your friends.</p><p>Not even like a homecoming party, all of that, only to receive the child into your home and then to catch him digging through your trash. Half of you would be like, "Oh, what are you doing?" But the other half of you would feel pity. Is that what you're used to, right?</p><p>I think the tone of it has the same kind of thought. Why? Because in this admonition and in this charge to not go back to the flesh, here he starts to get really personal and says, "I fear for you, that perhaps I labor for you in vain. "I'm begging you." I want to switch now to the second half of the paragraph and to highlight that the paragraph actually goes all the way down to verse 20, okay?</p><p>It goes all the way down to verse 20. And essentially, he starts to share his worried concern and then he starts to bring up their relationships. He says, "Oh my goodness, before you were so good to me, "what changed? "By me telling you not to go down this horrible path, "am I now your enemy?</p><p>"What's happening?" And he's so perplexed and he starts to call on them like his children and he says, "I wish I was with you." And so that's why I bring up that analogy. The tone is very, very intimate, okay? As we think about this, I'm pretty sure you guys wondered like, "Oh man, this is crazy." He asked this question, "Perhaps I labored over you in vain." And I asked the question, "Does Paul think that they are not Christian?" "Does Paul think that they are not Christian?" Well, I think this is why sometimes the Scripture is so profound because it includes all the real emotions.</p><p>If you guys have ever tried to disciple, minister to, or draw back a wayward Christian, now your mind is going all over the place like, "Why won't you listen?" Right? And then the thought starts coming like, "Your heart's getting hardened." And then you start worrying and then you start actually wondering, "Is the truth in you?" Right?</p><p>But then praise the Lord, he later on in Galatians 5.10 says, "I have this confidence in you in the Lord. "You will not adopt another view." Right? And he calls them brothers and he's praying for them and all this kind of stuff. So all I'm going to say is, this is just like a very real passage where he starts to get very personal about his sentiments towards the church.</p><p>Okay? And then that leads him to beg, to beg them. Okay? And I want to make the point and highlight the fact that in his begging, he is pleading with them, he is entreating them. And again, the translations kind of show that this is another vivid, vivid term. And the way that that term is used most frequently in the scriptures is when somebody is going to God and making a prayer request and saying, "God, this is not my preference.</p><p>"This is my dire need." When it boils down to, "If I had one opportunity to go to you "and I'm requesting you this," this is that kind of prayer. It's most often used in a prayer context. Okay? Most often used in a prayer context. So then, knowing that Apostle Paul is making that kind of emphatic pleading with the church, what is he actually asking for when he says, "Become as I am, "for also I have become as you are." Honestly, that's where in my own Bible study, I was like, "What?</p><p>"What do you mean?" So what did you guys get? Eye contact? (laughs) Any thoughts? Volunteer? This is an important one because this is the command. Become as I am. What a weird way to put it. And I've become like you. Thoughts? Going once? For 10 points? Twice? Okay. Well, I'm going to read you a parallel passage just to get the effect of it, okay?</p><p>What does it mean to become as I am? Well, in a very similar tone, in a very similar seriousness of the text that we're in, in the book of Philippians, Apostle Paul says here with really, really fierce words, "Beware of the dogs." Wow. But it's actually really, really similar to the way that Apostle Paul speaks in Galatians.</p><p>It's like, "Those individuals who would disturb you, "I wish they would mutilate themselves." He says, "Beware of the evil workers. "Beware of the false circumcision." Moving forward to verse 4. "If anyone else has a mind "to put confidence in the flesh, "I far more circumcise the eighth day "of the nation of Israel, "of the tribe of Benjamin, "a Hebrew of Hebrews, "as to the law of Pharisee, "as to zeal of persecutor of the church, "as to the righteousness "which is in the law found blameless.</p><p>"But whatever things were gained to me, "those things I have counted as loss "for the sake of Christ, "become like me. "I have believed upon the sufficiency of Christ. "I place no, no glory in my flesh, "but glory in only Christ. "Amen? "Be like me." And then he says, "Moreover, "more than that, "I count all things to be lost "in view of the surpassing value "of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, "for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, "and count them rubbish "so that I may gain Christ "and may be found in him.</p><p>"Not having a righteousness of my own "derived from the law, "but that which through faith in Christ, "the righteousness which comes from God "on the basis of faith, "that I may know him "and the power of his resurrection "and the fellowship of his suffering, "being conformed to his death "in order that I may attain "to the resurrection from the dead.</p><p>"Be like me." This is what you believed, right? The absolute sufficiency of Christ. Guys, in a way, kind of like summarizing some of this stuff, I genuinely feel like we are, in different ways similarly, attacked with superficial, very, very earthly, fleshly ideologies, just as powerful as blatant legalism. Blatant legalism is, you must be circumcised to be saved and righteous.</p><p>Yes? Are there not those attacks in a different tone today? You must say the right stuff. You must be of this camp. You must be about social justice. You must be about this. And there are movements and stuff like that. But anything, anything that you experience that gives you confidence in the flesh, it is utterly demonic.</p><p>And if it feels like, oh my gosh, why are the teachers, the elders, the pastors always so serious about this? Think about this. I mean, the Apostle Paul is mentioning just days, rituals, and stuff like that. And he says, "But do you understand? "It's like you're acting like you don't know God.</p><p>"You're going back to slavery." So I can imagine, I can imagine somebody in the church saying like, "Oh my gosh, why are you taking it so hard, you know? "In the beginning we were just doing Bible study "and it was great. "And then these guys who are leaders "of the Jewish people, "they came in and were like, "'Wow, this is great,' "because they converted.</p><p>"And then they were telling us like, "'We have to be holy,' "and it sounded good. "And we have to follow the law of God." And we said, "Amen." And then they said, "We have to be circumcised." And we were like, "Oh, I don't know, but I guess." You know, why are you taking this so seriously?</p><p>Apostle Paul is trying to show us the consequences of even just that kind of perversion of the gospel. You make Christ null and void, right? And so he's awaking us to those kinds of thoughts. This last, last segment, I'm gonna actually save majority of it for the next time, because the flow of thought here, verse 12b, it's kind of like a weird place to put the verses, but I had this question like, "Whoa, is verse 12 through 14 "trying to support this idea of like, "'I beg you to become like me,' right?</p><p>"Or is this a separate thought?" My just preview for the next time is going to be this is a movement of his personal thoughts. "I fear for you. "I'm begging you. "And you and I have this relationship, right? "You trusted me before. "You were so good to me. "Before, you never did me wrong.</p><p>"I was super-duper sick." I think Apostle Paul describes like he was so near death because of his illnesses, and then he moved over to this Galatia area, and then in that moment, he had to move over because of his sickness, but while he was moving, he was preaching, and there was fruitfulness there.</p><p>So what he was saying was, "Because of my sickness, God allowed me to come here "and I was preaching to you, "and at that time, you didn't think of me as a burden. "You received me. "You received all my words." And then it's going to be a setup for, "So where is that, right?</p><p>"What happened?" And then what can we observe then about their relationship is although we would like to think that we're humble enough to receive exhortation, that we're humble enough to receive rebuke, you can tell the church had moments when they were not. They probably started accusing Apostle Paul of being lesser than them.</p><p>They were like, "What are you doing? "You're trying to mess up this good thing we have." I don't know what they said exactly, but Apostle Paul now is grieving like, "Man, I loved upon you. "I taught you. "What happened?" Right? "What happened?" And so with that said, stay tuned for next time when you guys study the passage going from verse 15 through 20, think about the ministry.</p><p>Think about the relationship. Think about how Apostle Paul is treating those who are bearing fruit at once, being swayed to believe this false gospel, and perhaps now being defensive about it in this time. All right, let's take a moment to pray to wrap up. Lord God, there was so much to glean from this passage, but Lord, the theme of the Scripture is to stay on Christ, that Lord, having a relationship with you, that's the substance.</p><p>Everything else is just a help. Everything else is a tool for us to get to you. Even your law, even what you've taught in the Old Testament, all the examples were for us to fully see you. And so I pray, Father God, that we would be so clinging to Christ that we're not susceptible to movements of our day, spectacular preachers of our day, and definitely we're not susceptible to our own laziness and vices.</p><p>I pray, Father God, that if any of us here, that we were coasting along and we were just showing up, but Lord God, we weren't hungering for you, would you cause us now to be rebuked, corrected, and then to realize, Lord God, that we need to be seeking you with all our hearts.</p><p>Father, we pray that by the nourishment and the conviction of your Spirit, you would help us, Lord God, to walk with you daily. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. All right, with that said, we have just a few announcements for you guys, and then we'll put up the discussion questions.</p><p>All right, just a couple of announcements. We are going to try to close the men's ministry workshop. Please do sign up by tonight so that I can put the small groups together tomorrow. The $10 is going to include breakfast, refreshments, as well as a catered lunch. So Pastor Sung Kang is coming from Foundation Mission Church, and he's going to be sharing about just the personal holiness of the men.</p><p>So ladies, if you can pray that the men of our church really will grow in holiness that we better serve the church as we grow. So if you haven't signed up by now, please do so, okay, so that we can kind of put the groups together. Also, March 9th, which is just a few Saturdays away, we are having an all-church cleaning and maintenance day.</p><p>If you guys can come, the more the merrier, please do come. It's going to be from like 9 to 12. It is a good opportunity really to just kind of clear out and clean up the facility. And a couple of upcoming things that are important to remember. Next Friday, the BAM is going to just the winter retreat.</p><p>So if you guys can keep that in prayer. The theme is "The End is Near," okay? And it's ominous, but that's the theme. And we're going to be looking at 1 Peter 4 for the whole of the retreat. So please pray for that. Next Wednesday night we have Bible study.</p><p>And then the following week we don't because that week we have all-church praise and prayer. And Pastor Peter Kim is going to be leading us through that time. So kind of book that on your calendar. And then our six-week Old Testament survey class, Pastor Peter announced this on Sunday.</p><p>That's going to go from 2 to 3.30-ish every Sunday afternoon in the sanctuary. So please sign up for that if you are preparing to come. Over the last five or six years, we've had evening Passion Week devotions and stuff. And so this year it's not going to be any different Monday through Wednesday at 7.30.</p><p>We're going to be gathering together for just a time of reflection, devotion. The BAM is going to have a prayer meeting on that Tuesday before the evening. And then Thursday, it's actually going to be pulled up the time, and we're going to have a Passover dinner. And so Pastor Mark is going to be walking us through how a first-century Jewish family would actually have the Passover feast.</p><p>So it definitely is worthwhile to participate in, especially if you haven't done it before. So if you are a member and you've never done it, you're going to be given priority. So seating is limited. You are going to be asked. We're going to treat it like a formal event.</p><p>So that'll be Thursday. Friday, we're going to have a Good Friday service with communion. So please also keep that in mind in addition to our Sunday sunrise service followed by three services. So these are things that are upcoming. More than just to put on the calendar, just blanket these events in prayer for all the leaders that are involved and try to make it to everything and really be present.</p><p>Thank you. These are the discussion questions we're going to leave you with, and then we'll wrap up our Bible study formally this way. Thank you.
