would say in a place like that, you guys probably shouldn't like be hanging out together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=66s">00:01:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in a room like that, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=67s">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to define what hanging out is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=71s">00:01:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it grabbing a meal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=75s">00:01:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=76s">00:01:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Largely, and this is generally, please understand what I'm saying by generally, I wouldn't encourage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=83s">00:01:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a one-on-one hangout with just a guy and a

like be having relationships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=91s">00:01:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with a brother or sister but things just tend to happen and then secondly, you don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=102s">00:01:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't, like I said before, you can't control the other person's heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=105s">00:01:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so even if you're keeping it casual and things like that, you have no control over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=109s">00:01:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=110s">00:01:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So generally, I would say not hanging out with opposite gender is wiser alone anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=118s">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a big proponent of like, you know, hanging out in groups and I get to know people through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=123s">00:02:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">groups in group settings.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=127s">00:02:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to know people well through there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=130s">00:02:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually sometimes I wonder if in the, like in the dating sense, like on that one-on-one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=137s">00:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, like you actually tend to very directly display what you want that other person, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=145s">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you want that other person to see about yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=146s">00:02:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you're like honed in on this one person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=149s">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But in group settings, you're going to like see them interact with this person and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=152s">00:02:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">person, you'll get a better

the question in a direct way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=161s">00:02:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, second one, what are some warning signs signaling you should break up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=165s">00:02:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember those warnings that I put, like when there's like manipulation, obsession.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=169s">00:02:49.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=177s">00:02:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">When you see it becoming unhealthy and it is damaging not only that relationship but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=185s">00:03:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like the relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=195s">00:03:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">say there are certain places where it wouldn't merit like just ending it and taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=202s">00:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people like think about like can we just take a break, you know, because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=206s">00:03:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to kind of hold on to the relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325987949#t=208s">00:03:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I would encourage not taking breaks as much as
