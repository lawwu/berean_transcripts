sure that the people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=67s">00:01:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in leadership are people that

not only do we want the elders in the church to understand that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=77s">00:01:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to make sure that the church understands that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=80s">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to make sure that the testing, again, you know, we were kind of going back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=88s">00:01:28.580</a></span> | <span

class="t">When we did it the first time with the, you know, elders that we have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=96s">00:01:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we did it publicly because our church was very small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=98s">00:01:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we wanted the, for the same reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=100s">00:01:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was the one who tested the three of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=103s">00:01:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they were three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=104s">00:01:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was in a small room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=105s">00:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And how many of you were here for the first time when we did that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=109s">00:01:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's only a handful of you, probably less than 15 of you, less than 10, 15 of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=113s">00:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So majority were not there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=115s">00:01:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So they also went through the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=117s">00:01:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Except this time it's just James by himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=120s">00:02:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought it would be too much pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=122s">00:02:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but again, he was up for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=125s">00:02:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if he's up for it, let's do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=126s">00:02:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know? And so initially we were thinking about doing it just kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=129s">00:02:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just a small group upstairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=131s">00:02:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we're thinking 40, 50 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=133s">00:02:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the number started growing to 90.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=135s">00:02:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people were asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=136s">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I said, okay, we're not going to fit up there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=138s">00:02:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we chose to do it down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=139s">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to share in Titus chapter 1, 5 through 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=146s">00:02:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=152s">00:02:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and appoint elders in every city as I directed you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=155s">00:02:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If you notice in verse 5, he says, Paul is sending Timothy back to Crete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=161s">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, "To set in order what remains."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=164s">00:02:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What remains, meaning unfinished business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=167s">00:02:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So Apostle Paul went and he preached the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=169s">00:02:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And there were Christians already there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=171s">00:02:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But he said the work is not finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=173s">00:02:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in order to finish the work, he says, "I appoint, go back and appoint elders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=177s">00:02:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in every city as I directed you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=179s">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the church is not established until the elders are established.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=183s">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paul's intent in every city that he goes is to establish the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=186s">00:03:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the church wasn't complete until they had proper elders there to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=190s">00:03:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to govern the shepherd and to teach the group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=192s">00:03:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you notice, he uses the elders in plural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=196s">00:03:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't say establish an elder, but establish elders in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=199s">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we do in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=202s">00:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We establish elders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=204s">00:03:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And as our church grows, you know, people ask, "We have such a big church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=208s">00:03:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How come we only have so many elders?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=210s">00:03:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because eldership isn't something you appoint out of necessity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=213s">00:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we don't establish elders because we have 500, so we need 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=217s">00:03:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's get the next 14 people in here and we plug them in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=220s">00:03:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you make a mistake in eldership, it unravels the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=225s">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's better to have less elders than to have elders that we are not confident in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=230s">00:03:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's part of the reason why we've been very, very, very slow in establishing elders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=235s">00:03:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to make sure that we are taking that seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=238s">00:03:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">In verse 7, you know, there's a bunch of qualifications that we can look at, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=249s">00:04:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point of that this afternoon is not to go through every single one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=252s">00:04:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But he says in verse 7 that this man, obviously above reproach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=257s">00:04:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but not self-willed nor quick-tempered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=260s">00:04:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just want to highlight quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=262s">00:04:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">When he says not self-willed, self-willed meaning that you don't become an elder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=266s">00:04:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">because you desire and you look for and you shoot for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=269s">00:04:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've done certain things and maneuvered and then so you got noticed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=273s">00:04:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And how come I'm not an elder?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=274s">00:04:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the elder must not be self-willed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=277s">00:04:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not something that he wants for worldly or selfish reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=282s">00:04:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, he must not be quick-tempered.</span></div><div

elders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=290s">00:04:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's meant to have discussions, right?</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=305s">00:05:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the church is meant to be discussed among the elders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=310s">00:05:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if a man is quick-tempered and he doesn't know how to explain himself,</span></div><div

because of what we see in Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=382s">00:06:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to make sure that every elder in the church is able to argue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=387s">00:06:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in the context of

rebuke and refute them to protect the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=411s">00:06:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the elder is not only to govern the church, to shepherd the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=415s">00:06:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but also to protect the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=416s">00:06:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, more elders who are able to handle the Word of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=422s">00:07:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and who understand what the Word of God says, it will add to ultimately what we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=426s">00:07:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to establish in the church, what God is trying to establish in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=429s">00:07:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">To

href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=438s">00:07:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me just give you a broad outline of what we asked him to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=443s">00:07:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So beginning of last year, we asked to confirm if there was any strong opposition in the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=450s">00:07:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to establish, you know, possibly add him as a candidate as eldership in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=455s">00:07:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We had basically 99% approval in the church and with some concerns of certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=463s">00:07:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, we've scrutinized, we've talked to him in a lot of details,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=469s">00:07:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to go over that in the part of the testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=471s">00:07:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've dealt with certain things that came up, certain things that we already knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=479s">00:07:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Certain things that we wanted to bring to light to see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=482s">00:08:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure that he understand to what degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=484s">00:08:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, some of that is going to come up in the discussion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=487s">00:08:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">because the testing isn't simply about knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=489s">00:08:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The majority of it is about can he handle the Word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=492s">00:08:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, we want them to be aware, and we want you to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=497s">00:08:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we weren't just dealing with knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=499s">00:08:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If the position of eldership is important to this degree that we would test a man publicly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=509s">00:08:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to know the Word of God to this degree, we also want you to understand that his character</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=514s">00:08:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and certain things that we may have had concerns, certain things that you may have noticed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=518s">00:08:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that we took that very, very seriously, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=521s">00:08:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If for any reason there was a blind spot, we wanted to make sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=525s">00:08:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've dealt with how he deals with people, dealing with money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=531s">00:08:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">both his public and private life at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=534s">00:08:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are a lot of things that we've kind of walked through with James in the past year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=539s">00:08:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And even in the last year, I can honestly say just from personally meeting with him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=543s">00:09:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's examined himself carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=547s">00:09:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And even in the last year, there's been -- that we've noticed progress, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=551s">00:09:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's been times I've sat in front of James literally in tears, just broken over his sins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=558s">00:09:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">broken over his mistakes, that he really wants to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=562s">00:09:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and recognizing what it means to be an elder in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=566s">00:09:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want you to be aware of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=568s">00:09:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It says in 1 Timothy 3, 6 that he must not be a new convert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=573s">00:09:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or else he falls into the temptation of the devil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=575s">00:09:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we don't take this lightly because becoming a leader makes it difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=580s">00:09:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to serve the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=581s">00:09:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't help because when the spotlight is on that person, there is that temptation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=587s">00:09:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to be concerned about what people think, right, naturally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=591s">00:09:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's more people looking at that person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=593s">00:09:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if a brand new convert or somebody who's young who can't handle that can easily get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=598s">00:09:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to their head, either become overly concerned about criticism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=601s">00:10:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or overly concerned about praise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=604s">00:10:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of these things have been considered in the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=610s">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of preparing and getting him ready, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=612s">00:10:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to get into the testing portion of it, but I want you to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=615s">00:10:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that because of time constraint, obviously, we're not going to be able to answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=619s">00:10:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">ask every question that we ask him to prepare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=621s">00:10:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically know this, we basically asked him that from Genesis to Revelation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=627s">00:10:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if we pick any chapter in the Bible that he needs to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=630s">00:10:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to give us an outline, tell us what's in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=632s">00:10:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He needs to be able to know the chronological order of all the events</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=637s">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Old Testament and the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=638s">00:10:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">He needs to be able to refute any doctrine that we hold and any false doctrines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=646s">00:10:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that may be going around, and so we need to prepare for all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=648s">00:10:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, the parameters, there were probably no parameters, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=654s">00:10:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, when he asked what should I study, basically, we said everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=657s">00:10:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as he was studying, we kind of narrowed it down, saying like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=662s">00:11:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now you can narrow it down to this, and then we gave him, you know, three months out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=665s">00:11:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, focus on this, and then three weeks out, we tell him to focus on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=669s">00:11:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and so that's how we got here, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=671s">00:11:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to choose different parts of it, and it's going to take about an hour, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=677s">00:11:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or we're thinking it's going to take an hour, or a little bit less than that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=682s">00:11:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and we hope that's what we're shooting for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=683s">00:11:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the format of what we're going to do is we're going to have the Old Testament portion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=687s">00:11:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">New Testament portion, and the theological portion,

up to that point, right before Acts 15, right, you have Acts chapter 8, where Philip is going to Samaria and preaches to the Ethiopian eunuch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1326s">00:22:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You have Acts chapter 10 and 11, like I just described, where the Holy Spirit fell on Cornelius and his

bottom line difference, because you're viewing one pursuant to a covenant, and one pursuant to God working, for the most part, in different ways throughout different times,</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1532s">00:25:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you're looking at something specifically through a covenant, God is working this way, and

little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1545s">00:25:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With covenant theologians, what they will say is, "All the promises to national Israel have now been disinherited and are now fulfilled in Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1555s">00:25:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they say that because of their framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1561s">00:26:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Dispensational theologians will not say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1564s">00:26:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll say, "The promises with respect to the nation of Israel are still binding, and they will occur."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1573s">00:26:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have in Isaiah 49, for example, where God says, "You're the new Israel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1579s">00:26:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter says the same thing, "We are the

we're the new Israel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1586s">00:26:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And covenant theologians, the other argument is, throughout time, God has, in essence, at many times, disinherited a majority of the population, hence the term "remnant."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1598s">00:26:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He always says "remnant."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1600s">00:26:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But where that fails, in my opinion at least, I'm sorry there isn't a covenant theologian here, but I'm trying to be objective here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=1608s">00:26:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The portion where that fails is that the

because I felt that he would add,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4527s">01:15:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and he would add to our

for over a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4538s">01:15:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We've all seen him from college and mature and married life, and again, as a DA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4544s">01:15:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that I just, this is more of a personal thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4549s">01:15:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when I turned 50, you know, I started thinking about next generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4554s">01:15:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It just, it wasn't just by choice, it was just, you know, that's just the kind of process you go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4559s">01:15:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm thinking the next, you know, I don't know when, when that would happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4565s">01:16:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That may happen in my 60s, it might happen in my 70s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4568s">01:16:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but at some point the elders in the church have to take charge of transition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4573s">01:16:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I was thinking that, we need, I felt the need for somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4577s">01:16:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">who is going to be able to articulate the doctrine, articulate the position,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4581s">01:16:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe even to a certain degree to fight for the things that we need in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4587s">01:16:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as I was thinking through these things, I mean, James, to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4591s">01:16:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, has been that guy already in the church for many, many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4595s">01:16:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, the reason why I wanted him to join the eldership is because at some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4602s">01:16:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">whether that's five years, ten years down the line,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4605s">01:16:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that, again, and I'm not saying that I have these thoughts in my mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4610s">01:16:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but at some point we don't want to wait until I'm right there and something happens and then we're not ready.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4616s">01:16:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the elders who are installed and, you know, running the church needs to be able to be strong enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4624s">01:17:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, let's say even if I was not here, and to be able to transition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4628s">01:17:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and to be able to handle that at some point, whether that's ten years, 15, 20 years from now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4633s">01:17:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, James, I thought, would be a great person to have on board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4638s">01:17:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that we talked about is, it's really important to us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4642s">01:17:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is we have qualifications of character, and as I've mentioned it to you already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4646s">01:17:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the things that you've mentioned in the confirmation, we've talked to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4652s">01:17:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">James is more aware of it, nothing that you've brought up has surprised us because we knew it already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4658s">01:17:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And James is the first person to know throughout the years that I've talked with him, met with him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4662s">01:17:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the primary thing that we've talked about all these years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4665s">01:17:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we weren't confident that there has been progress and this is not going to be a hindrance, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4671s">01:17:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we all have flaws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4673s">01:17:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And nobody, like, perfectly above reproach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4676s">01:17:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We all have flaws that, by the grace of God, covers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4680s">01:18:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we want somebody who's going to be able to not only just kind of go along with whatever we're doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4686s">01:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but who's going to be able to speak up and say, "Hey, I'm not sure if I see that in Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4689s">01:18:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. I'm not sure if that's a doctrinal position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4693s">01:18:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if that person is the right person for that position."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4696s">01:18:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so James would be a great person to add for that purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4701s">01:18:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, along with all the other qualifications,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4707s">01:18:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to make sure that this

it's in the context of where, even in disagreements, it's a disagreement between brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4723s">01:18:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4729s">01:18:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the day, we're brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4731s">01:18:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a fight between brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4733s">01:18:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are often times where we're in the meeting and we'll have sharp disagreements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4738s">01:18:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes, you know, if I disagree with something, my voice naturally elevates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4742s">01:19:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, and same thing with James, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4745s">01:19:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, our voices tend to elevate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4747s">01:19:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But we want to make sure that when these things happen, when we're struggling and fighting together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4751s">01:19:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's in the context of

href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4783s">01:19:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's something that, again, I'm encouraged with James.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4787s">01:19:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">James loves the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4789s">01:19:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He would pack up his bag and do something else before he does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4793s">01:19:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm confident that he loves the church sacrificially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4796s">01:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, those are qualifications beyond what I see in scripture that we want to make sure that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4802s">01:20:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's the reason why we started this process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4806s">01:20:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you know, we're trying to find wisdom in how to best involve you as a church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4810s">01:20:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we're not just saying, "Hey, just trust us. We're smart."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4813s">01:20:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we prayed about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4815s">01:20:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, we're going to take this time until the confirmation, until February or March,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4820s">01:20:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from now until then, if you really feel that these are things that I think are going to disqualify him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4827s">01:20:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the time. That's the time to bring it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4830s">01:20:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, we're hoping that sometime early next year, we'll have a confirmation installation service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4836s">01:20:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4837s">01:20:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Thanks, James.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4839s">01:20:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can breathe. You can breathe. Take off your tie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4842s">01:20:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">[Applause]</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4845s">01:20:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">[Applause]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4849s">01:20:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4850s">01:20:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, one of the things, okay, you guys can head down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4854s">01:20:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, one of the things that I asked, even before I even asked James, was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4860s">01:21:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and Diane doesn't even know, but I was, I actually kind of talked to Diane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4864s">01:21:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Diane doesn't know that I was actually poking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4866s">01:21:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And to see what kind of influence James was having at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4871s">01:21:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if Diane said at that time, and Diane had no idea that I was thinking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4875s">01:21:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If Diane said at that time, it's like, man, you know, I'm having a hard time with James at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4879s">01:21:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a hard time respecting him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4881s">01:21:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If he just kind of said that, you know, I probably would have pulled back and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4885s">01:21:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to have to wait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4887s">01:21:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But Diane's answer is like, man, like, I really respect James.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4890s">01:21:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And she's been, like, spiritually impacted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4893s">01:21:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, again, Esther knows, Esther, you know, when she was meeting up with Diane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4898s">01:21:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can all confirm that his public life and home life is consistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4904s">01:21:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's part of the reason why I felt comfortable proceeding and asking him to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4909s">01:21:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, but now I'm asking you guys to take the initiative if there is something that you really feel concerned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4915s">01:21:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because not simply because you have something against him, but because you love the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4920s">01:22:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to protect the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4921s">01:22:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to establish the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4922s">01:22:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we need, we're asking you if there are certain things, just take that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4926s">01:22:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Email, we'll meet with you in private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4929s">01:22:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if there are certain things that we need to hear or talk to you about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4932s">01:22:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or talk to you about, we'll take some time to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/299618987#t=4934s">01:22:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">before we move on to the next part, okay?</span></div></div></body></html>
