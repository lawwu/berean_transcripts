class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=46s">00:00:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that you can kind of identify with who I'm talking about because again, scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=51s">00:00:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">says there is no temptation common to

to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=109s">00:01:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">unbeliever, had become very self-destructive in his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=116s">00:01:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of that was due to the fact that he was really enslaved to alcohol, and this was starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=120s">00:02:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to come out more and more in his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=122s">00:02:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">He was able to hide it for a while, but of course anybody that's enslaved to alcohol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=126s">00:02:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll begin to show over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=129s">00:02:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it had an impact in his life, in his marriage, at his workplace, and all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=136s">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=137s">00:02:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so over time, it became evident that when Polly came to me for help, what was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=144s">00:02:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">going on, what is kind of a common thing that women will do, is they look for a way of escape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=150s">00:02:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do you think she tried to ask me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=151s">00:02:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think she really wanted help for her bitterness, or do you think she wanted help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=155s">00:02:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to find out if she had grounds for divorce?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=157s">00:02:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think?</span></div><div

know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=174s">00:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, sure, she's struggling with bitterness, no doubt, but she's also a sufferer, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=181s">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you've got to have compassion for people like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=184s">00:03:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And in an effort to just kind of minister to her soul, I just said, "Hey, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=191s">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just meet

what God's Word has to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=197s">00:03:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just allow the Spirit to do a work, and allow me to be sort of your stretcher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=202s">00:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bearer, you

href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=223s">00:03:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's difficult when a person, especially a believer, I would say, finds herself bitter.</span></div><div

us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=246s">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you think about it, I mean, just think of a bitter person right now that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=249s">00:04:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you might know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=250s">00:04:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Just think of how much trouble their life is, because it's just so heart

many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=262s">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can imagine that when someone is stuck in bitterness, the consequences of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/335053347#t=267s">00:04:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I know of churches that have
