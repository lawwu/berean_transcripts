class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=112">00:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so "therefore," whenever you see that in the Bible, is very significant because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=116">00:01:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's connecting or concluding a thought that was started in the previous chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=122">00:02:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But this "therefore" is not just any

which is the immediate context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=130">00:02:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it really is a connection to all of 11 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=134">00:02:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a big shift that happens between chapter 11 and chapter 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=139">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens in chapter 12 to chapter 13 is a conclusion of what he's been saying in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=144">00:02:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the 11 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=146">00:02:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, all the things that we have said, this is the conclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=151">00:02:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're moving from indicatives to imperatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=154">00:02:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the main emphasis in chapter 12 and 13 is considering who Jesus is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=159">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If he is truly superior over everything else in this world, what should that look like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=164">00:02:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the life of a

only just for the next few sermons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=172">00:02:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but again, into the imperatives where he's going to give us instructions on what a Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=178">00:02:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">life

it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=216">00:03:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh, you know, we don't want to get into

href="https://www.vimeo.com/541432229&t=228">00:03:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, keep that in the seminary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
