As we continue to reflect upon this week and just again, the various aspects of what Christ has accomplished, we're so thankful for everything that Christ has done. Thank you Adam for sharing how the Lord has been good to you with us. At this time, let's take a moment to turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 26, verses 14 through 19. Matthew 26, verses 14 through 19. Today is called Silent Wednesday and here we see a narrative of what Judas did during this day. Let's take a moment to read this passage, Matthew 16, verses 14 through 19. And it says, "Then one of the twelve named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priest and said, 'What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?' And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus. Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' And he said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I am to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' The disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they prepared the Passover." Real briefly, I want to review the various events of the Passion Week using the graphic that our media team shared. That on Saturday of the week, they came to Bethany and they stayed over at Mary, Martha and Lazarus' house. And the thing about it is, by this time, anywhere Jesus went, there was already a crowd. There was already a massive crowd and because Lazarus had been raised from the dead, there is just this massive amount of people that are trying to always see Jesus. That always upset the Pharisees and the religious leaders of the day. On Sunday, Jesus enters into Jerusalem and saying there is masses of people is an understatement. There are hordes of people praising him with palm branches saying, "Hosanna, Hosanna," which essentially means, "Save us, save us, O son of David." And so, that also upset the religious leaders of the time to the degree they were commanding Jesus, "Make them stop." And then on Monday, Jesus went into the temple and cleared it, disrupting the corrupt economy of the temple, essentially marketplace. That sure upset the religious leaders of the time. Just like we reviewed yesterday, Jesus went head to head in heated debates, saying parables and describing specific depictions and the Pharisees and the religious leaders knew that Jesus was talking about them. And so, that upset the religious leaders even more. Essentially, what we see as things are developing is there is a ramping up of the hatred of Christ and Pastor Nate eloquently said yesterday night that there was murderous intent by this time. Already, they wanted him to either be quiet, be disproved, or completely thrown off or seen as a fake, but by this time, they just wanted to eliminate him. And what you have essentially, Judas, I think that Judas was one that was paying attention to all that was going on. You see, perhaps some of the other disciples, maybe Peter might have been thinking, "Yeah, Jesus, you stick to him," right? Because there are a lot of Jews who wanted Jesus to be a revolutionary. And perhaps there was a lot of people who were already in the community had angst towards the already established system. Clearly, they had angst towards the ruling power, right? Maybe the sons of thunder, right? They're like, "Yeah, bring it down." Every time he went head to head in a debate, maybe they were just sitting there pumping their fists and going, "Ooh, that's right, burn," you know? And they were just egging him on. I think perhaps Judas was sitting there like this crazy guy. He told us he was going to die, but look at him, flipping tables, challenging the authorities. These high priests, these scribes, these Pharisees and Sadducees, they had temple officers. They had security guards. They had soldiers of their own. A lot of times, they enacted capital punishment when they felt that certain crimes fit the bill. Judas is sitting here like, "This guy is nuts. He's probably going to die." Why? Because sometimes, mistakenly, people say the disciples didn't really get it. They didn't really know that Jesus was going to go to the cross. No, actually, starting from Matthew 16, and even prior to then, Jesus was already both hinting and then explicitly told them, "I am going to suffer." For example, Matthew 16, 21 through 22 says, "From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things from the elders and chief priests, and be killed and be raised up on the third day. That's when Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'God forbid it. Lord, this shall never happen to you.'" The disciples knew, they just didn't like the idea. Another example, Matthew 17, 22, 23, "And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. He will be raised on the third day.' And they were deeply grieved." So fact. Not only in these instances, but you can count about five instances where Jesus was explicitly clear. Prior to that, Jesus also hinted, "The Son of Man must be lifted. Son of Man must suffer." There were enough pre-disclosures, so to speak, that the disciples should have known if they were paying attention. But the fact of the matter is, they were just wondering, "Huh? Is that a good idea?" They just didn't like it. Judas essentially then understood Jesus' statements. He understood, you know, point 1A. He just did not also understand point 1B. In his eyes, he was thinking, "Oh my goodness, this rabbi of ours, this lord and master of ours is going to get us killed." It's probably what he was thinking. Jesus is going to get himself killed and us along with him. I believe Judas was a calculating man. He was the individual who was taking care of the money bag for the group. He was the man, do you remember, when the lady came, broke the alabaster, and was anointing Jesus? And Judas said, "What a waste! You know that could have been sold?" For the poor, of course, right? He was a quick calculating man who understood Jesus was going to get himself killed. And so, as an opportunist, he decides to get in on the game. If Jesus is going to be killed by the Pharisees, then at least I'm going to benefit from it. What I found very interesting was that I just always assumed that the scribes and Pharisees were looking for an opportunity to kill Jesus, so they kind of egged on one of the disciples, right? Maybe one of the Pharisees came along and said, "Come here. Let me give you some money," or something like that. Some deal went down. After reviewing the details of this passage, notice how in this passage in Matthew 26, verse 14, it says that Judas actually went and asked this question of them, "What are you willing to give me?" And Judas at this point didn't even have a plan yet. But what he was doing was he was working with both the Pharisees and the temple officers, those soldiers I was talking about, to devise a plan from that time. And I thought this was really interesting because at that moment then, Judas didn't even have everything planned out. And as a matter of fact, he, in my eyes, didn't even add that much to the plan. Do you ever think about that? What did Judas add to the plan of betraying Christ? I mean, you could readily see where Jesus was. There was a crowd following him. And then I realized this is the only thing, essentially, Judas was adding to the betrayal and the scheme. The Pharisees, because of their fear of man, wanted to find Jesus in a secluded moment. They wanted to avoid the crowds. And so, here in this passage, if you take a look in Luke 22, verse 3 through 6, it says, "Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve. And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. They were glad and agreed with him money. So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd." Do you see that? I'm highlighting these aspects of the story because we're taking a look at Judas and his perspective. And to me, what's really interesting about all this is there was such a greed in Judas' heart that I believe Satan seized that, entered into him, and played on him. Now just as a quick side note, the story is quite crazy because we recognize that everything that is happening is absolutely according to the timetable of God. God is so sovereign that everything is falling into place and the Scripture is being fulfilled. Nevertheless, Satan is also entering into Judas, fulfilling his schemes and his devices. But also, Judas himself is a foolish, greedy man, seizing the opportunity. You see everything in play. And what Judas is doing is he is trying to, I think, make up perhaps for some lost time. If Jesus is going to go out, at least I'm going to recoup a little bit of money. What's really crazy about this is the passage in Matthew says that they offer, when he asked, "How much will you give me?" They offered 30 pieces of silver. When I reviewed that, I was like, "Wait a minute. It's not even gold, right? This guy's nuts." Thirty pieces of silver in that time would be worth about five weeks' wage, they say. It's a month wage. A Lord, a rabbi, a master, even to this individual, walking with him for three years, and yet for a single month's wage, he'd be willing to say, "Deal. I consent." This is a greedy individual. And what I like to say this, when an individual gives into one's greed, it makes the individual absolutely foolish. The plan is so foolish, Jesus himself calls it foolish. The plan is so foolish, when you read it, you kind of wonder, truly, Judas didn't even add much to the entire scheme of things. As a matter of fact, in this passage I want to highlight for you in Matthew 26, verse 55 through 56, it says, "At that time, Jesus said to the crowds who had gathered," so this, right now, what I'm reading is when the people actually try to come and seize Jesus. He asked this question, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as you would against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place to fulfill the scriptures of the prophets. Then all the disciples left him and fled." Jesus is essentially saying, "This is dumb. I was with you every single day. You had to scheme, trying to catch me." And then the funny thing about it is they're trying to avoid a crowd, but there was already a crowd. Jesus was speaking to the crowd there. But essentially, when I think about this, I think about as a reflection and meditation, there is such a greed in Judas' heart that we can reflect on. To ask the question, if we are tempted with this, I guess, expectation of what is Jesus going to avail to me, what kind of benefit, or perhaps if Satan would tempt us with this kind of complaint, this is a waste of time. Or perhaps the angst and frustration that perhaps we live in this day, where Satan puts these foolish words into our head, where we start to complain and say, "I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I'm tired of going town to town. I'm tired of asking. I'm tired of going through the village and having to pick up the leftover grain." Those kinds of sentiments, what does that reveal? I think those kind of sentiments are the sentiments essentially pervasive in this generation. And so I want to give you this question. When Judas is tempted with this betrayal, this disloyalty, I wonder if his reason and rationale for him following Jesus in the first place is actually the exact same reason why he is betraying him now. If Judas thought like the rest of the disciples, "Hey, Jesus, look at you. Look at the crowds on our side. Look at all the people. You've got number on your side. So now tell us who's going to be on your right and left." I'm pretty sure Judas was also listening. "Yes, Jesus, tell us who is going to be on your right and left." And so what's really interesting about this is with Judas' greed and his looking to Christ for some kind of benefit, even if at least you're going to gain me this 30 shekels, 30 silver, I mean, that is a horrible, horrible sentiment. But what I liken it to is somebody who has Jesus in their garage. What do I mean? I believe one of the grave sins of this generation is a lot of time people like holding onto Christ as something of value, valuable enough that I can't throw him away. They'll like to have him in his garage just in case we need him, but when the opportune time comes, we might have a garage sale because at least if I sell it, then I'll have some money. What's really crazy about all this, again, is we can reflect on lots of different things. Oh my gosh, incredible amounts of vanity that Judas would walk with Jesus for so long and be able to betray him in that moment. But in the end, when greed takes control of the heart, we will do all kinds of heinous things. And so as a reflection and challenge to us, I want to ask you, do you have any of these discontent, disappointed sentiments, perhaps even a grumbling complaint against Christ? "Lord, what have you done for me though? Why aren't you helping me though?" If that is the case, we have to be very careful, amen? Now what I would like to highlight by way of closing thought is not so much Judas because there is still nevertheless Jesus who is exhibiting incredible amounts of composure. What I'm trying to say is today, although it is Silent Wednesday, let us not just simply think about Judas the sinner, the betrayer, one who is, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, it must have been better for you not to have been born because woe is the one who would betray the son of God." But let's actually focus on the son of God who is to be appreciated for his incredible composure. When I think about the events leading up to this week, I mean, I think about like Jesus knowing what he knows in terms of what is filled in the heart of man. Jesus knew all along that there would be a betrayer. Jesus knows when people are asking him questions, "Tell us, Jesus. Show us a sign, Jesus." He knows what is contained in the heart of all those who would ask him and accuse him. When he is walking into the city in Jerusalem, all these individuals praising him and giving him branches, he knows what's in their heart. When he is debating, when he is engaged in all the teaching and the debates and the fierce combats with the scribes of the day, he knows what's in their hearts. And while Judas thinks he's secretly going and making a deal, is Jesus not aware? Jesus is absolutely aware. Tomorrow during the Passover, Jesus calls it out, "He whose hand is on the table with me will betray me." And all the disciples are like, "Dude, not me. Not me." Right? And he could have easily said, "And you will deny me and you will run and you will..." But the composure. So when I reflect on the passages when Jesus says, "I did not come to judge," every single step of the way, I'm sitting there thinking, "Thank you, Lord, because if I were you, I would sit there and call out every single person. You liar. You two-faced." Right? And then even here, to be aware that Judas is doing this and then has the audacity come with the rest of the disciples to share in the meal where Jesus is instituting the new covenant and he's explaining to them, "This is my body broken, my blood shed for you." Can you imagine? I can't imagine that. I can't imagine like sometimes you put yourself in the shoes thinking that this is the bread broken for you and you would just look and be like, "Not you." Right? And then you just move on. We thank the Lord. Lord, thank you that you did not come first to judge, but you came first to show mercy. And so scripture talks about the greatness of Christ. First Peter chapter 2, verse 21 through 24, it says, "For you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth. While being reviled, he did not revile in return. While suffering, he uttered no threats." And then I would add, "While being betrayed." Right? "While being betrayed, he did not react, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously. And he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. For by his wounds, you were healed." Amen. Let us continue to reflect and recognize when Christ entered into that scene and was going to the cross, the scene is horrific because there's just so much corruption, waywardness, and sin around him. And what would feel natural if you put yourself in his shoes would be, "You should just judge all of them right now." And so we praise Christ and we pray in appreciation. What great composure, what great dedication to fulfill your merciful, saving grace. Let's take time now to pray. Would you take a moment to examine your heart? Is there any greedy expectation? Is there any grumbling complaint upon Christ, disappointment in your heart? But also let's quickly turn that around to say to the Lord, "God, we appreciate every aspect of what you've done, even making sure that you walk through all of these necessary steps so that the scripture would be fulfilled, but that your mercy would be fulfilled upon the cross." Let's take some time to pray.</p></div></body></html>
