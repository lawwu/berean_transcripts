people regularly hold up their Bible and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=90s">00:01:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"This is the word of

the scriptures and how they approach it, it is very far from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=100s">00:01:40.080</a></span> | <span

intended meaning of the passage, then all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=125s">00:02:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you have is conjecture, opinion, and this and that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=129s">00:02:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's more, we obviously have to apply accurately by making sure that we go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=134s">00:02:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the right

only then do you ask historical theology, you know, systematic and then, or systematic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=142s">00:02:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">historical and philosophical, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=144s">00:02:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole idea there is, in terms of even the way that you're going to now place it</span></div><div

couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=170s">00:02:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">times so you guys can follow along, okay?</span></div><div

stands in opposition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=195s">00:03:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to what's normal, right?</span></div><div

church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=202s">00:03:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And absolutely, absolutely.</span></div><div

these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=211s">00:03:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">core doctrines that really stand as pillars for the

inspiring and like a, "Ah, guys, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=223s">00:03:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">do it," kind of day, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=226s">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's a sense in which we can talk about, again, this view of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=229s">00:03:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We can talk about view of his

href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=235s">00:03:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a sense in which it can remain theoretical, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=242s">00:04:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today we're going to be challenged to hear this admonition that we must align</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=248s">00:04:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ourselves to his purposes then, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=254s">00:04:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever God is doing then through his word, whatever God is doing then through his church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=260s">00:04:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to align ourselves with his purposes, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=265s">00:04:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not enough to say the one thing, well, first of all, it's definitely not enough and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=269s">00:04:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely wrong to have a misconstrued view of what God is doing so that the major problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=275s">00:04:35.480</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=280s">00:04:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=281s">00:04:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And people have been making the Bible say what they want it to say, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=286s">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the admonition that I'm saying is, if we're going to go down this line of saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=290s">00:04:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">well, God is holy and that's accurately what we see him as, then you need to submit to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=295s">00:04:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=296s">00:04:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If God's word is God's word and you have a high view of it, then you need to submit to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=300s">00:05:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">his word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=301s">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If God's church is cherished and it has authority, then we need to function underneath that as</span></div><div

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=320s">00:05:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we're going to be talking about

purpose statement for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/193979787#t=328s">00:05:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">life is really
