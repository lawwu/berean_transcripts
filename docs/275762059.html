a bit more clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=214s">00:03:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is my third time going through

ago, but I gave a sermon on it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=223s">00:03:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">then the third time going through it, that's really trying to come through the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=226s">00:03:46.300</a></span> | <span

I'll know what to highlight and what not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=232s">00:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight in certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=234s">00:03:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But it has become a lot more clear to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=236s">00:03:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has made the cross, even this third time, made the cross that much more valuable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=242s">00:04:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because we see the work behind every intricate detail what God was doing in the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=250s">00:04:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Leviticus is a study of a shadow of the gospel that is ultimately fulfilled in Christ as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=254s">00:04:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it says in Colossians 2, 16 and 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=257s">00:04:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was ultimately to point to the reality that was going to be found in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=263s">00:04:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously you can study about the gospel and who Jesus is and salvation just by studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=268s">00:04:28.740</a></span> | <span

the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=286s">00:04:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">benefit of being a Jew was this was embedded into their

in the book of Leviticus, and a lot of the stuff that we probably even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=324s">00:05:24.720</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/275762059#t=330s">00:05:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">very specific that we know about the cross in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
