be much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=9s">00:00:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">more confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span

says, "We can understand God if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=29s">00:00:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">don't really need to have this

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=119s">00:01:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, just want to really encourage you to commit to the study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=124s">00:02:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can personally say that of all the books that I've studied personally, Leviticus, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=133s">00:02:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was one of the books that I've probably benefited from the most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=136s">00:02:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Partially it's because I knew so little about it before I studied it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=139s">00:02:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I did study it, I realized just how crucial it was to my understanding of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=144s">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all the rest of Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=145s">00:02:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guarantee you, if you didn't know the content of Leviticus and you studied and committed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=151s">00:02:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with us from now until we finished the book of Leviticus, I guarantee you, you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=155s">00:02:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to come out of it thinking, "Wow, I really did not fully grasp the gospel until I came,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=161s">00:02:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or at least you had a very superficial understanding of it until you began to understand the content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=167s">00:02:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of Leviticus, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=168s">00:02:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't emphasize enough how important this book is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=170s">00:02:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, in the Jewish synagogue, the very first book that was taught any child was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=177s">00:02:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=180s">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it was that important to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=181s">00:03:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So today, for the New Testament church, we typically say, "What book should we study?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=186s">00:03:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a brand new Christian, probably the Gospel of John is the first one that somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=191s">00:03:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">would recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=192s">00:03:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to really dive in and really understand the gospel, we would recommend the book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=197s">00:03:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans to really go and dissect that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=199s">00:03:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you understand the book of Romans, you'll say you understand what God has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=202s">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=203s">00:03:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In the Old Testament, if you were to pick a book to understand God and what He is doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=208s">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=209s">00:03:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So many commentators will call Leviticus the Romans of the Old Testament, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=215s">00:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So considering how important it is to have very little knowledge of its significance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=220s">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and its meaning, again, it means that there's a big gaping hole of our understanding of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=225s">00:03:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God and what He's doing in the Old Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=228s">00:03:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, so I can't emphasize enough how important this is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=232s">00:03:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as some logistics, just to kind of give you a heads up, obviously I'm headed out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=237s">00:03:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">India this Friday, so I won't be here next Wednesday, but Pastor Mark will be here teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=244s">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He won't be teaching specifically in a text, but just covering over the subject of holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=250s">00:04:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the Bible study will continue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=253s">00:04:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we will not have a break next week, so Pastor Mark is going to cover for me until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=256s">00:04:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=257s">00:04:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I do come back, we'll jump into the text chapter one, two, and three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=260s">00:04:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the homework will be given to you at the end of the session, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=265s">00:04:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing is after my teaching, a quick overview of the book of Leviticus, we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=272s">00:04:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to break you guys into small groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=274s">00:04:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So Pastor Mark has assignments, the group assignments, and he's going to post it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=279s">00:04:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=280s">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that way the small group leaders know who's in their group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=283s">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to have you guys look for your small group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

things that we wanted to address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=304s">00:05:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the coming year is we want to

back, but for whatever the reason, we stopped doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=314s">00:05:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But once a month, about once a month, instead of our normal Wednesday Bible study, weekday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=318s">00:05:18.760</a></span> |

the whole church, this is our group, the college group, and the youth group, once a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/251226358#t=326s">00:05:26.400</a></span>
