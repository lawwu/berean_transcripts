time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2686s">00:44:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so giving them eyeglasses is kind of like giving them sight for the first time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2689s">00:44:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2691s">00:44:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And also we have a wound care team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2692s">00:44:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So our nurses and PAs, a few of them are coming to help us with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2697s">00:44:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have a VBS team who's running games with these children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2700s">00:45:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, some of you guys who've been with us know exactly what it's like, but VBS here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2705s">00:45:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is kind of like one of many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2706s">00:45:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, when our kids were young, we probably went to like five or six VBSs in the summer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2711s">00:45:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's abundant and it's free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2713s">00:45:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But over there, any activity with children, especially in the poor villages, it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2717s">00:45:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">first time ever running games and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2719s">00:45:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So they love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2720s">00:45:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good way for us to kind of bring the gospel into the villages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2724s">00:45:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our team is headed out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2726s">00:45:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And every year I get asked, how long are we going to do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2730s">00:45:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the persecution in India is ramping up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2733s">00:45:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like right now, and I shared this before, when we first started going in, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2737s">00:45:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the persecution meter, India was ranked maybe like 32 or 33.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2743s">00:45:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It climbed up to number 11, meaning right under Syria, North Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2748s">00:45:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's gotten up there and it's actually moving up pretty fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2751s">00:45:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the reason why is because the government for the whole nation of India came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2757s">00:45:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">from a very militant Hindu party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2760s">00:46:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though on paper it's illegal to persecute Christians, when they do that, nothing happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2765s">00:46:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't get arrested, they don't go to jail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2767s">00:46:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So they become more emboldened through the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2769s">00:46:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're doing a lot of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2771s">00:46:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, about four months ago, they targeted an Australian missionary and his kids, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2777s">00:46:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is pretty big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2778s">00:46:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's one thing to hurt the locals, but if you hurt a missionary, it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2782s">00:46:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">be an international thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2783s">00:46:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's how emboldened they're becoming over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2786s">00:46:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So people ask all the time, like, you know, how long can we go to India because of safety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2792s">00:46:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">issues?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2793s">00:46:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2794s">00:46:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Every year we come back, we think like we're going to have to evaluate the next year, see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2797s">00:46:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2799s">00:46:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But the work in India, it is so crystal clear that the fruit that it bears when we do go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2806s">00:46:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that we believe that it's worth the discomfort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2809s">00:46:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not going to call it anything more than a discomfort, because it's just discomfort,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2813s">00:46:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're only there for a short period and we're back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2815s">00:46:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like we're risking our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2818s">00:46:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because we're weak sauce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2820s">00:47:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We live in Orange County, so we're not used to people even say, "You're a Christian?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2824s">00:47:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Persecution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2825s">00:47:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2826s">00:47:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're from here going over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2829s">00:47:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So in comparison, it seems like we're doing hard work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2833s">00:47:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But in reality, it's the pastors there that we want to support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2836s">00:47:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to let them know that we have a church here praying for them and supporting them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2840s">00:47:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to do what we can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2841s">00:47:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm very thankful for all the people who are going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

where we're at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/311802539#t=2858s">00:47:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you guys can take some time to pray for them.</span></div></div></body></html>
