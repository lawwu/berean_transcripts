Father, you worked your will. I had no righteousness of my own. I had no right to draw near your throne. But Father, you loved me still. And in love before you lay the world's foundation, you breathed death into a dark me as your own. You have raised me up so high above my station. I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone. You left your home to seek out the lost. You knew the great and terrible cost. But Jesus, your face was set. I worked my fingers down to the bone. Nothing I did would ever return.                Hey, class of 2020. Roger here. By God's grace, you made it this far and you graduated. And if some of you aren't graduating yet, don't be anxious about it. Before this, you were adults. And now you're really adults. But don't worry. God has been faithful and he will continue to be. Congrats, class of 2020. I know that it's been a little bit rough for you guys, but I just wanted to let you know that we're still thinking of you. We're praying for you. We love you guys so much and we're so proud. Hey, class of 2020. Just your class of 2017 ladies here. And we just want to send a little word of encouragement and congrats to you guys as you move forward into your post-grad life. So here's a verse, Philippians 1, verse 9. "And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment." "So that you may approve what is excellent and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ." "Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God." And I hope that this verse would be an encouragement to you guys as you move into post-grad. And it is also our prayer for you as you move forward past this really big milestone. And 1, 2, 3. Congratulations, class of 2020. Class of 2020, congratulations on graduating. It's a bummer we can't come support you guys in person. But just know that we really look forward to seeing you all in band.

I'm definitely glad to have been able to catch up with you guys every time we go back down to Irvine. I'm definitely encouraged to hear of your love for the Lord and the impact that you guys have all made on the Breen College ministry as well as Breen in general. I wish we could be there to give you guys your version of this sign. What's up, class of 2020? It's John here. I just wanted to say congratulations to all of you. And you guys have worked hard and just stayed faithful during these four years of ministry in college. Even though I may not know all of you, I just wanted to give you all a special gift here in my pocket. Let me just get it. Oh, Hi, class of 2020. I just want to quickly thank you guys for your kindness and graciousness towards our class and even for help in some of my school classes. I will continue to pray for spiritual growth and that God will be faithful to answer. I just want to quickly show you guys how bright your future is. Hey, class of 2020. I just want to congratulate you guys on just this past four years of just making through the school. I just want to say that I'm really encouraged of how you guys have been growing spiritually in church as well as just your relationship with the Lord. I just want to encourage you to trust in the Lord during these tough times as well. Congratulations, class of 2020 on graduating. I'm thankful to have gotten to know you guys and to see many of you guys grow. I pray that you continue to seek the Lord wherever he takes you, and we all can see you once again. Hey, class of 2020. This is your seniors. Even though you weren't able to have a real graduation, we're all super proud of you. It's been great to be able to see the amount of growth and maturation that has been happening over the past three years. So from us to you, we all want to encourage you to continue running the race together. Just here's a couple of verses for encouragement from Hebrews 12, 1 to 2. "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God." Yay! Yay, congrats! Congrats!</p></div></body></html>
