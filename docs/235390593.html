Just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=62s">00:01:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">starting last week, we talked about how chapter 11 ends with the seventh trumpet and there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=67s">00:01:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a it's not a pause, but chapter 12 through 15. It kind of gives us a setup for the real severe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=75s">00:01:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">judgment that's coming in chapter 16, the bold judgments. So the bold judgments are the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=80s">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">severest out of the seven different segments of judgments that we've had. In chapter 10 and 11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=90s">00:01:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it talks about the three woes. The two woes have already been spoken and the worst of the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=94s">00:01:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">woes is waiting for us in chapter 16. So chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15 is kind of a setup to explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=102s">00:01:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all that's going to happen in chapter 16. So is chapter 12 through 14, 15, was that meant to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=109s">00:01:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">taken completely chronologically? Is it kind of telling us chapter 12 happened, chapter 13 happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=114s">00:01:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter 14 happened? Is that how we're supposed to read that? No, we talked about that last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=120s">00:02:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it's not what's happening, what's unraveling for us is talking about human history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=126s">00:02:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">redemptive history as a whole. So there are some elements of it that's talking about the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=131s">00:02:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some elements that's talking about the creation and the fall. There's some elements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=135s">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about Israel's history. So when you read it, you can't just simply read it chronologically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=140s">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand? Okay, so if you try to read it chronologically, it's not going to make sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=144s">00:02:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's just not going to fit. So it's not meant to be read that way. In fact, as we study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=148s">00:02:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it, you're going to see what I'm saying if you don't know what I'm saying now. Okay, so chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=152s">00:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">12, the setup was this conflict between this woman and the dragon. Who do we say the woman was?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=158s">00:02:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, most likely talking about Israel. There's certain language there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=163s">00:02:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that probably it's not. In fact, most commentators don't believe that this is talking about Mary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=168s">00:02:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's talking about probably, again, it's not 100%, but an educated guess as it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=173s">00:02:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">referenced to Israel giving birth to the Messiah. So the Messiah clearly is Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=178s">00:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So the conflict is between Jesus and who?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=181s">00:03:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The dragon, right? And who's the dragon?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=191s">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the dragon the Antichrist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=192s">00:03:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some response. Is the dragon the Antichrist? No, he's not the Antichrist. Who is the dragon?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=202s">00:03:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan himself, right? So he's the dragon is Satan himself. So we learned last week that Satan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=212s">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because of his rebellion against God, he gets kicked out of heaven. He takes a third of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=217s">00:03:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stars with him and the stars represent what? The angels. So the fallen angels, a third of them are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=223s">00:03:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">taken with him. And then there is this conflict between the dragon and his angels and who else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=229s">00:03:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Archangel Michael, right? Archangel Michael and the other angels versus the dragon and his angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=238s">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this conflict happens, right? And Archangel Michael wins. So this is not like, oh, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=245s">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what happened. And so therefore, you know, this is when this happened. So you can't read it like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=250s">00:04:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that. This is just kind of telling us in redemptive history in totality that this is what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=255s">00:04:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So we go to chapter 13 and he's referring to two separate beasts, right? And so we're going to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=262s">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">out the identity of these beasts and who they are and what they are doing and what purpose they serve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=267s">00:04:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully we'll gain some insight as to what is happening here. Okay. So let's look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=273s">00:04:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">first one, the first beast. All right. So the first beast, the identity of the first beast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=291s">00:04:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">First, we want to clarify that the beast is not the dragon, but a servant of the dragon, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=299s">00:04:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The beast is not the dragon, but the servant of the dragon. In verse four, it says, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=303s">00:05:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">worship the dragon for he had given authority to the beast. So they're distinct, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=308s">00:05:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the beast and a dragon are two separate entities. The first beast represents a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=317s">00:05:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and it is also symbolic of a demonic kingdom. So if you look at the language, there's clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=323s">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">reference to the beast as being an individual, a particular person. But if you look at the details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=330s">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of this description, he's talking about the 10 horns and seven heads, all in reference to authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=335s">00:05:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It is also symbolic of a kingdom. So the reference to the beast is in reference to his kingdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=343s">00:05:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the personhood, both at the same time. And it's hard to separate the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=352s">00:05:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The first piece is most likely in reference to what we often call the Antichrist, mentioned in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=358s">00:05:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">other places in the Bible. I didn't mention it here, but in the Old Testament, there are passages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=363s">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">where they called son of Belial or daughter of Belial or Belial himself. And the reference to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=369s">00:06:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Belial oftentimes is in reference to or similar in reference to the Antichrist in the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=375s">00:06:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I have some. So the various verses, and I could have chosen a bunch of them, but these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=382s">00:06:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the verses that we have in 1 John 2, 18 says, "Children, it is the last hour. And as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=388s">00:06:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">have heard that Antichrist is coming, so now many Antichrists have come. Therefore, we know that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=393s">00:06:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is the last hour." So in John, he talks about Antichrist is coming, but many Antichrist has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=400s">00:06:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">already come. So the spirit of the Antichrist has already come, but there's a particular Antichrist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=406s">00:06:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the person himself. He hasn't fully been revealed, but the work of Antichrist through his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=413s">00:06:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">minions, it has already started from the time of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=416s">00:06:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Who is the liar, but he who denies that Jesus Christ, Jesus is the Christ. This is the Antichrist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=424s">00:07:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he who denies the Father and the Son." Again, the work of Antichrist is not simply at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=431s">00:07:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's already started. "Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=440s">00:07:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already." So in the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=445s">00:07:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">church, clearly from John's writings and Paul's writings and other epistles, that part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=452s">00:07:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">early church teaching was about the coming of Antichrist. So we typically think, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=457s">00:07:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">when Paul and Peter and John, when they went and preached the gospel, you know, they taught about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=462s">00:07:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, his identity, his death, his resurrection, and the church, and those are the main doctrines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=467s">00:07:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that we typically think that they probably spent 99% of the time talking about. But if you read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=472s">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the epistles carefully, you find that the talk of the end times was actually a very vital part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=480s">00:08:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gospel spreading. So remember when Paul went to Thessalonica, he was only there for about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=486s">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three Sundays, possibly a little bit longer than that, but during that period, a big chunk of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=493s">00:08:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">teaching was about the end times. So if you remember in 2 Thessalonians, he's talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=497s">00:08:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Remember when I told you that the man of lawlessness is going to come?" So the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=501s">00:08:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">short period weeks that he had, one of the main part of his teaching was about coming of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=507s">00:08:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Antichrist, and that's why he says, "Remember when I was with you, I taught you about these things."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=512s">00:08:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it's a reminder to us just how significant and important is this to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=517s">00:08:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual life, that from the very get-go that this was part of the teaching in the early church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=524s">00:08:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So they spread the gospel, but along with spreading the gospel, there was teaching about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=529s">00:08:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the spiritual warfare and Antichrist and what he's doing, right? Which makes sense. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=535s">00:08:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual children and you have demonic forces who are actively working to scheme and to destroy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=542s">00:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the church, you want to make sure that at least they know about it, they hear about it, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=547s">00:09:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what Paul does. Paul and the other apostles do. Second, John verse 7, "For many deceivers have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=555s">00:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=559s">00:09:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">one is a deceiver and the Antichrist." So again, most of these, if not all of these passages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=565s">00:09:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are about 1 John and 2 John, but we see teachings of this in Christ's teaching in the book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=571s">00:09:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Matthew.

The identity of the beast clearly is the Antichrist. So he's a servant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=607s">00:10:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of Satan, right? Description, how is he described in this passage? In contrast to the second beast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=614s">00:10:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that rises out of the earth, the first beast rises out of the sea, right? The significance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=619s">00:10:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of this, again, this is an educated guess and I think this was the best explanation that I read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=625s">00:10:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the commentaries, is that the contrast may be stating that the first beast is coming out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=632s">00:10:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sea and the second beast is coming out of where? The earth. And the contrast between the two is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=643s">00:10:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that the first is the Antichrist and we're going to talk a little bit more when we get to the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=647s">00:10:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">beast. The second beast is obviously distinct from the first beast, right? And the second beast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=653s">00:10:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is, it serves the, the second beast serves the first beast, okay?

So the more significant work is Satan is above the first beast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=669s">00:11:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the first beast is above the second beast. I'm getting confused, okay? Let me say that again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=676s">00:11:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan is, is the top, under him the servant is the Antichrist, the first beast, and then the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=684s">00:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">beast serves the first beast. You get that? Okay? So here he identifies and says that the first beast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=692s">00:11:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming out of the sea and then later on if you read the, the coming of the second beast in verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=697s">00:11:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">11 he says he's coming out from the earth and the best explanation I heard from that was to come out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=703s">00:11:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sea meaning that it came from a distant place, right?

He's not in their midst. That the Antichrist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=723s">00:12:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not the spirit of the Antichrist, but the, the Antichrist is going to come from somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=728s">00:12:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to come from afar, right? But the second beast is, which I'm going to explain a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=735s">00:12:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">later, is probably in reference to false, false prophets or maybe a false prophet and he's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=743s">00:12:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to be in the midst of them and I'll, again I'll explain a little bit later. So that's the distinction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=748s">00:12:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">between the first beast coming out of the sea and the second beast coming from the earth. Follow?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=754s">00:12:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so if you read it hopefully you know what I'm referencing to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=759s">00:12:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty clear that the beast is mimicking the dragon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=765s">00:12:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in his description it says he has 10 horns and 7 heads, right?

You have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=795s">00:13:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you have Satan and then the Antichrist and Antichrist is carrying out the work of the dragon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=803s">00:13:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay?

So basically blasphemy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/235390593#t=826s">00:13:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is anything that is defaming by word or action against the name of God.
