point to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=118s">00:01:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The Hebrew word that's translated leprosy in Leviticus

about the disease of leprosy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=131s">00:02:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It definitely includes that disease,

skin diseases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=139s">00:02:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now if you're from the medical community and you know all the facts and all the biological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=144s">00:02:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things that happens in leprosy, you may read all these things and maybe it would make more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=148s">00:02:28.280</a></span> | <span

are going to bleed in and we're not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=155s">00:02:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">able to tell the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=156s">00:02:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So just for our benefit, so that it would help us, I'm just going to be referring it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=161s">00:02:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to leprosy, but the term leprosy doesn't really cover all of the things that they're mentioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=168s">00:02:48.520</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=172s">00:02:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So they already acknowledge that it covers more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=175s">00:02:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But for our study, I'm just going to be referring to all of it as just leprosy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=184s">00:03:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So among the 61 defilements of ancient Jewish law that is mentioned in the Old

seriousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=194s">00:03:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could clearly see that in chapter 13 and 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=197s">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that they dealt with leprosy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=199s">00:03:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's any one particular disease that really stood out among other diseases, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=206s">00:03:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you caught this, it was the end to your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=209s">00:03:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Like today, I think when you hear the word cancer, that's the word that most people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=215s">00:03:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">afraid of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=216s">00:03:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You go to the doctor and they say it could be cancerous and automatically your heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=219s">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">drops because it leads to death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=222s">00:03:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well at that particular time, leprosy was cancerous and it was much more serious than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=229s">00:03:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer because of all the ramifications before it led to the death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=233s">00:03:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was pretty much the worst thing, worst news that you can get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=240s">00:04:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And leper wasn't allowed to come within six feet of any other human being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=246s">00:04:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't allowed to be near any

leprosy, you're not allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=252s">00:04:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to have any contact with other human beings, including your own family members, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=257s">00:04:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the moment you came into contact with them, they became unclean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=260s">00:04:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So it forced complete isolation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=265s">00:04:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This disease was considered so revolting that the leper wasn't permitted to come within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=272s">00:04:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">150 feet of anyone when

was any kind of wind, normally not even six feet, even among your family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=283s">00:04:43.620</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=289s">00:04:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">where you couldn't even hear them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=292s">00:04:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The Jewish custom said that you should not even greet a leper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=296s">00:04:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually this is not in scripture, but the Jewish community automatically equated that</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=306s">00:05:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if somebody has leprosy, it must be because they've been cursed by God, so they were treated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=311s">00:05:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">accordingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=315s">00:05:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So not only were they completely isolated, they were considered to be unclean, and they</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=321s">00:05:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And one rabbi actually bragged that he would not even buy an egg on a street where he saw</span></div><div

him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=332s">00:05:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just kind of gives you the prejudice and the kind of life a leper lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=336s">00:05:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about all the situations in the New

crying out to God, that the cultural circumstance behind that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=345s">00:05:45.400</a></span> | <span

it gives us kind of a better understanding of Jesus' interaction with the leper, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=352s">00:05:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">why that was so shocking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=355s">00:05:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody was so concerned that Jesus was hanging around with prostitutes and tax collectors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=360s">00:06:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but a leper among all of them would have been considered the filthiest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=365s">00:06:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they were shocked that Jesus was hanging around with tax collectors, imagine the shock</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=388s">00:06:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were so afraid of leprosy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

where you would have all kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/268241020#t=415s">00:06:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">boils and we're going to just
