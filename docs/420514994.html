Okay as we take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=160s">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">look at this passage, it is also again for an inductive study like this a little bit lengthy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=166s">00:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and so we should do an overview. Okay remember that this passage has for us a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=175s">00:02:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">application that's been building since the verse one of chapter four and so what we realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=181s">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually is this is a more specific application of the various principles we've learned already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=187s">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The principles that were found in verse 17 through 24 which told us to stop living like the Gentiles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=194s">00:03:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in both thinking and in desire and so it said to put off your old self but rather to put on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=200s">00:03:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to put on the things that we know are true of us. What's more in verses 7 through 16 there was lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of principles but essentially what God desired for us is that we would all attain to this unity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=214s">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially this unity would be the growing maturity to the measure and stature of Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=220s">00:03:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ so what he expected was that every single one of us in every single way would grow towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=226s">00:03:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ and in so doing we'd be responsible for ministry. We'd be growing closer and closer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=230s">00:03:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">together and what's more, previous to that remember in chapter one there is a walk worthy principle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=237s">00:03:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which essentially taught us to walk worthy of this incredible calling that we reviewed all the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=243s">00:04:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from chapter one through three and so the idea is this great incredible salvation we have, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=250s">00:04:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">great and incredible completeness that we have in Jesus Christ is supposed to now take effect in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=256s">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our walk. Okay, taking a look at this passage as an overview then there are very specific things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=262s">00:04:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">outlined for us in this passage. I have some blanks for you there on your packet just highlighting what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=268s">00:04:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're supposed to put off. The passage tells us to put off falsehood from our lives. It also tells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=275s">00:04:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us to not sin in our anger. Okay, to not let the sun go down on our anger so it deals with anger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=281s">00:04:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more, the passage teaches us to not steal anymore. Steal no longer. Right, it also tells us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=288s">00:04:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to put off unwholesome words that our speech needs to be careful and then also renewed so unwholesome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=297s">00:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">words put off. Okay, it also tells us to stop grieving the Holy Spirit so stop grieving and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=303s">00:05:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then it tells us to put aside everything related to bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, slander that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=309s">00:05:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all these things including malice must be put away. And so I have this outline for you as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=315s">00:05:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">overview that this passage has, you can count, six things that we need to be putting away and if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=322s">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">include all the various things included in the letter F that's actually a lot of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=327s">00:05:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, as you can see there's a lot to cover in this passage and we're not going to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=332s">00:05:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">dive into each one fully in just the hour that we have but again for us it's up to us to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=339s">00:05:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're asking the right questions. What does that mean then? And if we're supposed to be putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=344s">00:05:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">off certain ideas and concepts, what is included in that concept? So let's at least make sure we go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=352s">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">through each one and we begin with making sure that we put off falsehood and put on truth. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=359s">00:05:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">therefore laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor for we are members of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=365s">00:06:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one another. Now we ask this question, what are some examples of falsehood? And what I like to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=372s">00:06:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is rather than giving you all the various examples of meditation or meditating through that, I leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=378s">00:06:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that for your discussions in your small groups and also I leave that for you to actually answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=382s">00:06:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the many forms, many scenarios in which we exercise falsehood? Now right now with our BAM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=393s">00:06:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry, our Strangles Adult ministry, we are going through this seminar called Own Your Fears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=398s">00:06:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's really interesting about this is that I realized after not only just looking at scriptures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=405s">00:06:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but examining life, our fears cause us to lots of silly things whether it be to run away but one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=412s">00:06:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those things that it causes us to do is lie. It almost feels so instinctual for us to lie to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=420s">00:07:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out of bad situations, to lie to get ahead in fear of either getting in trouble then or losing out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=427s">00:07:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on an opportunity. We are so tempted to lie all over different circumstances and places and even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=433s">00:07:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in something as neutral as basketball, even on the court, there are temptations to lie. So as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=443s">00:07:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">think about this, I recognize that this challenge for us to lay aside falsehood could be a difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=451s">00:07:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one. And take a moment to observe that the command then actually includes an interesting compound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=458s">00:07:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">idea here, which is that you should be laying aside, which is a participle. That is an ongoing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=464s">00:07:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">activity and the imperative is you should be speaking truth. And then so you realize sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=472s">00:07:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when we think about our own struggle, right? In order for us to speak the truth in a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=478s">00:07:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">moment, man, we have to pull away the already, I guess, dirty clothes that we have, right? In this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=486s">00:08:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">whole analogy of putting off and putting on, the already dirty clothes that we have and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=491s">00:08:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">instinctual kind of knee-jerk reactions we have to lie to save face. We need to make sure that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=500s">00:08:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">knee-jerk reaction, I mean, sometimes we don't have to be even creative to lie. It just comes out in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=505s">00:08:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the moment, right? And what we have to do is regularly fight those temptations. It is a difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=511s">00:08:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to do. And I ask you to meditate. Why is it sometimes so difficult for us when someone asks us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=517s">00:08:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">even an opinion, a personal opinion, we are calculating certain things. And then we always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=523s">00:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">try to give a safe, safe answer. Whether it's just to appease the person who asked, why is it so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=530s">00:08:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">difficult for me to even expose what I'm actually thinking? We have to meditate on these things. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=536s">00:08:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we realize that speaking the truth sometimes is a lot more difficult than we think it is. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=543s">00:09:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a huge challenge for us. But also I want us to notice within this passage that there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=549s">00:09:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">motivation. And what he says is, "For we are members of one another." And so we have to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=556s">00:09:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the question. We observe the rationale clearly that because we're members of one another, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=562s">00:09:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have to speak truth to each other. But how does our membership motivate my honesty? Why is it that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=569s">00:09:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as members, we have to speak truth to one another? Well, in order to just kind of meditate about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=575s">00:09:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this, I have an example, which is I think about our church and I'm so grateful that the departments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=583s">00:09:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess you could say, or the service teams that we have. I mean, we have close to, I think I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=588s">00:09:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">counted was 27 different service teams. Now, some of these service teams, they're not like big teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=595s">00:09:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're not doing a whole lot of like every week activity, but these teams exist to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=600s">00:10:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">support all the various ministries of the church. And if these teams didn't exist, there'd be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=604s">00:10:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something that would be neglected. Okay? But then you can imagine amongst 27 teams, and also we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=610s">00:10:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have, you know, four different affinities. We have the education department, college, youth, and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=615s">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of stuff. Right? When you think about that, there is potential there for competition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=620s">00:10:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">amongst departments. And what's really interesting is that if each service team lead, each affinity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=627s">00:10:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">group leader was not godly, but actually competing with each other, and maybe they were competing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=632s">00:10:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for budget, maybe they're competing for personnel. And they started to say, well, I want that service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=638s">00:10:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">leader. Maybe it's Matt Chong. Like I want him on my team. And the other person says, no, I need him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=643s">00:10:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for youth. And another person says, no, I need him to build stuff at church or whatever it may be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=647s">00:10:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Now, as soon as you have that kind of motive of competition, there has to be a rationale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=655s">00:10:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what ends up happening? You sometimes exaggerate your need. We have nobody. Right? And then so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=662s">00:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes even with budget, people do this. They realize like, oh my gosh, we have leftover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=666s">00:11:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">budget. Then pizza party for all, and we're going to give gifts to. Why? Because you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=670s">00:11:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bump up your budget to make it seem like you have all these expenditures. Do those kind of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=677s">00:11:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ever take place? It can if we don't check our hearts. And so I just want to give that example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=683s">00:11:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Why? Because if we're members of one another, if one piece is just as important as another, if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=690s">00:11:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">education department and the college department and the welcome team are all elements of the body</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=699s">00:11:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like the scripture says, that's the eye and the nose and the ear. Think about how ridiculous it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=705s">00:11:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">would be that the eye would compete against the nose. Think about how ridiculous it would be for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=711s">00:11:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">your arm to compete against your thigh. I mean, those kinds of examples just are a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=716s">00:11:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">silly, but that's how ridiculous it would be. We are all a part of the body and therefore rely on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=722s">00:12:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">each other, not compete with each other. And that kind of competition, a threat to each other is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=726s">00:12:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes a great motive behind the lying. Okay. Let's go move on to the next one. Number two, put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=734s">00:12:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">off anger and put on what was tough. Sometimes I wish it was just clearly spelled out for you, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=743s">00:12:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly there's some things we're supposed to put on in the whole pattern of the teaching. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=748s">00:12:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">passage says, "Be angry and yet do not sin and do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=755s">00:12:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">give the devil opportunity." Now this exhortation and admonishment has a lot of questions. Hey, wait</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=760s">00:12:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a minute. Why does it say, "Be angry"? Shouldn't it say, "Don't be angry," right? Because am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=767s">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to actually be angry about stuff? And why is it that in personal experience, I always feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=773s">00:12:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">guilty whenever I get angry, you know? And also it just seems very contrary to expectation here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=779s">00:12:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more, what is this principle about not letting the sun go down on your anger? Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=785s">00:13:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what's very clear is you notice I highlighted for you guys that there is a repetition of the do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=791s">00:13:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nots. So clearly what you find here then is you're supposed to, at some points, you're allowed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=800s">00:13:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">provision for, you're supposed to be angry in the sense that there are things that anger us. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=805s">00:13:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there are cautions and warnings that clearly tell us that it can go wrong so fast. Okay? Now I ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=812s">00:13:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this question again, but what are we supposed to put on? Like, are we supposed to put off anger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=817s">00:13:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and also then put on anger? What are we supposed to do here? Now, I want us to think about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=823s">00:13:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is a great opportunity to do a word study. If you're looking at a term that says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=829s">00:13:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Be angry," and you're like, "Well, I understand the word angry, but clearly there's kind of more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=834s">00:13:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">than meets the eye," or at least, "I need to know what he's talking about specifically," do a word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=839s">00:13:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">study. And what we find is that there are two different words for anger in this passage. Notice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=845s">00:14:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "Be angry," the Greek word is "orgie," yet, "Do not sin." Do not let the sun go down on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=852s">00:14:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">your, and it doesn't actually repeat the same word, but it uses a different word, "paragizmo."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=857s">00:14:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the idea here then, the translations are pretty similar. It says, "Wrath, make angry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=862s">00:14:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">provoke," but the first term is passive, and it's used in lots of different contexts. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=869s">00:14:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the second word is to make angry to a violent or bitter anger, and is only found here. Here is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=877s">00:14:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">word dictionary of the New Testament, says this, "Although both paragizmos and orgie are translated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=882s">00:14:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wrath, they are not the same in meaning. On the one hand, paragizmos signifies the kind of severe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=889s">00:14:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or violent anger which arises from direct provocation, an aroused anger, or seething</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=894s">00:14:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">exasperation. Such behavior is contrary to the Spirit and the Word of God. On the other hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=900s">00:15:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">orgie refers to anger in general, and though it is used of sinful anger, it is also used of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=905s">00:15:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">righteous indignation, such as certain passages." Okay? So, take a moment to think about that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=913s">00:15:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and you realize that what he's trying to say then is when you look at this passage, yes, there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=920s">00:15:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">times and moments where because of what you're getting angry about, and because of how you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=926s">00:15:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">getting angry, and because to what end, right? Like what is causing you to do, all those things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=931s">00:15:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">matter. So, if you're getting angry in righteous indignation because of the blasphemy of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=938s">00:15:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or some kind of dishonor to the Lord, or some kind of injustice towards the oppressed and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=943s">00:15:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">helpless, that clearly is a kind of anger we've seen within Scripture. But is there an ungodliness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=950s">00:15:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in you that is self-righteously angered because you didn't get honored? Is it controlled? Is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=958s">00:15:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a controlled passion where there's clear thinking, there's still truthfulness of words, or is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=963s">00:16:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">violent, uncontrolled, raging, right? But what's more, there's this interesting kind of caveat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=972s">00:16:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here that tells us, "Do not sin, do not let go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=979s">00:16:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity." So, here are the warnings. The warnings of not doing this, and not doing that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=985s">00:16:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and not doing this. Now, this part of it I thought kind of funny because I remember reading some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=989s">00:16:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">books about anger, and in one book, I remember it saying, "Man, you have to resolve anger then and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=996s">00:16:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there." So, it was actually one of the marriage books that I read that talked about how you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1000s">00:16:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to resolve then and there. Now, I am one that has a hard time doing that because I have to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1006s">00:16:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">through, "Why am I feeling this way? What am I actually even feeling? How do I put it into words?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1011s">00:16:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it takes me a while, okay? So, I'm not good with resolving then and there. What's funny is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1016s">00:16:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that through a story the book was trying to teach, like, you have to resolve it quickly though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1020s">00:17:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Husband and wife, husband and wife gets in a fight. It's late into the evening. Perhaps the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1025s">00:17:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">gentleman says, "You know what? I don't want to fight like this anymore. Let's talk about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1028s">00:17:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">tomorrow." He goes to bed. He wakes up and he realizes his wife is now four times as mad as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1034s">00:17:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">before because she's thinking, "How could you sleep?" Right? She stayed up all night. "How could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1040s">00:17:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you sleep? Don't you even care?" Right? Now, what's funny is I read another book that said, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1046s">00:17:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">don't take this literally, okay? If you're fighting at 2 a.m., you don't have sobriety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1052s">00:17:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You're tired. You don't have the motivation to be cautious with your words. This is not some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1058s">00:17:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">literal wooden principle where you have to make sure that the sun doesn't go down because if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1062s">00:17:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">start fighting at 10 p.m., the sun's already down, right? It's not literally supposed to be taken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1067s">00:17:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's some kind of wisdom there, but the wisdom simply is this. If you allow anger to grow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1074s">00:17:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it gives fuel for such other vices. Whether it be judgment, resentment, bitterness, hatred,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1083s">00:18:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan uses that as a means for scheming. And so, as a challenge to you, you have to think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1089s">00:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">does your anger fuel more godliness? Does it fuel truthful words that helps the other individuals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1096s">00:18:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Or does it fuel some kind of retribution, some vindictiveness? Okay? All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1104s">00:18:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Moving to the next point here, number three, the put off and put on principles. It says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1110s">00:18:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">put off stealing and put on generosity. Passas says, "He who steals must steal no longer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1116s">00:18:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1122s">00:18:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to share with one who has need." Okay? As a reminder, this is kind of interesting because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1129s">00:18:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of you out there aren't going to the liquor store</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1135s">00:18:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and stealing candy like we used to when we were kids, right? Maybe it was just me, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1140s">00:19:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">guilty I did that because there was a lot of adrenaline when you're a kid. But when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1145s">00:19:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">older, obviously you don't steal. However, however, this passage is speaking to the general public,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1151s">00:19:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's teaching churches. Yes, it's written to Ephesus, but it was meant to be circulated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1157s">00:19:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we find is that these are major areas of life that we struggle with. And it's some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1163s">00:19:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like a universal pattern. And there's a lot of questions like, "Wow, what can we learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1169s">00:19:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about the nature of stealing that entices so many people? And what are the different forms of theft</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1176s">00:19:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that perhaps we struggle with even to this day?" And again, I want you to think about it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1180s">00:19:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">meditate. Why is it that even as adults sometimes, I mean, think about how many get rich quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1186s">00:19:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">schemes there are, and it's been around for ages, and yet they still somehow capture people's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1192s">00:19:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, tempts people. And perhaps because the demand is already right here. And what form of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1200s">00:20:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">stealing is there? Whether it be taking credit for something that's absolutely not yours,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1204s">00:20:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at work taking credit for things, at work stealing work property. Like, is there stealing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1212s">00:20:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">happens within the workplace now that it's a little bit more sophisticated as opposed to at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1217s">00:20:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the liquor store? Perhaps. Copying and pasting when you're studying. I mean, there are many forms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1222s">00:20:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can think about, but you can take time to think about that. All I want to say is this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1227s">00:20:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's really interesting here, if you notice, is he who steals must steal no longer. Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1234s">00:20:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">stealing actually in terms of the selfishness and the rationale of a thief that's there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1240s">00:20:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it is so enticing, it typically becomes a pattern. It typically becomes a pattern,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1245s">00:20:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it typically becomes a way of life, and it's not just reserved to sticking something in your pocket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1250s">00:20:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I'm saying is we have to be warned against this temptation. Now, when we think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1257s">00:20:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the put on, please observe that there are actually two things that Apostle Paul challenges us to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1264s">00:21:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on in order to put off our former self in the selfishness that we have. And the very first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1271s">00:21:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he says is actually to labor. He says, "Rather labor, performing with his own hands what is good."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1282s">00:21:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, what is good? And so I want to give this admonition. Notice that when there is a pattern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1292s">00:21:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of perhaps the flip side of what it means to labor, which is to be a free bird, kind of an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1299s">00:21:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">individual who likes to get things for free, an individual who likes to maybe write off the work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1304s">00:21:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of others, an individual who has expectations that everybody else is supposed to parent their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1309s">00:21:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lives and provide for them and carry their weight, an individual who does not know how to carry their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1314s">00:21:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">own burden. These are the rationale of the individuals who perhaps may be tempted with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1319s">00:21:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stealing. Now, on the flip side, remember that Apostle Paul, he said in scripture, whether it be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1327s">00:22:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in 1 Thessalonians, he says, "I work day and night not to be a burden to any of you." Right now, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1332s">00:22:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have to go the extreme. If an individual gives you a gift, receive it with gratitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1337s">00:22:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">However, do not go around expecting that people is going to always provide for you your needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1346s">00:22:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Why? Because that kind of rationale lends to temptation. What's more, he says, "Put on generosity."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1355s">00:22:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "You may not be necessarily having this gross pattern of stealing where you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1360s">00:22:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to the store and grabbing stuff, but an individual who steals, in order to combat that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1365s">00:22:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to actually put on an intentional giving that you would actually not only work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1370s">00:22:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but that working, you would not just raise money and say, 'Now, I took care of myself,'</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1375s">00:22:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but now you have to be so intentional and say, 'I worked and I deserve the fruit of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1378s">00:22:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm going to now take that and give and sacrifice.'" And what you realize is, man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1385s">00:23:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">generosity is not something you have an arbitrary standard by. How much should you give?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1392s">00:23:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Generosity doesn't have the kind of logic that the thief has, which tries to maximize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1399s">00:23:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If I work this few hours and can get this much reward, then of course, that's the rationale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1405s">00:23:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But this generous individual says, "I could work this much hours, but I could give this much."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1411s">00:23:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a logic of cost-benefit analysis. Rather, it's a kind of love that comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1417s">00:23:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the wealth that we have in Christ. And so that's a huge challenge for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1422s">00:23:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, number four, "In the pattern of the put-off of the unwholesome words and to put on words of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1430s">00:23:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">edification and grace." Okay. Here, he says, "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1438s">00:23:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1445s">00:24:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will give grace to those who hear." Now, this is a big, big challenge because in our regular than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1451s">00:24:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">daily social life, this is something we have to make sure like we're on top of. Because scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1459s">00:24:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actually says, "You know what? We all stumble in many ways, but man, if you could keep a rain on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1464s">00:24:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your tongue, that's huge." Okay. I mean, read James chapter three. Remember how the scripture talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1470s">00:24:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about your mouth as one of the most powerful weapons you have. I mean, you think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1474s">00:24:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something with power, right? Like a ship has a little rudder and that thing changes course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1479s">00:24:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I mean, think about the spark that ignites a fire in the forest. I mean, the power contained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1484s">00:24:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in our mouths is so much. Here, the challenge is to put aside all unwholesome words. And here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1491s">00:24:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we could take some time to think about some questions. Yeah. What does this unwholesome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1495s">00:24:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">words mean? What's practically included in that? And a big, big question that a lot of us are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1503s">00:25:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to ask is, "Does this include joking? Like, can I be sarcastic? Is it okay to kind of be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1509s">00:25:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">witty and go back and forth with my bro?" Now, that's something actually to think about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1513s">00:25:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you could have an honest debate about that. Let's do a quick word study again, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1518s">00:25:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes if we're confused about what does this concept include, it's good to do a word study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1524s">00:25:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm just going to show you this. Here, it talks about words that are rotten or putrid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1530s">00:25:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a very descriptive word. Words that decay. Word that causes this stench. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1538s">00:25:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">even in our modern terms, we have a modern way of saying, "Man, that guy has a potty mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1544s">00:25:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like a foul mouth," right? So, clearly this passage is not talking about like, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1548s">00:25:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you said something slightly insensitive. Now, should you do that?" No, the answer is no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1553s">00:25:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But this passage is more so talking about things that are vulgar, right? Things that are distasteful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1559s">00:25:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and real putrid, okay? Now, as we think about this though, it doesn't just stop there. When it tells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1566s">00:26:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you to put on the kind of words that you should be speaking, please observe that it says, "Your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1570s">00:26:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">words should be good for edification. Your words should be meeting the need of the moment. Your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1578s">00:26:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">words should give grace." Wow. Now, some of us, we're so intuitive. I mean, we look at our brother</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1586s">00:26:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and sister and we can sense their need and we can give them words of encouragement. And to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1591s">00:26:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just, when I see people doing that, I'm like, "Man, that's so good." Why? Because scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1597s">00:26:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">says that is such a valuable thing. Proverbs 25 verse 11 says, "Like apples of gold in settings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1604s">00:26:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of silver is a word spoken in right circumstances." Okay? And I want you to observe something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1611s">00:26:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It is difficult for us in every scenario in life to work through some kind of process where we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1617s">00:26:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking like, "Is this good for them? Is this good for them? Is this like meeting their needs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1624s">00:27:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this edifying them?" But I want you to think about that. Yes, that could be a bit cumbersome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=1629s">00:27:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but that is the kind of intentionality that God wants us to have.

Is there anger? Is there clamor? Is there slander? Now what I'm going to just say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2260s">00:37:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is I do believe there is some kind of build toward this. Like there's a bitterness, there's a wrath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2264s">00:37:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's an anger that moves typically for you curses or for you slandering, for you gossiping,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2270s">00:37:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for you speaking ill of them and wishing ill of them. But what's all interesting is that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2275s">00:37:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">term for malice, again, malice is an intent of wickedness.

And so essentially the intent of the heart is towards damage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2298s">00:38:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">inflicting harm, or some kind of hatred towards an individual. These are the things that sometimes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2304s">00:38:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, we are all tempted with. And sometimes we're tempted with those sentiments towards the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2312s">00:38:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who are even within our own household. And what we have to do is overcome these things, putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2317s">00:38:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them aside and putting on the love of Christ. The passage tells us that we need to put on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2323s">00:38:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">kindness, the tender heartedness, and the forgiving intention of Christ. Now I want you to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2330s">00:38:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. There are times when you run into somebody who's just like, "We don't click." Right? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2337s">00:38:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just like, I cannot stand that guy. Right? Now, to some degree, that's all understandable because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2343s">00:39:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think the scripture calls us to be accountability partners, one-on-one, best friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2347s">00:39:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">forever with every single person in the church.

Okay. However, we have to exercise a certain kind of control by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2364s">00:39:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the love of Christ, right? The love of Christ controls us. Earlier, there was a passage that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2369s">00:39:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">challenged us to put aside anger and to make sure that we're not allowing it to have a foothold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2377s">00:39:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That I believe was challenging us to put on control. Why? Because in control, there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2383s">00:39:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">limits so that although we are angry, we do not sin. There are limits so that although we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2388s">00:39:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">angry, we do not let it reside in our hearts forever. And there is some kind of control so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2393s">00:39:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that we do not allow it to be fueled even further and allowing the devil to fuel other kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2400s">00:40:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">schemes and revengeful type of thoughts. Here, likewise, what we're supposed to be controlled by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2407s">00:40:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is the kindness, tender heartedness, and forgiveness that we've received from Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/420514994#t=2413s">00:40:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?
