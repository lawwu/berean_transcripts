href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=177s">00:02:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was just coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=203s">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I remember growing up, we didn't really drink much coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=206s">00:03:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't start drinking coffee until I was probably about 31 or 32 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=210s">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why was because I started to teach ESL to Korean grandparents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=218s">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I wasn't on my game, you know, I would lose them.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=230s">00:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, the best way to describe it is kind of giving five-hour sermons five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/548730338#t=235s">00:03:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">times a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
