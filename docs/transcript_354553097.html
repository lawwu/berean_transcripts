My goal is to get you out of here while it's still two something. Okay, that's a good goal? Okay, hopefully before the big hand hits the nine, but we'll see, all right? Let me pray and then we'll begin.</p><p>Lord, we thank you for just putting us together, not just in our small family units, but collectively at a church together where we can sharpen each other, where we can really grow together. And it does take a village and we thank you for putting us together in this village so that we can really help each other raise our children up in the fear of the Lord.</p><p>We pray for your help today, that this would be a smooth meeting, that all the parents would really be at peace knowing that as a church we really do wanna see their kids grow in their faith and to bring you glory and honor in their lives. And that as a church, education department, that we're working alongside them to, just to nurture and to, just to feed.</p><p>So we thank you and pray these things in Jesus' name. So this is our first ever all education department, I guess, parents meeting. We're gonna keep doing it this way as we get bigger. Hold up real quick. Okay, so this is just a little bit of a structure, just to show you what things look like.</p><p>Our family ministry, it's kind of broken up into the family ministry and the SO department. SO means students of the word. I came up with that in 2002 and then I brought it to Berean in 2005 and then I came back and it's still stuck. So it has since evolved to seeds, vines, sprouts, saplings, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>But students of the word is the moniker and the vine is our youth ministry. We've since changed it to seventh to 12th. So our sixth graders are actually staying behind. So seventh to 12th. Sprouts is kindergarten to sixth. Seeds is one to four years old by September. And then included in this, we have our awana and events and child safety.</p><p>So just so that there's a clarity in your heads as to what this is. And I feel like the SO is appropriate because we really don't know how many of our kids in the education department really have a relationship with Christ. And that is not something that is easy to discern at this age.</p><p>But most people who come to faith, come to faith before they hit 14. So we are praying alongside you and investing alongside you that in God's time fruit will be born. So this is a little bit of the structure. These are all our teachers. We have 30. And the ones in the red are the ones who are serving with us on staff for the first time.</p><p>So the vine is a youth. Sprouts is our Sunday school children's ministry. And seeds is our nursery. Okay. Now what we've decided with this change with Pastor Mark, switch me and Pastor Mark switch in our BAM and youth hats. We brought all the education department under my care. And we have since decided to do our own Bible study.</p><p>And we're going to be doing that in the Philippines on Tuesday nights. And so just sharing with you what our Bible study looks like. We have praise. We have inductive Bible study discussion. And then we have a teaching section. And normally if you guys are in your home groups or here on Wednesday, after the teaching session you break up into application.</p><p>With our teachers, everyone breaks up into departments. And because we're also studying Philippians with your kids, it gives our teachers to contextualize it and make it the lessons age appropriate. Obviously with seeds, it's hard to do any kind of inductive anything. So we're keeping the seeds as it's been going.</p><p>And it's, we don't need to touch the curriculum per se for the seeds. So but with every other group from kindergarten all the way up to seniors in high school and even the college ministry, we're all on Philippians. And so this is also added motivation for you guys to review with your children.</p><p>So that's what we're doing. And every Sunday morning, our teachers are all going to get together in the Sprouts room and pray. Pray for your service. Pray for our kids. And if there are any needs that come up, we will pray together for those children and their families. Okay?</p><p>So please, do not hesitate to shoot prayer requests to us. We will pray for them in the event that you're okay with it being private or public. So the Philippians curriculum for the youth group and the elementary, the vine and the sprouts, everyone's going to get a worksheet sent home.</p><p>Okay? And then the worksheet is going to usually be about four pages, including discussion questions and including study notes and including memory verse. Okay? Now, the worksheets are tailored toward high school and junior high kids. So if your first grader gets a worksheet that's made for high school, junior high kids, obviously you're not going to be happy about it.</p><p>But the reason we're doing that is because I can't make 12 sets of worksheets. I just make one for the youth. And as a parent, you get to see it and then work through that with your child. And so we're always going to be about two, three weeks behind the church, the adult church on the whole.</p><p>So you'll have had access to it. You'll have studied it. And then you can review it with your children. Okay? So we are trying to unify our entire education department. I actually did some math. Without any new families, let's say we don't bring in another new person in our church, our youth group is going to be about 70 in about five years.</p><p>Our children's ministry will be about 160 in five years. And depending on how productive or how unproductive you guys are and how people inbreed and stuff, we might be at another 150 for the nursery. So I'm not planning for this year. I'm planning for the next five and then thinking ahead to the next ten.</p><p>So we do need to structure it. Some of you guys might be thinking, wait, we have 20 youth group kids, but we have eight teachers? Great. Because if we add another 30 youth group kids, our teachers are ready to take that on. So that's without any new families coming in.</p><p>So one thing that we do ask for is there's going to be a lot of unorganized stuff. Because we're trying to prep for the next five to ten. So one, if you're like, well, this is so unorganized, you can complain to me. But that's fine. And then I'll just pray sanctification on your life.</p><p>But just be patient with us and help us. And what I don't want are most of our children's ministry, youth group department, teachers to come from young adults. I would rather have us as families help families. So as a family unit, if you have a desire to serve in the education department, please let us know.</p><p>I mean, we do have criteria. But our desire is for it to be the families leading our education department. Amen? Okay? And that's hard. Because you guys are like, I need to spend time with the Lord. I'm tired. But rest doesn't come by inactivity. Rest comes from doing and serving in a way that rekindles the why in your life.</p><p>So the worksheets, fourth grade and up, we'll be doing those, the worksheets in class on Sunday. K through third, the worksheets are going home with you. And I'm going to be putting them up on the family ministry page. Just curriculum, the PDF. So you get it every week. So you know what your children are doing.</p><p>But this is not meant for the kid to do this for homework. Are you guys following me? It's for you to see what we're doing as an education department and then tailor digesting it for your child. And the seeds, it's going to continue with how it's done. And we're going to get to that when we introduce each department.</p><p>All right? And as of September 1st, I'm going to be the pastor overseeing the youth ministry. So the children's ministry, I've been preaching to them for about a year's time. But the teachers are now going to rotate through the children's ministry. And I'm moving to do the youth on Fridays and Sundays.</p><p>And as the youth teachers have shared or the parents have shared, I do have big shoes to fill. Pastor Mark really did a good job ministering to those children. But I'm moving into that role. And so this is what our youth group will look like on Friday nights. I'm going to be doing a Bible just surveys.</p><p>So the children will be able to know what's where in the Bible in a way that's easy to remember. So we'll start with Bible and then Old Testament survey and then New Testament survey in a way where they'll get to know what each of the books of the Bible is about and then try to help them navigate through just the whole of Scripture so they could inductively study it on their own at 13, 14, 15, 16.</p><p>Hopefully that is amenable to you guys. Sunday we're doing a Philippians. And then when we have praise and prayer, we're taking a break because we don't want to get off the schedule. So Philippians is what we'll be doing on Sunday. So for you, you should know what your kids are learning that Sunday because you will have prepared it at home on your own two weeks prior.</p><p>So this is an encouragement for you to be more involved with your child's spiritual education without adding anything. So it's just like let's maximize what we're already at. So our boys are going to be broken up this way. And I actually have the teachers stand here because we do have some new families.</p><p>Ryan, Matt, Sky, Sam, Kate. Amber's in, I think she's, there's a conference going on and she's there. But oh, she's not here. Oh, Sam's not here either. Okay. So Ryan Chang right there in the burgundy, he's going to be the teacher and small group leader for Charles, Jamie, and George.</p><p>Matt Yee, he was one of the reasons we started children's ministry. So he was in like the second grade when he came to Berean and I had him then. So he was our fourth grade youth group student because we had fourth to seniors and three-year-olds to third grade. So our church was even more chaotic then, believe it or not, our education department.</p><p>But Matt is a product of the labor, the baton passing labor. And now he's full circle and he's going to influence either positively or negatively the next generation. Sky has been a staple at Berean youth. So she's going to be taking Faith, Hope, Pauline, and Priscilla. Sam Ho, who you guys know, but she's not here.</p><p>Taylor, Edelise, and then Julia. Kate, who's Ryan's wife, will be Amy Charity and Mary Mobley's small group leader Sunday school teacher. And then Amber, who is one of our most recent college graduates, she'll have Audrey and Irene. And this is a pretty good ratio, but any new students that come in, we have more than enough just love and energy and space to cater to them.</p><p>So please pray over them, youth group teachers. So every Friday night they're going to be here ministering to your children. So please remember them, pray for them. Okay, I'm going to ask you guys to take a seat. Yay. Woohoo. And I do want to introduce the Sprouts. And I'll go through this relatively quickly because there are some detailed things that we do need to talk up in terms of safety and stuff like that toward the end.</p><p>So this is our staff. I don't know if you guys can see it clearly, but we have 13 staff in the Sprouts department, which is our children's ministry. And then the class breakdowns, can I have you guys come up, the teachers? Because like I said, we do have a few new families here so that they know who's who.</p><p>There's a big group. So my philosophy is the more people doing less, the better. So we have a lot of teachers and so that the teachers take turns really preparing the lessons and there is a lot of love and care that goes into individual students. And we do have probably, there's going to be about 50 to 60 kids just in September.</p><p>But kindergarten, the kindergarten students, Mara's done a great job this past year. So she's taking the kinders again. So Mara, Chris, and then Nick Yu is going to be helping with the kindergarten students. The first graders, as you guys can see there. So if your child is going to be a first grader in the fall, Josh, just raise your hands.</p><p>Josh, Kiani, keep your hands raised. Kiani, John Yang, and Gloria who's not here, they're going to be the ones taking care of the first graders. Second grade students, Joe and Michelle, these two, they're going to be the ones in charge of the second graders. Third and fourth grade, it's a combined class.</p><p>Melissa Wong, who's been here, she is now the longest tenured Bereans teacher. She overthrew Matt Chong. And I recruited her back in like '08, '09. So she's stuck. And then Stephen Mose is also going to be doing third and fourth grade. And Florence Yu, she's right there. And Chris are going to be with the oldest children.</p><p>And so give them a round of applause. They're going to be the ones who've loved on your children. We have 100% engagement. So they all came back. And so we added just three more teachers. So they're going to be doing the children's ministry. You guys can go ahead and take your seats.</p><p>So this is what Sunday school looks like for the children's ministry. And I will upload the PowerPoint to the Berean Family Facebook page. So you guys can just access it and look it over on your own. 1045, we'll do a teacher huddle and prayer. 1115, we have a praise and offering.</p><p>And I do want to emphasize because we do have a number of families coming at 1130, 1140 regularly. And that's not a one-time thing. That's regularly. And you guys know that the service starts at 1115. And Pastor Peter always says, "Your faith to the next generation is caught more than it is taught." Meaning, they're not going to always listen to what you say, but they're going to observe what you do and pick up what the values and the priorities are in your family by that.</p><p>So if your family is regularly coming at 1130, that means the praise time for your family indirectly gets communicated as not that important. So if you are coming here for yourself at 1115, you need to check your kids in by 1105. And just another, I mean, this is the only opportunity I have.</p><p>So I'm not coming down on you. But like we do have parents outside hanging out 1120, and the kids can hear the praise starting and the parents chatting and giggling in the back. So just know that our kids see everything. And so that's something just as an encouragement, what you value is caught by your kids rather than taught.</p><p>And so my encouragement is help them prepare their hearts for worship to understand that Sunday morning is priority for the family. Amen? Can you just give me a little, yeah. Some of you guys are like, "Amen!" Yes. 1115, so there's a 20-minute, usually a 15-minute sermon. And then there's an activity or an application with the class, memory verses.</p><p>So they've broken up into their Bible study classes. There's a review and closing praise. And then there's the "Because He Lives" at 1245. And so the parents, if the Sunday's done at like 1230, and just because you're socially like a little bit like, "I don't want to hang out with people," don't come and grab your kid out of class.</p><p>And so please just respect the 1245 time. And then we do have a sponsor child in our Sprouts. The kids are asked to bring a dollar every month. And we ask you not to give them a dollar. They have to somehow earn it so that they understand, "I am doing this for this person who's in Ecuador, Luis.</p><p>I'm meeting him next week with our teachers. I'm going to his house. So I'm going to share with your children what situation, like what his living situation is, et cetera, et cetera." So just that's a first of every month. You will get email reminder, little message reminders just to send a dollar with your child.</p><p>If you want to... Like, some parents are like, "You know, I don't want to think that far. Here's 10 bucks. Don't bother me for the year." We want your child to learn every month what it means to intentionally pray for and take care of a child that is not necessarily related to them.</p><p>I'm going to give you guys an opportunity to ask questions at the end. Right now I'm going to ask Jenny Kim to come up and share about the seeds. All right. I'll do the slides. Yeah. You can hear me. So I don't need a mic. Go, go, go, go.</p><p>Try, try, try. Go now. Go now. All right. Thank you, everyone. So I'm Jenny. For those who don't know, some people call me Jenni at Berean. I'm here to just present on behalf of our seeds. So I want to start off with our roster. So as you guys can see up here on the screen, our class sizes are getting much bigger.</p><p>So last year we were projected to... By last year, I mean this school year, we're projected to end at the end of August with 77 students. So you can see that that number is growing. Every year since we've had our ministry, it's grown about 10 to 15 students. And that's not counting our newcomers.</p><p>That's just our committed families. Because I know a lot of you guys are having your seconds or your thirds or more. So we want to make sure that we're ready. So we always have a running roster going. So we wanted you guys to take a look. Now when you see the class D and E, I know that'll be a little bit confusing.</p><p>What that is talking about is really everything that's in class C. But we call it D and E because of their age. So we split it per age. And so that you know the class sizes, we do have newcomers coming every single week. So just anticipate that that number will continue to grow over time.</p><p>So we're going to have 86. A lot of kids. All right. We used to think 50 was big. It's like, it's a lot more than that. So with our growing number, obviously we went ahead and we added new teachers into our group. For those of you who don't know the teachers by name, they're all up there for you.</p><p>And what I'm doing is I used to be in class C with the other leaders, but I'm being transitioned to class B because now we need to class, we need to split class B between girls and boys. Not so much for first service because first service we don't have a lot of students coming in, but more for second.</p><p>Today we had 16 kids, right? And so we split the boys and the girls. Because they're transitioning from a monthly lesson that they learn every single week of that month in class C to having a new lesson, a new memory verse every single week. So that can be a really big transition for the kids.</p><p>And so we want to give them a little more focus, a little more attention when they're in class B before they get to class C. I'm sorry, class A. So you know the breakdown. What we cover in class C is we kind of go through the Bible. We go thematically.</p><p>So Jesus is big and strong. God is good. Things like that. Right? Or I'm sorry, God is big and strong. So is Jesus. But yeah, we go over that. Okay. So we go over that monthly throughout the year. And we have one memory verse each month. Okay? We go over Old Testament once they get into class B.</p><p>And then in class A, they go over the New Testament. Okay? So that you know the themes of that. So with all of our teachers, because now we're at 11, right? We also have a host of responsibilities that we've split up between us. Okay? Obviously, as you know, Sarah is our head honcho.</p><p>She does an excellent job with ministry, with the ministry. So she's our principal. Okay? And I'm in charge of the safety portion. Praise is with Jane and Rachel. We have volunteer staff relations. Okay? With Andy and Carla. So we monitor the schedule, the rotation, all that. Make sure everyone's, you know, with all the commitments that we've made in the year that we are sticking to that.</p><p>Newcomer relations, since we're having a huge surge of newcomers, we've needed more focus on that from our leaders. So, praise, obviously, you guys see the fruit of that through the YouTube channel. Media is handled by Mel and Kat. They handle the newsletter, any parent forums, things like that that we need to get out to you.</p><p>And prayer for your little ones is handled by Crystal. Okay? So this is the schedule for both of our services. So that you guys have the breakdown as well. Okay? I know most of you are pretty accustomed to the breakdown. I don't see a lot of new families here.</p><p>So if you guys are, you know, the old timers, all right? So you guys kind of have already got this down pat. But just so you know kind of how that's broken down. All right? Okay? And we just have some important reminders that we want to make sure that we let everybody know.</p><p>Okay? First is that with communication, we always use our Facebook page. So please make sure that you're checking that regularly. Okay? If there's any kind of notifications that come to you, make sure that you do that. I know some of you do not have Facebook, and that's completely fine.</p><p>If you don't and you didn't know about this, that we regularly use our Facebook page, just let me know so that we can add you into the emailing list. Okay? And we'll make sure that you guys are there. All right? Safety training. This is not obviously mandated for our parents.</p><p>But I've seen parents attend our safety training, and they're really pleased with what we've had, you know, put in place for the safety of their kids. So we do highly encourage our parents to go ahead and take safety training if you guys want to see what we have in place.</p><p>All right? As far as reviewing lessons and memory verses, I know this is something that we've touched upon a lot in the past with a lot of our parents that have been, you know, coming to SEADS for a while. But obviously for us, you know, our philosophy is that the teaching starts at home, and we're here as a supplemental resource to reinforce those lessons that you guys are constantly reviewing and, you know, going over with your kids.</p><p>So we just want to encourage parents, you know, as much as you can, please try to take time to review the memory verse, make sure that you try to explain in your own way. Because sometimes when it comes from the teacher, it's not the same as when it comes from mom or dad.</p><p>You know? You guys know your kids the best, so you can explain it the best. And so it's really helpful in that way to partner in that effort. Okay? We also want to talk about on the next slide� is there a slide? Ooh. So let me just tell you what the slide says.</p><p>Okay? I don't know what's missing. So snacks. I know some parents don't know, but we do ask that parents pack snacks for their kids every week for SEADS so that we can go ahead and give it to them during the snack time. Should your child forget, no worries. We just look at the back of their tag.</p><p>If you guys said snacks, okay, we give them what we have in our SEADS office. But we have that for any families that might have forgotten that week. You know, it was crazy in the morning, right? You can't get the snacks packed, right? It's fine. You know we got snacks, right?</p><p>We'll make sure your kid does not go hungry, all right? And so don't worry about that. But if you guys could pack that, that would be great. The other thing we always tell parents is no peanuts, please. We have some kids that have really severe allergies. We wouldn't want to have to take out an EpiPen or something.</p><p>You know, I don't want to do that. So if you guys could maybe, you know, stay away from the peanuts, that would be great. Or nuts in general. And then so labels. If you guys could make sure you label your snacks, you know, the snack packs or the sippy cups or your backpacks.</p><p>We have a lot more students now, especially with 85 plus, right? It's going to be even crazier. And a lot of them are starting to have the same stuff. So we're like, who's is this? I know Uriah has the same stuff as like Eleanor, so I'm always checking is it milk or water, right?</p><p>But if you guys could help us and do a label, that would be great. Okay? Okay. And if you guys have not potty training kids, sometimes there's accidents, right? So if you want a Ziploc, like an extra set of clothes, we will just tuck it into their cubby and we'll make sure we take care of you.</p><p>Okay? And then if you want a parent resource binder or folder, it's just $5 to class A and B, C, no charge. Okay? If you could cash, check or Venmo or PayPal, Sarah, that would be great. And that's it. Yeah. >> Church. >> Church. What? >> Venmo, church. >> Oh, Venmo, church.</p><p>Not Sarah. Venmo, church, guys. Okay? Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you, Kat. >> The next thing we're going to be talking about is we're going to change up our check-in process a little bit. What we want to do is protect our kids to make sure that they're safe. And so if you guys have noticed, midpoint in the year, we stopped allowing cars to park there.</p><p>Right? So our kids, you know, so that area is actually a lot more free. But we are going to change up the just check-in just to make it a little bit more efficient. Brother Joshan is going to come up and just share how it's all going to work out.</p><p>So Joe. Hold it. Hello? Joe is in the back. Hello? Hello? Hello? Joe is in the back. Hello? Testing. Hold on. Okay. So -- >> Is Josh going to demonstrate? >> I'll just talk loudly. Over there, if you take a look at the front, there's going to be on the left and the right side of the entrance a check-in stand that Josh is holding right now.</p><p>Okay? And basically on the check-in stand, what you're going to have is whether you are in seeds or in sprouts, you can check them in. Any of the check-in stands will check in both. Okay? After you check them in, you're going to walk them into the entrance where it says sprouts and seeds entrance.</p><p>And then only for sprouts, if they're late, if they're late, we ask you to check them in in the check-in kiosk and then walk around and come in through the back way. All right? That's pretty much it. So I'm going to actually show you what that check-in process looks like.</p><p>There we go. Okay. So it's going to look like this. Essentially all you have to do is enter your phone number. So let me give you an example. Okay. So I did the Mowgli's because there's five of them. He did the Mowgli family because there's lots of examples to use.</p><p>So similar to the check-in that you do for breeze for a members meeting, it's the same thing. All you have to do is check them and the check mark means that they're checked in. If you're only going to check in three, select three and then click on done. And then after that, they'll be checked in.</p><p>Sorry, it's lagging a little bit, but they're checked in. So for the check-in process is going to be, ignore that though. For the check-in process, that's all it's going to be. It's going to be based off your phone numbers. So we pretty much have everyone in the system. All they have to do is you have to just enter your phone number.</p><p>Okay. For checkout, can we go back? Oh, for the checkout process, essentially we're just going to have them come in, pick them up the way they're normally are. But we just ask for now to just please keep the entrance way as clear as possible. And then there will probably be changes maybe in the future.</p><p>It'll be TBA. Did you guys all hear that? No? Okay. So the check-in process is going to be what Joe demonstrated. The checkout is going to be the same as we've had it, but we may change it. Only request is don't crowd around and socialize and fellowship just around the front door to kind of crowd the area.</p><p>And so collect your child and move them and yourselves to a different part of the church where space is a lot more readily available. Okay. So okay, we'll hold off on questions until this last part. So we actually have a SOEvents ministry, Iwana Reformation Night, and then we have VBS and whatever other, as our church gets bigger, this will only continue to grow alongside of that.</p><p>So VBS, usually we have it in July, Reformation Night, usually on the night of October 31st. And Iwana, we are actually starting that for the first time this fall. So it's going to be our Guinea Pig Iwana held on Thursday nights. What is Iwana? It's approved workmen are not ashamed, coming from 2 Timothy 2.15.</p><p>So we're adopting much of what is done in the national Iwana. So students are divided according to their age, grade levels, and BCC will begin our first year of Iwana with just two of the groups, kindergarten to second graders, and then the third through sixth. This is what it will look like starting September.</p><p>Thursdays 7 to 8.30. 6.45, children arrive. 7 o'clock, we have a large group in games, depending on the age of the children. Small group, large group, games in small group, and then 8.30 is when the children are picked up. Right now, we're not opening it up to outside, non-Berean families, mainly because we want to figure out how to run it for our church.</p><p>And so if you guys are familiar with Iwana, it is a lot of incentive-based memory, just rote memorization, memorize verses, play games. It is a lot of fun, but we do want to try to tailor it to, it's not just, you're not just learning God's word for candy and for points and for toys and prizes.</p><p>So we do want to tailor it to our church's core values and needs. So we are going to work with this year and try to figure out what's the best way to continue going forward. So as of now, we are not opening it up to outside families. If you guys see here, we are always in search of people to help.</p><p>So if you guys have the heart to do this, you can talk to Jane Shin. Christine and Hannah Michelle Chong are the admins, and we have Becky, Laurel, Bia, and Mama as the leaders of the children. And they're all the leaders, so far a lot of the leaders' wives, and hopefully we can transition other parents to come in and also participate over the course of time.</p><p>And we have Rachel and Lindsay helping with the games. So if you, it doesn't mean we can't use your help. If you'd like to volunteer, please let Jane Shin know. If you don't know who she is, you'll find out soon enough. If you need her email address, it's on all of our programs, okay, for just to contact Jane Shin, okay?</p><p>So help us help you. So what we are hoping for for Rwana is for the parents who are dropping off their kids to be fully involved, to help teach, plan, and organize. Help us help you, okay? So this doesn't work if it's not implemented also at home. And lastly, before I open it up to questions, we do have our safety training, and right now we are in a lot of discussion on how to improve this.</p><p>As of right now, it's a lot of child protection-related things, like who is able to take whom to the bathroom, who can change diapers, what we require of all of our, the people who are working with the children. But we do at some point wanna incorporate even like some degree of disaster training, some degree of emergency protocol.</p><p>And so we are in the works for that. Please do not bombard our email addresses with like concerns and stuff. We are preparing for that and trying to figure out what's best for the church, not just for any particular family. But we do have the next safety training, September 15th at 2 p.m.</p><p>here. And if you are a parent, my encouragement would be to come to this, because at some point, because we're asking you to get involved with our education department, you can't just work with your child, right? And so the sooner this is done, the easier it is for us to move you around.</p><p>There's a lot of people at our church, last minute they wanna like sign up to help with the VBS and Reformation Night and things like that. But because we do have a policy in place, you have to be safety trained, so we can't take on, like we can't take on a lot of the people.</p><p>So our encouragement is we do offer this quarterly, and when you can, please take advantage. And so it'll, time frame will feel like today, just two to three-ish. So if you can, please sign up and participate in this. If you have any questions concerning our safety training, you can talk to Jane Shin, okay?</p><p>Now I do wanna open it up to questions that's related to all the education department. I don't have all the answers, but there are people here who probably have the answers that I don't. And so any of the parents, if you guys have any questions or concerns or anything, what do I do if I don't have a Facebook, et cetera, et cetera, like anything.</p><p>If you don't, if no one raises their hand in 10 seconds, I'm gonna like pray. Yeah, Tommy. (indistinct) Although, the curriculum? Okay. (indistinct) >> So, this is what your children are going to be getting sent home. It's going to be on the Facebook page. Here's lesson one. I'm going to scroll up.</p><p>It's just an overview of Philippians. So we're looking at like just Paul's journey in Acts 16 to how the church in Philippi gets started with an outline. Most worksheets are going to be four pages, but because this is an overview, I felt like our kids needed to get a little bit of context.</p><p>So the workbook instructions, they're going to be asked to read an assigned passage, read over the prep questions, read over the discussion questions mentally, and/or write down the answers for Sunday and review the memory verse. And then here, this is what the curriculum's going to look like, chapter one, verses one to two, lesson one.</p><p>Remember the last time you wrote a warm, love-filled letter to someone? It probably started with an affectionate "Dear" blank or a resounding "Hello," et cetera, et cetera. So this was a letter from Paul with different translations. Oops, see, this changed. This is the Word document. I have a PDF.</p><p>It's fine. But who sent the letter? What title did they give themselves with the discussion of what a doulos is, a bond servant? If you guys haven't picked up on it, in Acts 16, the slave girl follows him around calling "Douloy, douloy, douloy." And so Paul, this is the only other letter outside of Titus where he writes "bond servants." And so I thought that was interesting.</p><p>So this is going to be just a little discussion on that. And then discussion questions, describing your own words, what a slave does, how he serves, lives, what is a saint, okay? Looking at the past context of a slave, how would you define grace and peace in your own words?</p><p>And then discussion questions. When we become Christians, we are automatically given the title and rights of sons and daughters, prince and heir. Will we also inherit the title doulos of Jesus Christ? How do these titles affect the way we can and ought to live? So just questions for our children, regardless of their age.</p><p>So our kindergarten teachers are not going to whip these questions to class. So our kindergarten teachers are actually very good at contextualizing for their age. They'll probably take one question and go off that for the whole hour and then do show and tell and then eat snacks, okay? So depending on the age, they will go either very deep or just light, okay?</p><p>So you as a parent, when you see this at home, you didn't go through, the teacher didn't go through every single question. And it is not homework. Some overachieving church parents, so that their child never flunks church, they do all of this. And we're so blessed by that, but that is not necessarily holiness, nor is that required from our church.</p><p>This is a benefit and a resource for you, not something that we're going to check, okay? So you're going to be the one checking. And then a memory verse, Galatians 2 20, and that's just our first lesson. And all the other lessons are going to be four pages with the same format.</p><p>Text, question, question, discussion, memory verse. And so I don't know how long I can keep this up, but we'll try to figure this out. Because our education department, one thing that we don't have in modern day Christendom is Bible-based curriculum for children that just, because it's a lot of topic-based stuff.</p><p>And it's not too early to start them on inductive study and focus on just the word of God. And I'm assuming you guys would agree with that. It's just, there's no way we can produce curriculum that is age appropriate for every age. So as of right now, until we deem that this is not practical, we'll just keep it this way.</p><p>But thank you, Tommy. So this is the curriculum. I have it done for Philippians. This was easy because I did this with our Berean students a decade ago. So I just edited it and modified it and updated it a little bit. So hopefully we can do this. Yes? Is it going to be passed out with the children or?</p><p>It's going to be passed out to your children who are in Sprouts and Youth, not the seats. I didn't, like, get to the school time. But then some parents, some of the kids are going to need it for their class. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yes? So the seats are still safe and I didn't order them for the same.</p><p>Right. So we're teaching out of the NASB, but as you guys can see on this thing, we're using what basically are, like, the whole gamut of our church uses, well, ESV, NIV, NASB. I don't know what other translations are commonly used, but these are the most common ones. So all the pastors are teaching out of the NAS, but for the NAS, for children, it is very difficult to read.</p><p>But we understand that. But a lot of that is we want to help them read it and then help them read it rather than just make a children's interpretation of it. So we'll see how it goes. Our memory versus we've heard it's very wooden in the NAS, but as of right now, I think we'll try it.</p><p>And if we need to adjust it and if you guys, like, throw a hissy fit and just have a mass, like, complaint, "We bring back NIV," or something, then we will possibly say no. But we'll figure it out. Yeah. For Cs, it'll be NIV and then NAS. We do, we did have, we purchased some NASB children's Bibles, which they came out with.</p><p>It's just pictures. It's just, it's nothing different. But we are going to try to keep with the NASB, but use all three of the commonly used translations. >> Does the stuff allow you to memorize it? >> Of course. Yeah. So the kids can memorize in the NIV. But just for uniformity's sake, we'll say we're going to use NAS.</p><p>Good question. Anybody else? Yes, Marsha. >> So for the high schoolers, the fact that you can tell if they're at least one grade from the 7.0, does that mean they're going to take it home? >> Yes. So they're doing this in class. Obviously they're not going to be able to do all of it.</p><p>So they are going to take it home. But my hope is that, see, biblical information dispensation is not our job. Ours is to see what their heart's needs are. And though the platform is this text, if in the class our student has like an important issue, if they get stuck on if God is sovereign, how can he allow A, B, and C, I want to encourage our teachers, it's okay to put the text aside a little bit, have them do it at home, but really address the student's question.</p><p>Because those are valid questions. And so, yeah, we don't ever want to be like, what do we do in class? So it's -- but it usually, like, if they pay attention in class, usually it's done. This is eight pages because it's the overview. Usually it's just four. And it's just usually two pages of activity and study.</p><p>And then the first and last page are not -- you go through it real quick. Anybody else? Yes. Oh, that's a good question. If you have a question for your department or your teachers, who do we ask? So our point person for our seeds is Sarah. Our sprouts is Gloria Choi.</p><p>She's not here. Gloria Choi. And our youth group is going to be Ryan Chang. I'll actually -- I'll include that on the slide. Sarah, Gloria, and Ryan are our main contact people for the parents to -- and if you shoot me an email, I'm not going to, like, look -- like, just be judgmental.</p><p>I'll just forward it to them. But they're your people. Ideally, the less I am directly involved in any of the departments, the more effective I will be able to minister as a pastor. So our goal is to set this up for five years ahead. And so like I shared before, we do need a lot of your patience.</p><p>We do need a lot of your help to set up something where even, like I -- even if we don't add a new family, our church gets big. And that's a challenge. And space becomes a problem. And so it's -- we're trying to do this to set it up so that we can sustain this long term.</p><p>So -- but for now, I mean, those are the people. Maybe one or two more questions. Yes, Janet. >> When do you move up the church? >> Ah, good question. September 1st, everything happens. Everything is changing. And it's a Sunday. So I will officially start in the youth group September 1st.</p><p>Nobody's moving up, actually, to the youth group. But our kindergarteners will, like, come in to our sprouts for the first time on September 1st. And we'll have things September 1st, usually till August of the following year. Any other questions? Pray for us. I think there's a feeling of being overwhelmed in all the teachers and feeling of, like, what do we do?</p><p>There's a lot of work to be done. And so right now, it's our transition stage. And so please pray for us. And if you guys want to know what our prayer requests are, you can ask. But ultimately, we want to build a church as a whole that really honors God, honors his word, and really focuses on just disciple making here and abroad.</p><p>And so whatever our role can be with our children, we'll try to have that same vision, okay? Cater to the younger kids. All right? If you have any more questions, please just email somebody. Or I mean, you can email me. And we'll go from there. All right? We're only going to have these parents meetings maybe once a year.</p><p>So you guys, I don't like meetings. And I don't like long meetings. And so that's probably good news. So if you don't have a Facebook, you're going to be out of the loop. If you want to just set one up and then just say, like, Mickey Mouse, and then you email me and be like, this is Tim Irving.</p><p>But I put Mickey Mouse. Right? We'll just secretly add you on the slide. All right? And then we will not tell anybody who Mickey Mouse is. Okay? So, but we do need, like, because there is, all the other channels are very difficult for us to just organize and, you guys understand, right?</p><p>So if you don't have Facebook and you don't want to get it, and that's fine. But just remind us to remind you via email. All right? So yeah. We'll dismiss. Let me pray for us. And then we'll dismiss this PowerPoint. And this first lesson, I will put on the family ministry page.</p><p>Okay? So you could just kind of check it out. Okay? Lord, we thank you for just your kindness to our church. I pray that our church will not become an idol, that our children will not become our life's purpose, but that we would all face in the same direction, that we would all seek to build your church, whether we're seven or 70.</p><p>So I pray for your help just to be able to discern what is practical and what is godly, to help us to discern what is good from what is better, and help us to really work toward enabling and equipping our children to fight battles in a godly and an effective way.</p><p>And Lord, we need help. They need help. And Lord God, we pray that you would raise up just men and women of faith through this church as you see me pray. Amen. All right.</p></div></body></html>
