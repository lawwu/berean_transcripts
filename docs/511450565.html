wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=19">00:00:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">clarify that the Bible study going forward, this recording will not be the Bible study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=27">00:00:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This recording is just going to be highlighting, maybe giving some pointers, just kind of help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=33">00:00:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">wrap things up, but if you rely on this to do your Bible study, you're not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=39">00:00:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">able to participate in what's happening in the home groups or the small groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=45">00:00:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We want the church to be able to be truly Bereans, not Berean as members, obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=50">00:00:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about Acts 17 and 11 where they examined everything to see if they were from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=56">00:00:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">God's Word, to test everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=59">00:00:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in order to do that, we can't just accept doctrine and say what's biblical and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=65">00:01:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not biblical because it makes sense to us or doesn't make sense to us, or you trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=69">00:01:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one leader over another leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=71">00:01:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Our confidence really needs to be from God's Word, and the only way to ensure that is if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=77">00:01:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">every Christian knows what the Word of God says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=81">00:01:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want everyone to come to Bible study, committed to do inductive Bible study, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=87">00:01:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to attend Bible study, but to committed to study and to be able to dig and ask questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=92">00:01:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it may be a little bit more tedious, it may require a little bit more work on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=97">00:01:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">part, but again, God has invested and ordained His very breath, according to God's Word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=105">00:01:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into His Word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=107">00:01:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is not possible to know God without committing to know His Word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=113">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so much you can learn from sermons, from experience, when you don't fully grasp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=121">00:02:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">His heart in what He intended in His Word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=125">00:02:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, all of this is to just encourage you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=128">00:02:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're in the habit of just attending Bible study, to really commit to do the inductive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=134">00:02:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=136">00:02:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at first, just again as a wrap up, and I'm not going to be pointing to every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=143">00:02:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">single part of the text, but just kind of give you a highlight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=147">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we talked about in 1 Thessalonians, it's good to know the background behind Silvanus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=154">00:02:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and Timothy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=156">00:02:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So don't skim over the introduction, because there's a lot in there that kind of helps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=160">00:02:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you to understand the mindset of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=164">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So knowing Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, their relationship, who they are, how old are they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=169">00:02:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">why did they join?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=171">00:02:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Silvanus joined for the second missionary journey along with Timothy, but Timothy was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=175">00:02:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a lifelong companion ever since he met him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=179">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And Silvanus was a peer of Paul that was sent with him to give the letter to the Gentile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=186">00:03:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">churches that they didn't have to be circumcised to become Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=192">00:03:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the greetings, "Grace to you and peace."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=195">00:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we learned last time that the term "grace" was a common greeting from the Greek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=199">00:03:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">world, and "peace," "shalom," was a common greeting from the Jewish world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=207">00:03:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So Apostle Paul has created a unique greeting with a combination of the Gentile world and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=214">00:03:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the Jewish world, "grace" and "peace."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=216">00:03:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But along with that, even the greeting in itself contains the gospel message, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=224">00:03:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Jews were constantly looking for peace, for "shalom" from God, and the only way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=228">00:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to get that was from grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=231">00:03:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so even in the very introduction, "grace and peace to you," is pretty much a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=238">00:03:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">summary of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=240">00:04:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In verse 1 and 2, asking a lot of questions is helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=248">00:04:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What I highlighted here is the preposition "in" and "from."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=252">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something that I noticed that even as I was preparing this video, I looked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=258">00:04:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this text so many times throughout the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=260">00:04:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I've probably done inductive bio-study in 1st and 2nd Thessalonians probably over a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=265">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dozen times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=267">00:04:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But for whatever reason, I've always asked the question, "to the church of the Thessalonians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=272">00:04:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=274">00:04:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says the same thing again, "grace to you and peace from God the Father and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=277">00:04:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=280">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And why is it here, "in God the Father" and here, "from God the Father?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=286">00:04:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I realized that what he was saying here is not Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=294">00:04:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is "in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=296">00:04:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">He was actually saying, "to the church of the Thessalonians, in God our Father and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=301">00:05:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord Jesus Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=302">00:05:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I don't know if you missed this, but I definitely did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=307">00:05:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That he's basically saying that the Thessalonians who are "in God the Father," and then he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=312">00:05:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">saying "we're bringing grace to you from God the Father."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=316">00:05:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So even in the introduction, Apostle Paul basically is acknowledging that all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=322">00:05:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is because of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=325">00:05:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He's sending greetings from God the Father to the church who is "in God the Father."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=332">00:05:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this sovereignty of God, that all of this is happening because of what God is doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=338">00:05:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in their midst.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=339">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why it leads to the second part of it, where he's compelled to give thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=343">00:05:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it may be a simple introduction, but even in the simple introduction, it kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=348">00:05:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of gives us the theological mindset of the author and how that affects his perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=354">00:05:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on all these different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=357">00:05:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, in verse 3 and 4, I did the sentence structure for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=365">00:06:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, get in the habit of dividing each verse into main parts of the speech and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=372">00:06:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are supporting phrases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=375">00:06:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll kind of help you to focus in on the study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=377">00:06:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at verse 3, it says "we ought always to give thanks," which is the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=382">00:06:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">phrase here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=383">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then why does he give thanks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=386">00:06:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if your faith is being enlarged and love for each one of you grows ever greater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=391">00:06:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the main thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=393">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could make this sentence without these fillers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=398">00:06:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Where like, who are you giving thanks to God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=400">00:06:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's fitting and because of faith, love toward one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=406">00:06:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see the main parts of the speech, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=409">00:06:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then focus on these as supporting what he's saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=413">00:06:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So giving thanks because of their faith and because of love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=417">00:06:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And same thing with verse 4, it says "we speak proudly of you for their perseverance and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=424">00:07:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">their faith," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=426">00:07:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here it describes their perseverance and faith in the midst of persecution and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=431">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">affliction, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=433">00:07:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Here it says "we speak proudly of you to the other churches."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

and that's kind of like your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=471">00:07:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">first line after you've done the

Thessalonians was a model church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=495">00:08:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=507">00:08:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at 1 Corinthians 1, verse 4, Apostle Paul also has a couple of verses</span></div><div

one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=524">00:08:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">harshest letters that Apostle Paul

even when there is struggle, persecution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=549">00:09:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and affliction going on, that his thankfulness is not necessarily just because he sees that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=555">00:09:15.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=694">00:11:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when he is writing this letter, humanly speaking, you would think that there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=699">00:11:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of frustrations and things being poured out in these letters.</span></div><div

going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=707">00:11:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=715">00:11:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=966">00:16:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever you do a large chunk like this, it's helpful to, again, to break it down into</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=996">00:16:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once you've identified that, then you can go back from verse to verse and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1000">00:16:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ask the question, do the observations cross references.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1003">00:16:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you have a larger text that you're dealing with, before you do verse by verse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1009">00:16:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure you get the complete thought flow that's going on

other study that you will do in more detail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1019">00:16:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">will be

do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1025">00:17:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And no matter what you do, you can't speed up your

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/511450565&t=1037">00:17:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll be able to get all these insights.</span></div><div
