the Passion Week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1947">00:32:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And from Palm Sunday to Tuesday, Jesus and his disciples spent a lot of time each day at the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1955">00:32:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of teaching that's taking place on these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1958">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you may have noticed as you've read through the passages, today's is a little shorter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1963">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Traditionally and historically, Wednesday of the Passion Week has been called Silent Wednesday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1970">00:32:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Silent because the scripture doesn't say much about Wednesday outside of the preparations being made for the Passover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1978">00:32:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And while Jesus and his disciples remain in Bethany for a last time of fellowship and perhaps some additional teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1985">00:33:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Judas returns alone to Jerusalem to arrange the betrayal of Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1992">00:33:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the scripture suggests that Judas was often sent out on errands as a group's treasurer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=1998">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So none of the disciples probably thought much of his absence on that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2003">00:33:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to read Luke 22, 1 through 6 for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2009">00:33:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2015">00:33:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death, for they were afraid of the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2021">00:33:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the Twelve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2029">00:33:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2036">00:33:56.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">So he consented and he began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them, apart from the crowd."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2048">00:34:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we see Satan at work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2051">00:34:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in verse 3, we actually have a very scary verse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2055">00:34:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan himself enters into Judas, one of the Twelve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2061">00:34:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the chief priests and scribes, now they have a willing inside man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2067">00:34:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They did not have to do any work to lure or to bribe any of the disciples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2072">00:34:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the disciples took the initiative to come to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2077">00:34:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an arrangement was made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2079">00:34:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Judas Iscariot, a disciple who had been handpicked by the Lord Jesus himself, was going to commit the biggest act of betrayal in the history of humankind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2090">00:34:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you think about this, this seems almost absurd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2098">00:34:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How could someone in such close proximity to Jesus turn on him in such a way?</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2113">00:35:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because how sinister, how evil, how foolish this man must have been to do such a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2121">00:35:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And on this silent Wednesday, we're going to be spending some time looking at what the gospel accounts say about Judas Iscariot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2129">00:35:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So well, one, Judas had stuck with Jesus when most of the crowds, including those who had been called followers and disciples, had turned away from him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2141">00:35:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you read John 6, the narrative where Jesus said that he was the bread of life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2146">00:35:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he told the crowds that he was the destination and not just the means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2151">00:35:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and in him was life, in him was eternal life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2154">00:35:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was eternal life, and he didn't come to fill their bellies or to overthrow the Roman government and make their lives easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2162">00:36:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus preached in John 6 that he was God incarnate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2167">00:36:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this could not have but sounded super blasphemous to the people that were there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2174">00:36:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was crazy talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2177">00:36:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And understandably, many of the people were incredulous, and Jesus' teachings started getting very hard to listen to and to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2188">00:36:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at these hard teachings, most of the crowds started to withdraw, and they stopped walking with Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2196">00:36:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Judas remained with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2202">00:36:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me read for you the end portion of John 6, 66 to 69.</span></div><div class="c"><span

to go away also, do you?'</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGGFX9g91uc&t=2222">00:37:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Simon Peter answered him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go?
