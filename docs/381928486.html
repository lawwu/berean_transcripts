gods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=9s">00:00:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not going to stray from that main point at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=13s">00:00:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's going to be five points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=16s">00:00:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">For those of you who need everything kind of planned out in front of you, out of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=18s">00:00:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">five points, the first one is going to be the longest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=21s">00:00:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So halfway through the sermon, if you're kind of getting nervous that we're going a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=24s">00:00:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">time, the last four will go a lot quicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=26s">00:00:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one we're going to be spending a lot of time in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=29s">00:00:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that first point is this though, that He is sovereign over kingdoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=33s">00:00:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That's our first point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=34s">00:00:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He is sovereign over kingdoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=38s">00:00:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now as we look at the text in Isaiah, what we see is that there's a lot of historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=44s">00:00:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">things going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=45s">00:00:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's Israel, and Israel has been at this point in history separated from North</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=50s">00:00:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and South.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=51s">00:00:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Northern Kingdom is called Israel and the Southern Kingdom is called Judah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=55s">00:00:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There's 10 tribes up North, 2 tribes down South.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=59s">00:00:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As you see this, we can see through the unfurling message of scripture that God has been sovereignly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=67s">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">working in His people, Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=69s">00:01:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been moving them, He's been kind of taking them in and out, and a lot of it had to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=76s">00:01:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with their obedience to Him, their obedience to His covenant promises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=81s">00:01:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're familiar with Leviticus chapter 26 or Deuteronomy chapter 28, we see a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=85s">00:01:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=86s">00:01:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "If you obey my commands, if you love me, if you follow after me, then I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=92s">00:01:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bring to you prosperity and success."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=94s">00:01:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "However, if you disobey, if you are not faithful to me, if you are adulterous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=98s">00:01:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">against me, then you will find my calamity."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=102s">00:01:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's how it's been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=104s">00:01:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been sovereignly working in His people, in His nation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=109s">00:01:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically in this time of Isaiah, we find that the tribes have already split.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=115s">00:01:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in this split, what we see, yes, is Israel's unfaithfulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=121s">00:02:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why there's a split with the 10 and the 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=124s">00:02:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What we also see in the midst of this historical fact, though, is that God's preserving, gracious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=130s">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and merciful hand is continuing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=133s">00:02:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">From the time man falls, God has been promising over and over again that a Messiah is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=138s">00:02:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to come, that He is going to send the anointed, chosen one to save His people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=144s">00:02:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that, Isaiah was written in 740 BC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=149s">00:02:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It was written to the southern kingdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=151s">00:02:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the middle of this preaching that Isaiah does, because it does encompass a few decades,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=159s">00:02:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the middle of his preaching, what he's saying is, "The northern kingdom is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=162s">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to fall."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=163s">00:02:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he tells this to the southern kingdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=165s">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"A foreign nation is going to come and take you over, and that foreign nation is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=169s">00:02:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to be Assyria."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=171s">00:02:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the northern kingdom was meant to be a case study to the southern kingdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=175s">00:02:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That the southern kingdom is going to see the northern kingdom fall, see God's sovereign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=180s">00:03:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">hand at work, that if we are unfaithful to God's covenant promise, then He will do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=185s">00:03:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sovereignly, according to what He sees fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=189s">00:03:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the reason why we're talking about this is because we see God's sovereignty clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=194s">00:03:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at work with

sovereignty, God's sovereign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=202s">00:03:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hand at work in foreign

around 740, and it spans through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=211s">00:03:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the captivity of the northern

Assyria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/381928486#t=216s">00:03:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the southern kingdom witnesses this.</span></div><div
