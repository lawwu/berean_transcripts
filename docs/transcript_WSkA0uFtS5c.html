This is also called Maundy Thursday. And we continue to see a deliberate nature of both Jesus's actions and his teachings. There's a lot that happens on this final day, but we can break it up into three major chunks.</p><p>The first is that it's the season of the Passover. The second is that there's this thing called the upper room discourse. And third and finally, it's that Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. These are the events that occur on this Thursday. To look at the first, it's the season of the Passover.</p><p>We see a continuing theme of everything being preordained. There's this room that's previously and deliberately prepared for Jesus and his disciples. In this time, prophecy after prophecy is being fulfilled during this Passion Week. And we see God's continuing deliberate action. We saw this past Sunday that there's this donkey that was prepared for Jesus.</p><p>And we see that even in this last Passover meal, everything completely planned out. If you could turn with me in your Bibles to Mark chapter 14 verse 12. It says here in this text, "On the first day of unleavened bread, "when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, "his disciples said to him, "Where do you want us to go "and prepare for you to eat the Passover?</p><p>"And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man will meet you "carrying a pitcher of water. "Follow him, and wherever he enters, "say to the owner of the house, "The teacher says, where is my guest room "in which I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</p><p>"And he himself will show you a large upper room "furnished and ready. "Prepare for us there. "The disciples went out and came to the city "and found it just as he had told them, "and they prepared the Passover." So everything here, Jesus knew. He knew the city. He knew there was gonna be a man they would encounter.</p><p>He knew what the man would be doing. He knew that this man would go back to another man who would have this room, an owner of a home that had this upper room prepared for them. He knew that specifically, this man would have prepared it for the Lord and his disciples.</p><p>And in verse 16 there, if you look at that again, it's a note of finality and definiteness. "The disciples went out and came to the city "and found it just as he had told them." Not a thing missing from what he prophesied. Jesus' knowledge wasn't vague. It wasn't a vague, I'll die for sin.</p><p>It was actually quite detailed. Everything he did was deliberate. And we see this theme continuing to play out throughout the entirety of this week. And into this Passover meal, which is now popularly called the Last Supper. See, the room was not the only thing deliberately prepared for them. That was only one scene or one cut or one little area, one day, that was prepared.</p><p>God has a plan for every minute detail. Every scene falls under a sovereign and definite plan. Even the entirety of the Passover, thousands of years running, has been deliberately prepared for the coming of this Jesus. It's not simply that Jesus came to fulfill what God said would happen. It's that Jesus was the whole and entire purpose of all of it.</p><p>And these signs were created in the past, impatient, waiting for Jesus to finally come. Soon, the Passover meal, though, was something the Israelites simply did. But every time, every year as the Passover came and went, it was completely created and purposed with the intention of waiting and preparing for the coming of the Messiah.</p><p>Tragically, the Jews are still practicing it today. If you look at John 5:37, it says, "And the Father who sent me, he has testified of me. "You have neither heard his voice at any time "nor seen his form. "You do not have his word abiding in you, "for you do not believe him whom he sent." And here it is in verse 39, you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life.</p><p>It is these that testify about me, and you are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life. If you hop down to verse 45, he continues, "Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. "The one who accuses you is Moses, "in whom you have set your hope.</p><p>"For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, "for he wrote about me." He's saying all of these things written in scripture have been deliberately planned out for his coming. And that included this Passover. And what was this Passover? The Passover, as many of you may know, was an event that occurred during the days of Moses and the Egyptian pharaoh.</p><p>Yahweh God was on his way to freeing his people from Egypt, and he used these 10 plagues to force his hand. In the 10th and final plague, God sent an angel of death to kill every firstborn, that's important, every firstborn son of Egypt. However, he commanded the Israelites to do something on that evening.</p><p>He would not simply spare the Israelites' firstborn sons. He told them, "You would have to slaughter "a one-year-old male lamb for each household, "and paint the blood of that lamb "over the doorposts of the house." And in this way, if for those who followed that command, for those who placed their faith in what he was saying, the angel of death would pass over their house, hence the name Passover.</p><p>In Exodus 12, verse four, he includes an interesting detail regarding this Passover. "Now if the household is too small for a lamb, "then he and his neighbor nearest to his house "are to take one according to the number of persons in them. "According to what each man should eat, "you are to divide the lamb." See, this lamb was important not only for the blood that was supposed to be displayed or painted over the doorposts of the house, but the flesh of the lamb must also be consumed by the individuals.</p><p>And in it, God's wrath would pass over those individuals who had both the flesh and the blood of the lamb covering over them. You see, for thousands of years, Jews had been practicing this tradition. The slaughtering of lambs and goats and animals during these holidays and festivals were incredible to think about.</p><p>See, countless animals were slaughtered over thousands of years. And with this in mind, Jesus institutes what we now know as the first communion, which was the Last Supper. This is what the disciples would have been thinking when they thought over the Passover meal. They would think about the time in Egypt.</p><p>They would think about the angel of death and the blood of the lamb and the eating of this slaughtered lamb. And Jesus, just like he has been saying about so many things, even on Sundays, as we've been looking over the I Am statements, Jesus is saying, it's not the bread, it's not the water, it's not these signs that you see, but it's me.</p><p>He says, I'm the point of it all. And the same with the Passover. He's saying the Passover was about me. There is now no need for the Passover meal, for I have come. There is no more looking at the shadow, the substance is here. There is no more looking at the sign, he is here.</p><p>He's saying to everybody, I've arrived. After thousands of years of waiting, he's saying, here I am. And so in Mark 14, 22, on this Passover night, it says in scripture, while they were eating, he took some bread and after a blessing, he broke it and gave it to them and said, take it.</p><p>This is my body. And when he had taken a cup and given thanks, he gave it to them and they all drank from it and he said to them, this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. It mimics the Passover. He says, eat my body, drink my blood.</p><p>He is here to be the final Passover lamb. None of the Passover lambs in the past was actually something that would save them. It was all to point to him, the only one who could save. And that is why John the Baptist, when he first saw Jesus, he said, behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.</p><p>This brings us to our second part of this evening, the upper room discourse. Now this upper room is where they've been sharing in this last supper. This upper room discourse is happening concurrently with this meal. So it's all wrapped up together. And the teaching he does with his disciples in this upper room points to himself again.</p><p>If you could turn with me to John chapter 13. Very familiar passage, but it's important to remember that this is during the same time as this last supper, the day before he would die. In John 13 three, Jesus, knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come forth from God and was going back to God, got up from supper and laid aside his garments and making a towel, he girded himself.</p><p>Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. So he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet? And Jesus answered and said to him, what I do you do not realize now, but you will understand hereafter.</p><p>Peter said to him, never shall you wash my feet. Jesus answered him, if I do not wash you, you have no part with me. Simon Peter said to him, Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head. And Jesus said to him, he who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean.</p><p>And you are clean, but not all of you. Jumping down to verse 12. So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and reclined at the table again, he said to them, do you know what I have done to you? You call me teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</p><p>If I then, the Lord and the teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you. But Jesus is setting this example for them. He's saying, I am your teacher, I am your Lord, and yet I am stooping down, humbly washing your feet, doing the action of a slave.</p><p>What we see in John 13, we have to remember, we can't get lost staring at the sign. We have to stare at Christ here. We can't be staring at the pointing finger, we have to stare at what it's pointing at. The significance of the feet washing will be realized only after Jesus dies for them.</p><p>Remember what Jesus says in John 13, eight. He says, if I don't wash you, you have no part with me. He's not talking about the washing of their feet. Jesus is showing that he must cleanse them of their sins, or they can't be with him. This isn't a sermon illustration of how we must serve one another.</p><p>This is a picture of only what Jesus could do for us. This is a picture of only what can be described as the creator kneeling before creation. That the Lord Jesus himself would kneel down before the people serving them. In Philippians chapter two, verses five through eight, remember this image.</p><p>Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant, being made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.</p><p>The picture being burned into the memories of these disciples is their master kneeling down to do the work of a slave. And this picture was what was extravagant enough, but what it points at is infinitely more extravagant. We stare at what Jesus is trying to portray here, what he's trying to depict, that even here in fulfilling the Passover and instituting this Lord's Supper, the first communion, he continues to point to what he will do, to show exactly what he was going to do the very next day.</p><p>Remember the words of Matthew and Mark, the son of man came not to be served, but to serve. That's great, but the next part is so much more important than that. To give his life as a ransom for many, it describes how his service looked. To lay down his life, he came not to be served, but to serve, that's how he serves.</p><p>Remember what John says later in 1 John 3.16, we know, loved by this, that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. That's the example portion. So in John 13.34, when he says in this upper room discourse, a new commandment I give to you, which is where we get the word mandi, that means command, a new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</p><p>By this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another. We don't stare at the directive, we ought to love one another. We stare at our Lord and Savior, our God, our King, our Maker, the creator Jesus Christ, on his knees, washing our feet, showing us how he will in just a few days die, resurrect so that we might have life.</p><p>This was God in heaven, born in the form of a servant as a man, dying the criminal's death on the cross, complete humility, complete degradation, and a debasement, saying that he would take our place. The point wasn't that he washed their feet. The point is that he washed us of our sin.</p><p>And he as God was stooping before these disciples in unthinkable humility. Simon Peter bursts up at that and says, "You can't wash my feet." He did so much more. This was the Passover lamb giving himself, laying down his life. In the middle of this discourse, do you know what the disciples were fighting over?</p><p>They were fighting over who would get to sit in the place of honor and exaltation. And here's Jesus stooping and kneeling. And so with his heart set, Jesus prays the high priestly prayer, intentionally in front of his disciples, which we see in John 14 through 17. And then Jesus gets up, and with his disciples they head to the Garden of Gethsemane, now numbering only 11 of them, as Pastor Peter talked about Judas last night, who left.</p><p>This brings us to our third point, in the Garden of Gethsemane, this last part of Thursday, as deliberate as everything has been in Jesus' life to this point, Jesus goes into this garden to pray. And it's a reminder that Jesus was human. He felt the strong pains of temptation and desires to perhaps live for himself.</p><p>That was probably still there. He had every reason to sit there and say, why must I do this? For people who are undeserving, for people who are enemies, for people who are Judas-like, as we learned last night. To escape what was awaiting him, there was no reason. Jesus walks over to the Garden of Gethsemane, where there are groves of olive trees.</p><p>Gethsemane means olive press. And here he leaves eight disciples at the entrance of the garden, and he heads in with three of them. It's Peter, James, and John. And he leaves Peter, James, and John to pray, and he goes a little bit deeper into the garden to pray alone.</p><p>We see this in Matthew 26, if you could turn there. Matthew chapter 26, verse 36. And it says there, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed. Then he said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.</p><p>"Remain here and keep watch with me." And he went a little beyond them, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. "Yet not as I will, but as you will." You know the story. I mean, Jesus was grieved, and he was distressed.</p><p>This is someone who is alarmed, someone who has a heart that's heavy and weighty. Jesus was full of fear and trepidation here. I mean, this is Jesus who has never really feared anything. He could look at the winds and the waves in the middle of a storm in the Mediterranean, without fear.</p><p>Someone who could stare down a disease, someone who could look at death and bring to life, someone not afraid to go against the religious leaders. And here he is, in the middle of this garden, deeply, deeply distressed, alone, in a pit, in darkness, with the walls closing around him, about to face an eternal, mountainous wrath of God, unleashed upon him.</p><p>I mean, I remember what it was like to fear hell. And I no longer need to feel that fear any longer. But here is my Lord and my Savior, just in deep distress, looking down the barrel of God's wrath. So he asked Peter and James and John to pray with him, as he goes deeper into the garden.</p><p>And he took these three, because perhaps he had more intimate relationships with them. I think that these three were actually the leaders of the disciples. And we know what happens next. Three times, Jesus asks God for something. And each time, he comes back to see that they'd fallen asleep in prayer.</p><p>And this might have been up to three hours of agonizing prayer for Christ. At this point, we might conclude that God the Father was silent at Jesus' prayers and pleas. Maybe that's why Jesus repeats this prayer three times. Well, in Matthew 26, verse 39, if you look a little further, we see his first request, in verse 39.</p><p>My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not as I will, but as you will. This is his plea. But in his second request, it's very enlightening. In verse 42, plea number two. My Father, this cannot pass away unless I drink it. Your will be done.</p><p>Is Jesus asking the Father to stop this from actually occurring? Is he asking God the Father to stop him from being crucified and to stop him from drinking every drop of the wrath of God? Jesus knows what he's there for. He knows what he's going to do. His entire human life has been leading deliberately to this point.</p><p>All of human history has been pointing to this instance in history. His prayer all night long was his passionate plea, found in his present distress, followed though by this resolve. Let your will be done. The Son's will was always the Father's will. They were one and the same. Jesus did not live his life for himself.</p><p>He lived his entire life to be a sacrifice for others. He would give his life so that others may find life. And we see what the writer of Hebrews says about Jesus' prayer in the garden. I think that's what it's pointing to. In Hebrews chapter five, verse seven, in the days of his flesh, Jesus, or he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the one able to save him from death.</p><p>And he was heard because of his piety. I think that the Father definitely heard Jesus. We get another glimpse in the differing account. Matthew and Mark look similar, but Luke's account looks a little different. There's a one little thing that comes out in Luke 22, verse 42. Here's the account in Luke.</p><p>Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me, yet not my will, but yours be done. And then in verse 43, now an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he was praying very fervently, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground.</p><p>See, the Father heard his Son. But like it says in Isaiah 53, four, of Jesus, the Father's will and the Son's will were in alignment. They knew what the job was here. They knew what the mission was here. In Isaiah 53, four, surely our griefs he himself bore, and our sorrows he carried.</p><p>Yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. And then in verse 10, but the Lord was pleased to crush him, putting him to grief. If he would render himself as a guilt offering. It says that Jesus is in grief. It says that Jesus is distressed. It says that he is so distressed that he is sweating and crying blood.</p><p>He bore our griefs. He carried our sorrows. God crushed him, putting him to grief. The Father heard, yet the Father and Son had the same will this evening. They knew what the end was. It was to fulfill the Passover that we might have death pass over us with the body and the blood of the Son given for us.</p><p>It was to fulfill a Christ act of service and love that the one true creator, that the one true God who made all of the world, the Lord and the King, the exalted one, the majestic, that he would give himself for humanity, to stoop down in humility, that in his service we might be washed of sin, that he would taste death so that we would not have to.</p><p>So tomorrow we'll see a time where Jesus cries out on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" As he drinks every drop of that cup. But tonight is not that time. Tonight in this incredible grief and distress and anguish that we see with Jesus, he knew what he must do.</p><p>Jesus was resolute, he was convicted, and even in the silence of that garden, an angel came to strengthen him with resolve to know what he came here to do deliberately. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I pray that as we are now right at the precipice of Good Friday, that we see what Jesus had been doing.</p><p>Oh, Father, thank you. Thank you for our wonderful Savior. Thank you, God, that he did not have to walk this path and yet he had every intention to do this. That he walked deliberately, with purpose and with conviction. And as we see in Hebrews 12 too, that he did it for the joy laid before him.</p><p>Oh, Father, there is no one like you. We worship you with all our hearts. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
