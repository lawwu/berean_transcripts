So that was just a brief video. We have actually a great relationship with our neighbor right across the street. They've been very generous in letting us use the spot. But I know it's convenient to walk across that grass, but they've made a special request to stay off that.</p><p>And they're actually renewing a lot of their lawn and stuff. So please make sure. Just make your walk around, etc. And then, you know, let's stop. So a couple of announcements for us with a lot of things happening in the near season. As the Passion Week is approaching, the outreach team is having some extra opportunities to go out and evangelize.</p><p>So we'll be going to the nearby Irvine spectrum on Saturday, the 12th and the 19th at 1 p.m. You can sign up for that and come out with us to share the gospel, invite people to church. So please take advantage of those opportunities. Additionally, on Saturday, April 26th at 9 a.m., we have All Church Cleaning Day.</p><p>So if you're available, please mark that on your calendar. Sign up. We'd love to join together, do spring cleaning, and make sure we take care of the facilities that we have. Also, please note that all members' meeting and service fair is happening May 4th. It's at 2 p.m., so we'll have some short time to go grab—or actually, lunch is going to be—there's going to be a fundraiser lunch that day, so you won't have to go off campus.</p><p>But please make sure to mark that. It's an important time for us to come, and then we'll be having that special service fair outside where you can greet and meet some of the various departments and teams, find out what's going on and how to get involved. Also, there's an open invite to participate in the men's softball tournament that will take place on May 24th.</p><p>So this is a special fundraiser for our missions programs. Please sign up. All skill levels are welcome. We typically have multiple teams, and we'll be competing against other churches. It's a lot of fun. Please make sure to sign up for that. Finally, we have been announcing our all-church retreat, and the registration is now open.</p><p>Just to help you guys out, we actually have a booth set up outside. You probably saw it as you were entering in. After the service, stop by to register you and the whole family. The dates there are August 1st through August 3rd. We're going to be having a great speaker, somebody who's visited us a lot, Pastor Ray Cosley, on the topic of being set apart for his glory.</p><p>So please make sure you sign up for that, and if you have any questions, you can direct them over to Justin. Okay, so after our worship time, today we'll have the privilege of hearing Imogene's testimony and seeing her be baptized. For offering, please do continue to give it digitally, or if you have a check, we have a box right there at the entrance on your way out.</p><p>Let's pray. Our God, we want to take time to thank you. We are so grateful to you. Father, we are in many ways, and in every way, indebted to you. For all that we have, God, you have given to us. I pray, Lord, that in this time as we give to you our worship, our song, God, we would continue to express just how much we love you, and how thankful we are for the lavishing grace you've given.</p><p>Let this time, Father God, be honoring to you, but also nourishing to our soul. From the word that we hear, from the fellowship, from the songs that we sing, we ask, God, that you would bless it. And also, Lord God, the offering that we give. We do pray for it, Lord.</p><p>God, that it would be used for your purposes, that ultimately it would be used for the ministry that is yours and the furthering of your kingdom. We thank you, God, and bless you this morning. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.</p><p>Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us. Let us all rise. Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us. Let us all rise and spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us. Let us all rise and see the neighbors around us.</p><p>Let us all rise and see the neighbors around us. Let us all rise and see the neighbors around us. Let us all rise and see the neighbors around us. Let us all rise and see the neighbors around us. Holy, holy is the Son of God None can stand before His majesty Beautiful beyond our highest love Worthy He is worthy Of glory and honor All power and praise Be to your name Be to your name Be to your name For no one can rival Your glory and faith Be to your glory and faith Be to your name Be to your name Be to your name Be to your name Be to your name Be to your name For no one can rival Your glory and faith Be to your name We lift high the name of Jesus.</p><p>Holy, holy is the Lamb who lived up.

But King David, what did you do?</p><p>Did you listen to Joab? And he says, if you take a look at verse 4. No, nevertheless, my word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. Joab gave the number of the census of all the people of David. In all Israel were a million and a hundred thousand men who drew the sword.</p><p>And Judah was 470,000 men who drew the sword. But he, that's Joab, didn't number Levi and Benjamin among them. Because my commandment was abhorrent to him. Basically, he was doing it, doing it, doing it, and then he stopped. Short of completion. And then I'd be like, whoa, King David.</p><p>That's actually incredible. You had a million five hundred seventy thousand soldiers. We're not talking about just the people in his kingdom. We're talking about military capable fighting men. Maybe not active service, but people who could fight for you. That's crazy! You know? As the podcaster, I would hype him up and be like, oh my gosh!</p><p>You're the man! Because, did you know at that time, Egypt was a superpower. But Egypt was wrought with internal strife. So Egypt, at max during the time of King David, had like a hundred twenty thousand soldiers. A hundred twenty thousand soldiers. A hundred fifty, if that. Egypt was a superpower.</p><p>But Philistia, Aram, all these nations around them, they maybe had seven to ten thousand soldiers. And that would be considered mighty. You know, people are sometimes astounded. Like, Berean's so big now. It's got eleven hundred, twelve hundred, thirteen hundred people. Oh my gosh! Take a moment to think. Not ten times that.</p><p>Not a hundred times that. But over a thousand times that. Of fighting men. This was not just impressive. They eclipsed everybody else. Right? Wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you want to know? Don't you want to see your stat chart? How many soldiers? How many chariots? Right? Sometimes we get so, like, engrossed in our accomplishments.</p><p>It's not even about impressing other people anymore. It's about impressing you. And so we have a situation where it is incredibly impressed. And I would be like, wow! Are you serious? So wait, how many chariots did you have? And King David would be like, hey, hey! Calm down, young man.</p><p>Because God was not impressed. You know? God was not impressed. As a matter of fact. Verse 7. God was so displeased with this thing. He struck Israel. So I said to God, God, I have sinned greatly. In that I have done this thing. But now please take away the iniquity of your servant.</p><p>For I have done very foolishly. King David realized, like, oh my gosh. What did I just do? What did I just do? I sinned. I have offended God. Verse 9. The Lord spoke to Gad, my seer. Gad is the prophet at the time. He is a servant of the king, but a servant of God.</p><p>And he says, go. Speak to David saying, thus says the Lord. I offer you three things. Choose for yourself one of them, which I will do. So Gad came to me. And he said to me, thus says the Lord. Take for yourself either three years of famine. Or three months to be swept away before your foes while the sword of your enemies overtake you.</p><p>Or three days of the sword of the Lord. Even pestilence in the land and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now, therefore, consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me. Oh my gosh, King David. God did one of those things where do you want the belt, the wooden stick, or my hand?</p><p>You know what I mean? God made you choose the instrument of your discipline? Oh my gosh, King David, what did you say? Oh, easy. Three years, three months, three days. You have to take three days. Oh, but wait. It was three years of famine, three years of other nations, or three days of God's hand.</p><p>Oh my gosh, how do you choose? King David, what did you say? Look at what he says. Verse 13. David said to Gad, I am in great distress. The word for distress literally means storm. Imagine a hurricane in his mind and in his heart. The, oh my gosh, you know?</p><p>And he says, please, let me fall into the hand of the Lord. For his mercies are very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man. Wow. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. King David, I'm so glad that you just repented immediately. You said I sinned and you asked God to forgive you.</p><p>Wow. You kind of, you didn't really answer, did you? You didn't answer that trick question. You know what I mean? You just said, God, I trust you. And here I am. I'm going to fall into your hand. That's incredible. And probably King David will say, yeah, you know, whenever we sin, my first inclination is to run away.</p><p>Go hide in my castle, so to speak. But don't. Whenever we sin, brothers and sisters, our first inclination is to run away and hide because we feel ashamed. But let's pray. God, teach me to fall into your hand. For I know that even in the moment of discipline, your mercies are still greater than man's.</p><p>Amen? There is no mercy to be found in your closet. There is no mercy to be found in isolation. You forfeit your relationship with God. When you sin and you think it's better in your shame just to go walk away. You place yourself at the mercy of God. That's what he did.</p><p>Wow. So then what happened, King David? Take a look at verse 14. So the Lord did it. He sent pestilence to Israel. And that day, 70,000 men of Israel died. What? Take a moment to think about that. 70,000 men died. King David was like, go and count them. And then he realized, 70,000.</p><p>Some of you guys are Dodgers fans. And you guys know, at max capacity, how many people can fit into Dodger Stadium? At max, 56,000. Which means you need 20,000 more people. The Lakers Stadium fits a little over 20,000. Think that many people, boom! Die in one swoop. We can't even fathom.</p><p>Verse 15. So God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy it, the Lord saw and was sorry over the calamity and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough! Now relax your hand." And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornion, the Jebusite.</p><p>Take a moment to picture. We're going to get introduced to Ornion, the Jebusite, later. He is just working the field. And standing is an angel. Is he standing next to him? No. Look at this picture. Then I, David, lifted my eyes up and saw the angels of the Lord standing between earth and heaven.</p><p>With his drawn sword and his hands stretched over Jerusalem. So I, David, and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on our faces. Oh! Wow! I can't picture it. God opened your eyes and let you see the angel of destruction. You looked up and all you saw was his leg.</p><p>Because he was so big. You must have been petrified. You must have been scared out of your mind. He had one sword and he was about to destroy your entire city. Everybody you loved. You know, King David, like, we were studying in our Bible study in 1 Samuel 3.</p><p>God had a word of destruction and judgment against Eli. And he said, "I will do my judgment from beginning to end." God did all of it. King David goes, "You're right." There are times when God finishes what he started. And he normally does. But praise God, he relents. Can you imagine if God allowed three full days?</p><p>Can you imagine if God allowed the angel of destruction to go three full days? This was the costliest sin. This was the most deadly sin. I can't even fathom. Oh my gosh. I'm scared out of my mind. What did you do? What did you say? King David goes, "What else could I say?" Verse 16.</p><p>Oh, verse 17, sorry. Verse 17. I said to God, "Is it not I who commanded the count of the people? Indeed, I am the one who sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Oh, Lord, my God, please let your hand be against me and my father's household, but not against your people, that they should be plagued." Wow.</p><p>Again, wow. You... You just took full ownership. You... You didn't blame anybody else. You didn't go, "It was Satan!" And he got into my head and he just moved me to do the stuff. And, you know, and it was joy. I'm that guy. You know, he just didn't blame anybody else.</p><p>And he said, "I confess. I deserve it." You know, brothers and sisters, it is our normal pattern. Sometimes when we sin, I could almost hear it in my head. It's like, "Oh, I'm so frustrated with myself. Normally I'm not like this. And I know I'm better than this. If my circumstances were different.</p><p>And if I had more time. And if I wasn't so tired. And da-da-da-da-da. And da-da-da-da-da-da." And what is that? It's definitely less than full repentance, isn't it? It's not full ownership. What King David is saying, all he's saying is, "I deserved this." As frightening as it may be, I deserved this.</p><p>Not them. So God, again, I placed myself into your hand. Do it to me. That's what he's saying. Wow. So when you confess this way, when you humble yourself, what does God say to you? How does God respond to your confession? Take a look at verse 18. So the angel of the Lord commanded God to say to me that I should go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p><p>He basically said, "Go worship. Go sacrifice." So I went up. I went up at the word of God, which he spoke in the name of the Lord. Now, Ornan turned back and saw the angel. And his four sons who were with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing the wheat.</p><p>So as I came to Ornan, this is verse 21 now. Ornan looked and saw me and went out on the fledgling floor and prostrated himself before me and with his face to the ground. So I said to Ornan, "Give me, please, the site of this threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the Lord.</p><p>For the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be restrained from the people." Ornan said to me, "Take it! Take it for yourself and let my Lord the King do what is good in your sight. See, I will give an oxen for burnt offerings and threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering.</p><p>I'll give it all." Now, just as a quick comic relief. Chapter 24 of 2 Samuel has this exact scenario and exact story, full chapter, giving all the details. But it leaves out the detail that Ornan and his sons saw the angel. So originally when I read 2 Samuel, I was like, "Dang, this guy.</p><p>He has reverence and he loves his king and he's like, "This is my land and this is my livelihood, but take it! You know, take the offering and take the oxen." And then I realized, actually, he and his boys saw the angel. So there's kind of like a comedic scene where they're doing their work and all of a sudden they're like, "Oh my gosh." And his sons are like, "Hiding." And then Ornan's like, "Take it!</p><p>Just do it!" You want the oxen, take it! You want the wheat, take it! You want the tools, do it! Just the wood, everything, just take it! Because he knows what's happening here is King David has to sacrifice to God. If God is not appeased, we're dead. Right? That's the scenario.</p><p>But then take a look. Verse 24. But I said to Ornan, "No. I will surely buy it for full price, for I will not take what is yours for the Lord, or offer a burnt offering which cost me nothing." So I gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site." Okay.</p><p>Let's think about that. Like, dang. Honestly, King David, like, I would have just assumed God's providing. Just like, you show up on scene, he tells you what to do, and he always provides, God's the provider. But you, you stopped and you paid for it. I don't know, is that the right attitude?</p><p>You know, King David, like, sometimes when I read and stuff like that, I've been learning, you can't have a debtor's ethic. You can't be like, "Let me pay God for what I did, I feel so bad." Do you think that's what he's doing? Do you think that's what his attitude is now?</p><p>Trying to pay God? I don't think so. I think King David would say, "Are you kidding me? 70,000 men died." Logically, there's no way we're paying for what just happened. So what is this? You know, when a man gets broken, there's no way to not feel indebted. You can't, like, not feel like you owe God everything.</p><p>I believe what's happening is, he is so contrite, this is true repentance. You know, in 2 Corinthians chapter 7, Scripture tells us that there is two paths. Whenever you sin, we'll all feel sorrow, but there is a sorrow of the world that changes nothing. It doesn't alter your path.</p><p>You're walking down a path of destruction. You'll feel bad, but you keep going there, because nothing's changed. You gave up nothing. You sacrificed nothing. You've answered nothing down your path. But then there is a kind of sorrow that leads to life. And so in 2 Corinthians chapter 7, it says in verse 10, "For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.</p><p>For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow has produced in you. What vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong in everything you demonstrate yourself to be innocent in the matter." King David is actually, truly, sincerely contrite. A moment ago, he's looking, saying, "Look at all I have." And then now he's just like, "This is all yours." Everything in my life.</p><p>I'm not going to conveniently just walk in here. I'm not going to just take it and say, "Oh, sweet!" And then give it to you like this. You deserve it all. There's a man who is truly repentant and broken. These are the sacrifices of the Lord. So, continuing on in verse 26.</p><p>The Lord, he answers with fire. He takes the burnt offering. So I, David, I built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And I called to the Lord and he answered me with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. The Lord commanded the angel and he put back his sword into his sheath.</p><p>And at that time, when I saw that the Lord had answered me on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, I offered sacrifice there. David worshipped. Yeah? David worshipped God. Wow! What an incredible story. This is crazy. You know? I would just... If I could talk to him, I would say, "This is...</p><p>This is crazy, you know?" You saw angel of destruction. And essentially, you saw near death of you and everybody you loved. But King David, like... It's strange, isn't it? Why? Why? Why was this not... I mean, clearly, it's not the notorious sin of David. Because in my eyes, it's like...</p><p>You just counted your men. I would have. I would have counted them. You know? And I checked in to see, like, how are the men doing? And made sure everybody was happy. And all of that. I would have... I would have been right there where you are. Do you know why God was so mad?</p><p>And then King David would say, "I do. I do know why he was so mad." Because as a young boy, God chose me. And then he raised me up to be his chosen king. And when he did, he gave me promises. This is what I remember. Turn your Bibles to 2 Samuel, chapter 7.</p><p>In 2 Samuel, chapter 7, starting from verse 12. This, you guys should know, as a pivotal passage in scripture, talking about the Davidic covenant. God's eternal promises to this line. And what his plans were for his kings. Take a look. Verse 12. He's talking to King David, and God says, "So when your days are complete, you'll lie down with your fathers.</p><p>But I will raise up your descendants after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name. For my name. So your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me. Forever. Your throne shall be established forever." The success of this kingdom is guaranteed.</p><p>King David actually doesn't even have to worry how many men he has. Doesn't matter. verse 18. So I, I went in and sat before the Lord, and I said, "Who am I? O Lord God, what is my house that you have brought me this far?" He gets it. He understands.</p><p>Verse 19. "And this was insignificant in your eyes, O Lord God, for you have spoken also of the house of your servant concerning the distant future. And this is the custom of man, O Lord." Again, what more can David say to you? "For you know your servant, O Lord God, for the sake of your word, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness to let your servant know.</p><p>For this reason you are great, O Lord God. For there is none like you. There is no God besides you. And according to all that we have heard with our ears, and what one nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for himself as a people, and to make a name for himself, to do a great thing for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people whom you have redeemed for yourself from Egypt, from nations and their gods." When I was younger, I knew and understood the kingdom is God's.</p><p>The throne is God's. Those mighty men I counted were God's. I was a fool to count them like they were my own. I messed with God's name. It's not mysterious. God is not flippant. He's not just this unstable force in the universe, and you do one thing wrong, and then he blows up everybody.</p><p>God told me what he was doing. God told me that the number of my men didn't matter. It's insignificant. Because God was doing a work for his own name. I offended his name. I don't have questions why God judged me. Oh my gosh. Right? If you're hearing this from David, it's just like, wow, what a point of conviction.</p><p>Now, in King David's defense, he did understand. Just like us, we have moments we get so deceived. And especially, if you're now in like a season of incredible success, scripture does tell you to be very careful. you will think this was the work of my own hand. If you're in the financial business, it is hard.</p><p>Be careful. I don't think God cares so much whether you're rich or you're poor. He cares if your eyes start to think I deserve credit for this. Yes? He knows your heart through and through. And he knows David's heart through and through. Praise God we have these accounts. But as interviewer, I would say David sometimes, I gotta be honest, I got mixed feelings about you brother.</p><p>King David like, you've got sins like every other king. You love beautiful women and you got weaknesses like every other man. But thank you for sharing how convicted you are. And I know that you understood. Take a look at verse 25 of 2 Samuel chapter 7. 2 Samuel chapter 7 verse 25 in David's defense.</p><p>Look at what he says. Now therefore, O Lord God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and his house, confirm it forever. And do as you have spoken. Why? Because he's like, Sweet! My throne! Yeah! No. That your name may be magnified forever. And by saying, The Lord of hosts is God over Israel.</p><p>And may the house of your servant David be established before you. He understood. Why? Because he specifically says, You God! Your name is magnified and glorified. And you God! You're the Lord of hosts. You guys know that God has many titles. El Shaddai, God Almighty, and all these things.</p><p>God the provider. God who sees. The Lord of hosts is also a unique name. What is he the host of? Is he the host? Like he's just ushering people into the kingdom, the eternal state? Just like a restaurant host where it's like, Come, come, welcome. No. He is the Lord of armies.</p><p>He is the commander. When you hear the Lord of hosts, When you hear the Lord of hosts, you're thinking banner of the military, the might of the military force. And he is the true commander. When David, then he knows immediately that when he went in, and he wanted a number, and he wanted a glory, and that number, whose place is he taking?</p><p>The Lord of hosts. So David understands. He knows what he did. So by way of conclusion, the question of like, why was this the most consequential sin? We get it. We get it. And as a concluding thought, like I mentioned before, God is very clear. He makes rich. He makes poor.</p><p>He makes mighty. He makes weak. He makes strong. He makes fragile. Even those we feel like are just simply, you know, how many times has God said, you have people who perhaps are disabled, lame, or sick. You understand even then, God is sovereign. So God then actually does not care whether the kingdom is huge or small.</p><p>In some sense, whether our church is big or small, God will glorify his name. Amen? He'll glorify his name through a huge church and he'll glorify his name through a small church. So what is it to us? King David, at the end of his life, he was transferring power to King Solomon.</p><p>And he was talking to the elders saying, you know, the people support Solomon. He's still going to be around and he's going to give his support to Solomon as well. In the midst of this, King David does something incredible, which is he starts leading praise. So if you turn your eyes over to 1 Chronicles chapter 29, 1 Chronicles chapter 29, starting in verse 10, this is what he says.</p><p>So David blessed the Lord in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, "Blessed are you, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever. Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty. Indeed, everything that is in the heavens and the earth, yours is the dominion, O Lord.</p><p>And you exalt yourself as head over all. Both riches and honor come from you. And you rule over all. And in your hand is power and might. And it lies in your hand to make great and to strengthen everyone. Now, therefore, God, we thank you and praise your glorious name." Let's pray.</p><p>God, thank you for this account. We do recognize, Lord, that we are susceptible. Mighty kings, your servants, anybody could be so susceptible to pride, losing sight of your greatness and wanting to count our own accomplishments. Give to us the kind of conviction David had. These are no excusable sins.</p><p>When our pride and our selfishness or ambition, our sense of our own worth and our own power rise, I pray, Father God, that you would help us to know your name is great alone and we must ourselves decrease. We thank you, Father, for this day, for giving us conviction.</p><p>We pray, Father God, that throughout our days, Lord, we would continue to see you as exalted. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.

Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the glory. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the glory.</p><p>Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness of the glory. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness.</p><p>Let us rise for the brightness. Let us rise for the brightness.

The Father will to crush Him as a sacrifice for sin. He'll satisfy God's justice, and a victory will rise again. Highly exalted, name above all names, worthy of all praise. You are waiting for me, Jesus, your King. All who are three kings. Salted to the highest place.</p><p>In the name above all other names. The tomb is empty, Christ is risen. Jesus, with our Lord's grace of love. The need is left to cease to worship. Jesus, have you glorified. To Him belongs the power. The wisdom, might and strength. All glory and dominion. To the Lord of every age.</p><p>In the name above all names. In the name above all names. In the name above all names. Name of all names, burning all the praise. Oh, what a reigning glory, Jesus, your King. Over everything, started to the highest place. Give in the name of the Lord, all the other names.</p><p>Our knees will bow, our top proclaim that you are Lord of all. Our knees will bow, our tops proclaim that you are Lord of all. You are Lord, you are Lord. Our knees will bow, our tops proclaim that you are Lord of all. You are Lord of all. Our knees will bow, our tops proclaim that you are Lord of all.</p><p>You are Lord of all. You are highly exalted. Name of all our sins. Worthy of all praise. Worthy of all praise. You are reigning in glory, Jesus, your King. For the way of King. Salted to the highest place. Salted to the highest place. Give in the name of our love.</p><p>Our love again. Amen. Amen. Let's pray together. Father God, we again thank you so much. Just like King David said, Lord, you are so great to let us know, to remind us that it is both appropriate and right, God, that you, the Lord of all, should be exalted and we be at your service.</p><p>Remind us, Father God, and help us to truly know that even if we get tempted to be boastful, to be self-reliant, God, give us this conviction that then we are at our absolute weakest. But God, even in this week, help us to trust you more. Help us, God, to rely on you.</p><p>For there are some who boast in chariots and some in horses, but we will boast in the name of the Lord, our God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
