href="https://www.vimeo.com/310685032#t=235s">00:03:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, so the listening portion of it, if the only intake of God's word is listening,</span></div><div

it's going to be very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/310685032#t=263s">00:04:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">vague to you.</span></div><div
