Again, I think you and I are tremendously blessed because we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=134s">00:02:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so many options and choices. I see so many people who have ability to travel now. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=141s">00:02:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">even just 30 years ago, not just in foreign countries, but even in the United States,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=146s">00:02:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to go out to the East Coast or go to Hawaii, it took major planning, major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=151s">00:02:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">commitment because traveling was not something that you just kind of did on a whim. Today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=155s">00:02:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean the flights are cheaper. In fact, our whole church is on the point system, so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=161s">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can use those points to go wherever you want. And even food, especially when you travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=167s">00:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to outside the country, you realize how spoiled we really are because we're used to eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=173s">00:02:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">different food almost every day. You eat Mexican food today, and tomorrow you can't have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=178s">00:02:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're sick of it already. You have sushi, so tomorrow I have to have steak. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=183s">00:03:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">had Korean food, so now tomorrow I have to have Indian food. So we have all these options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=188s">00:03:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And even when you travel to rich countries, they don't really have all the options that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=193s">00:03:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you and I have. So it's a blessing, even spiritually. If you don't like this sermon, you feel like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=200s">00:03:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"Ah, you know, Pastor Peter, he bombed today." You can go home, go on the internet, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=204s">00:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's thousands of other pastors who are preaching this morning that you can download</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=208s">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and listen to them. It's like, "Okay, now at least I got a good sermon this morning."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=211s">00:03:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have all kinds of options. You don't like the temperature of this building, you go somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=215s">00:03:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">else, you know. I mean, in one sense, it's a blessing, but if we're not careful, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=222s">00:03:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all these blessings that we have can easily bind us. And it easily binds us because, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=228s">00:03:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of so many options, we become less committed. We become onlookers and kind of picking and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=233s">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">choosing, like, just like if you had one thing to eat, there's nothing to think about, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=237s">00:03:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">know. I just need to eat, period. But with all the options, you're always thinking, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=242s">00:04:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"Should I eat this? Should I not eat that? I don't want to do this. I don't want to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=245s">00:04:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that." And you and I are living in a generation where commitment is difficult. Even when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=254s">00:04:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have every intention to attend this particular event. And again, this is not just our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=261s">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is just universal. People don't tend to commit to anything until the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=266s">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">minute, just in case. Who knows what's going to happen from now until three weeks from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=270s">00:04:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now. Maybe, maybe some, you know, musician's going to come into town that really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=275s">00:04:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">attend, and I don't want to commit to that. And as a result of that, we've created a generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=280s">00:04:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of onlookers, consumers. I want to weigh my options. And so this clear commitment, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=289s">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">clear conviction has become watered down. One of the things that I really love about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=296s">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scripture is scripture is absolutely crystal clear, especially in our generation where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=299s">00:04:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">everything's kind of wishy-washy. Everything's in the gray area. Where the Bible teaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=303s">00:05:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with conviction, He speaks with authority. And that's why when the people were hearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=308s">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus they were amazed. Not simply because of the miracles, but they were amazed that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=314s">00:05:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus was speaking with such clarity and conviction. And they said, "That man speaks with authority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=319s">00:05:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">unlike the scribes, unlike the Pharisees. When He speaks, He speaks with clarity that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=325s">00:05:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this is right and this is wrong. Here is light and here is darkness. Here's the children</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=329s">00:05:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, here's the children of the devil. Either you are living or you are dead. Either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=334s">00:05:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you love God or you hate Him." And He spoke with such clarity. Here's the line, "Do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=339s">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">stand with me or do you stand against me?" And again, because you and I are living in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=346s">00:05:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a generation where speaking with that kind of clarity almost always, automatically brings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=351s">00:05:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">some kind of scrutiny. Not only outside the church, but oftentimes even inside the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=356s">00:05:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">When we look at Paul's ministry, he hasn't even jumped into his content yet. In the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=361s">00:06:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter, the majority of it is just an introduction. All the way up to verse 17, he hasn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=367s">00:06:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">jumped into the meat of his letter yet. But he's introducing himself. So the first part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=373s">00:06:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sermon, the first part of the message when he said, "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=377s">00:06:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">called to be an apostle," he talked about his identity. His identity crystal clear, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=383s">00:06:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a slave of Jesus Christ.

He was an apostle set apart for the Gospel ministry. He knew exactly who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=394s">00:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he was. Not only did he know who he was, he knew exactly what the message was. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=399s">00:06:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about that last week. How this message, this Gospel was given from the prophets, from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=405s">00:06:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of old. This wasn't just something that Jesus just brought a new thing to a new generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=411s">00:06:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "This is at the core of who God is." God has been preparing from the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=417s">00:06:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the fall of man until the end of time, that this is at the core of his heart. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=421s">00:07:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when we talk about the Gospel, we're not talking about a good news. There's all kinds of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=429s">00:07:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">good news. We just believe that the good news is the best news. No, what Paul is saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=435s">00:07:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the news. This is the story. This is at the core of God. So Paul knew exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=444s">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what it was. This is at the core of God. He said, in fact, this Gospel is about Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=449s">00:07:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ and the whole purpose of this Gospel is to bring about obedience of faith. Today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=456s">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and for the next couple of weeks, we're going to be talking about Paul's ministry. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=459s">00:07:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be talking about his heart. We're going to be talking about what his intention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=464s">00:07:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is. Why does he want to come here? What is the goal of why he's writing this letter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=469s">00:07:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all contained in the next maybe about 10 verses. So we'll take maybe at least two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=473s">00:07:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks, maybe three weeks just unpacking this to see, again, have a greater glimpse of Paul,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=479s">00:07:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">his identity, his message and his ministry. So as we jump in this morning, there's one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=485s">00:08:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">clear thing that I want to emphasize this morning and hopefully at the end of the sermon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=488s">00:08:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that again, there's one point that I'm trying to make is that for Apostle Paul, his ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=496s">00:08:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was very, very personal. This was not just his job. You could see even by the way he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=504s">00:08:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">addresses God, he's not just talking to the God or a God or the most powerful God. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=512s">00:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">uses a very intimate word and he says, "My God." Look with me in verse eight. First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=518s">00:08:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. Now, when you read this, you can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=524s">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of read it and just pass by it. It's like, okay, you know, I think my God and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=527s">00:08:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a part of the introduction. But you see in Paul's letters that oftentimes when he talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=535s">00:08:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about God, he's a very personal God. I give thanks to my God always for you in 1 Corinthians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=540s">00:09:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">1.4.

Over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=558s">00:09:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">again, he's not referring to a God or the God, he's talking about my God. Now, why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=566s">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this important? And again, this is connected to everything else that he's going to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=571s">00:09:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If the God that we worship is not a personal God, he's just the God, he's just a holy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=579s">00:09:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">holy, holy God. And everything else that we do easily becomes drudgery, just easily becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=587s">00:09:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something that we have to do, it becomes a job. We do not present an impersonal God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=596s">00:09:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't give us a set of facts for us to regurgitate to other people. See, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=603s">00:10:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">good news until it is good news to you. If I said to you this morning, "Somebody won</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=611s">00:10:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the lottery," which is true, how does that affect you? It doesn't affect you at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=617s">00:10:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what? People win lottery every day. What if I told you that somebody in your local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=623s">00:10:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">neighborhood won the lottery? Oh, really? You know, and you're kind of curious, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=629s">00:10:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Who is that person? Maybe have a better effect, but maybe not personal. If I say somebody,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=636s">00:10:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody in this room won the lottery, then you're going to be all curious, "Who won the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=641s">00:10:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">lottery? Are they going to tide that? Are we moving now?" Right? It's going to affect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=649s">00:10:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you. What if I said somebody in your family won the lottery? Like, "How much are they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=653s">00:10:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to give me?" Right? If I said somebody, if I said you won the lottery, so you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=658s">00:10:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a different effect depending upon how personal it is. But if it's not, if it's not personal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=663s">00:11:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we say, "Somebody won the lottery." Right? "Somebody won the lottery." Okay. That's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=671s">00:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm happy for them.

The good news isn't good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=676s">00:11:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">news until it is personal. We don't spread the gospel of a bunch of information about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=683s">00:11:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">some theological truth that's true to the world until it is true to us. You know, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=691s">00:11:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know if those of you who've ever worked at telemarketing, but if you ever work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=694s">00:11:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">telemarketing, first thing that they train you to do is to have a little paragraph they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=700s">00:11:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want you to memorize. And they literally want you to say this word for word. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=704s">00:11:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they do this for two reasons. One, because they've tested out that these are things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=709s">00:11:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually has effect and they see that these are things that you need to say and these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=713s">00:11:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are the things that trigger people to make decisions. Another reason why they do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=717s">00:11:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for legal purposes, that you need to say certain words or certain phrases to legally be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=724s">00:12:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, "Oh, we're going to switch your phone company," or, "We're going to sell you this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=727s">00:12:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you exaggerate something, right? And legally, like they find out like, "Oh, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=732s">00:12:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">said something you shouldn't say." And then you turn that in, they'll reject that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=736s">00:12:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">legally they can't switch their company. So for those two reasons, you have to go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=742s">00:12:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">say these things perfectly. See, the gospel is not a set of facts that have been given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=747s">00:12:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to us where He says, "Here it is," and regurgitate this information to other people. If you examine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=755s">00:12:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, and it's not just Paul, but if you examine the authors of the books of the New Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=760s">00:12:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it was very personal. They weren't just telling, "You know, this is what I heard in my dreams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=766s">00:12:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and now I'm going to tell you." Right? They were personally deeply affected. He wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=773s">00:12:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just proclaiming some impersonal God, a set of information that's good news to the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=778s">00:12:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">world. He says, "My God, I thank my God whom I serve with my whole heart." That's why when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=787s">00:13:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus asked His disciples before we went to the cross, you know, we often ask the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=792s">00:13:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Why did He spend three years?" You know, in reality it was less than three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=797s">00:13:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but why did He commit three years to ministry? Couldn't He have just gone to the cross? Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=803s">00:13:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the primary reason why He spent three years with His disciples was to give them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=808s">00:13:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">conviction of who He was. So when He asked the question, "I know what the world says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=813s">00:13:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">who I am. Who do you say I am?" And that was the most important question. I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=819s">00:13:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was at the core of Jesus' discipleship. To bring them to a point, "I know what they say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=825s">00:13:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but we say, 'You're the Son of God. You are the Christ.'" And even as people were turning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=832s">00:13:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">away when Jesus said, "Are you going to turn from Me too?" And remember the disciples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=835s">00:13:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"Where are we going to go? You have the words of life." The question that we, again, repeatedly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=844s">00:14:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have to ask ourselves is not, "What does our church stand for?" You know, I hear people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=850s">00:14:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">say all the time, "Oh, you know, our church is involved with mission. Our church is involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=854s">00:14:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with this." And we just kind of vicariously think that we're living in obedience because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=858s">00:14:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our church, you know, our pastor, or our leaders. But who do you say He is? Who is He to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=867s">00:14:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Not to the church, but to you? See, with Apostle Paul, again, I've highlighted a few verses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=875s">00:14:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but one of the things that you'll recognize with Apostle Paul, it was extremely personal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=881s">00:14:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just in the way that he addressed God. If you keep reading, he says, "I thank my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=884s">00:14:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=888s">00:14:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son." So, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=894s">00:14:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">only is God a personal God, he says His serving is in His Spirit. What he means by that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=899s">00:14:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not saying, like, physically He's doing this, and spiritually there's something else going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=903s">00:15:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on. It's very, actually very common what he is saying. He's saying that my service to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=909s">00:15:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Him is not just external. I'm serving Him wholeheartedly. He is completely committed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=916s">00:15:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what he means. He's serving God externally and internally. See, it was extremely personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=924s">00:15:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to him. It wasn't just a job where he checked in and said, "Well, what do I do from 9 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=930s">00:15:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">5?"

Eleven chapters of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1586s">00:26:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">exposition of His grace and love.

So when Paul says, "In view of this mercy, in view of this tremendous gift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1633s">00:27:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have in Christ, let not just give our offering, not just give our animals, give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1637s">00:27:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual act of worship."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1647s">00:27:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is he saying?

So I remember sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1797s">00:29:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and thinking through that and I said, "Well, I better answer this correctly or else this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1801s">00:30:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">will be the end."

They weren't family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1920s">00:32:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">friends. They weren't no business contacts. He's never met these people. And that's why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1923s">00:32:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">he's writing this letter. And yet, he's writing this letter. He says, "I thank my God for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1928s">00:32:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world, I long to be with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1933s">00:32:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you." Now, is he just saying it because that's just what Christians say? You know how Christians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1939s">00:32:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Oh, I'm sick. I'll pray for you." And some of you pray, and some of you may not pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1947s">00:32:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's what we say. That's what we say. It's like, "Oh, hi. Bye. We'll pray for you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1953s">00:32:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what Paul is doing? Is this just something that a Christian says, right, and tells people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1960s">00:32:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And if not, if he actually means it, is he really rejoicing? Is he really longing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1968s">00:32:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">see them? I'm absolutely convinced that that's exactly what he's saying. In fact, he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1973s">00:32:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that over and over again to all the other churches. So, humanly speaking, we can look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1978s">00:32:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">at that. We have a hard time praying for people that we don't personally know. Now, when was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1983s">00:33:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the last time you really pleaded with God for lost souls that you've never met? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1989s">00:33:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">much easier when you've met them, right? Or you know them personally. So, we tend to pray</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1993s">00:33:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for ourselves, our family members, our good friends, our co-workers. These are people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=1997s">00:33:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">he's never met. The reason why Paul was so personally engaged was because he sacrificed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2004s">00:33:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. He sacrificed everything to bring the Gospel to them. So, he rejoiced when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2012s">00:33:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">saw the Gospel bearing fruit. That's what he says in 2 Timothy 2.10. I endure everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2017s">00:33:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">for the sake of the elect. And everything that Paul is talking about is beating. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2023s">00:33:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">confiscation of property. Risking his life, spending nights and months and years in jail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2030s">00:33:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He said he's risking all of that so that you may come to Christ. And that's why he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2035s">00:33:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in Philippians that some people are preaching Christ out of envy, but I rejoice. Whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2040s">00:34:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your motive is that Christ is being preached, that the Gospel is being spread. That's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2046s">00:34:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">personally involved he was with this message. And again in 1 Corinthians 9.22, I became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2052s">00:34:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all things to all people by all means that I may save some. When Rita came to Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2060s">00:34:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you know the people who rejoice the most are the people who talk to her, who prayed for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2064s">00:34:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">her, who are concerned for her, who share the Gospel with her. And I know the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2070s">00:34:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">people rejoice too, but the people who committed, people who sacrificed, people who are engaged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2077s">00:34:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">in this work. When we heard that Rita came to Christ, remember that day when she sent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2081s">00:34:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">an email and I read her email? And we, I'm literally, I mean it was momentary revival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2088s">00:34:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? We were just so elated that she came to Christ. And even those who didn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2094s">00:34:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">her personally, those who prayed with us in the church, you know, it felt like a family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2099s">00:34:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">member that came to Christ. See, Paul is spiritually, emotionally, socially engaged in this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2109s">00:35:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't a half-hearted commitment. He was willing to die to preach the Gospel. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2115s">00:35:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">why Apostle Paul, when he says, "I rejoice," that these aren't just words. This is a testimony</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2123s">00:35:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of an individual who's given everything to bring the Gospel to the lost. See, someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2129s">00:35:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">who is not engaged in the work, it's just news. If you haven't been engaged in praying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2136s">00:35:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for the lost, when you hear that somebody comes to Christ, it's just news. We talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2141s">00:35:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody, you know, like, "Oh, somebody became a Christian and they're going to give their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2144s">00:35:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">testimony." Right? If you're not personally engaged in that, it's like, "Oh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2149s">00:35:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">your mind tells you you should rejoice, because the Scripture says that.

You haven't given up anything important for the Gospel ministry. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2180s">00:36:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody comes to Christ, unless it is somebody in your family, somebody that you know personally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2185s">00:36:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't understand, like, "You rejoice over a bunch of these strangers." Paul was absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2192s">00:36:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">committed.

Because he invested so much in spreading the Gospel. He invested so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2224s">00:37:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in discipling them. He invested so much in praying for them, night and day. So he rejoiced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2229s">00:37:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">when they were doing well, just like your children.

He prayed for open doors. And then he said when the door gets open,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/139526437#t=2332s">00:38:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">he prayed that he would have boldness to preach.
