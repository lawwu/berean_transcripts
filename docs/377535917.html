class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=137s">00:02:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about it, all around the world, Christians are gathered on Sunday, like us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=143s">00:02:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to give worship to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span

but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=150s">00:02:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think just to give a kind of a general idea, the number of people who are gathering on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=155s">00:02:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sunday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=156s">00:02:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There are 800 to a billion Protestant Christians around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=161s">00:02:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If broken down by region, it would look like 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 260 million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=168s">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in Americas, 140 million in Asia Pacific, 100 million in

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=178s">00:02:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously gathering on Sunday is an important Christian tradition, but like any tradition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=185s">00:03:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it can be just that, a tradition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=187s">00:03:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We come to church because we have always come to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=190s">00:03:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was young, before I became a Christian, I told myself that once I grew up that I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=196s">00:03:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not attend church anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=199s">00:03:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason for that is because my father is pastor, as most of you know, and as a result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=208s">00:03:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I was attending church all the time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=210s">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Since I was born, even before I was born in my mother's womb, I was attending church service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=216s">00:03:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So church attendance for me was just something that I had to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=223s">00:03:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly in America, we went to a small church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=227s">00:03:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically it was our family and maybe an elder's family, so the youth group was very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=233s">00:03:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">small, not too much like the way we started here at Berean, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=238s">00:03:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I told myself that I wasn't going to go because I didn't see the purpose behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=242s">00:04:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't see the reason behind going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=245s">00:04:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't make sense to me because it meant nothing to me other than it was a tradition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=250s">00:04:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I did, something that I had to do on Sunday mornings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=255s">00:04:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the membership covenant, when it says I commit to attending Sunday worship, it means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=260s">00:04:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more than just being at church physically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/377535917#t=263s">00:04:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It means that we are committing to attendance, but also committing to understanding the reason</span></div><div
