one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=44s">00:00:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">learn how to study the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=49s">00:00:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the first thing that we want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=51s">00:00:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal of it is not for me to do the study and then to present to you what I found.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=55s">00:00:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is very different than what we do on Sunday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=59s">00:00:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really to kind of, my role here is to guide you through how to study the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=63s">00:01:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you don't study the Bible for yourself, you're not going to get as much out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=68s">00:01:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I would say the study is going to be very frustrating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=73s">00:01:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be frustrated for yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=74s">00:01:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be frustrated in the small group that you're with because you're expected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=81s">00:01:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to bring and contribute and not just to listen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=85s">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so no matter where you are in your stage of studying the Bible, we're trying to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=90s">00:01:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you to learn how to do the study for yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=93s">00:01:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we do that, again, one of the goals that we have is so that you may not be tossed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=101s">00:01:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">back and forth by every wind of doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=104s">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know that there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=108s">00:01:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of opinions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=109s">00:01:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people say different things about different texts and different theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=114s">00:01:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We want you to be able to have a good enough grasp of the Word of God for yourself that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=119s">00:01:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't ask, you know, five years, ten years, twenty years down the line, you know, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=124s">00:02:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">does our church think about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=127s">00:02:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you're a maturing Christian, one of the key components of being mature is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=133s">00:02:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a growing grasp of what the Word of God says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=137s">00:02:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you will be able to discern when bad doctrine, you hear bad doctrines, that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=141s">00:02:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">don't need us to tell you that it's bad, that the Word that you know will be able to guide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=147s">00:02:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you through that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=148s">00:02:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Thirdly, we want you to be able to make applications in your life based upon the proper understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=154s">00:02:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of the text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=155s">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, where Christianity is being practiced unbiblically is because they don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=162s">00:02:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=163s">00:02:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want the sanctification that you and I are striving for to come from a careful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=169s">00:02:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">study of the Word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=171s">00:02:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then fourthly, to be able to teach other people how to study the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=175s">00:02:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've been a Christian here at our church for two years, three years, five years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=180s">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're hoping that you'll be equipped enough to be able to teach other people also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=185s">00:03:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But not only that, as you and I know, we live in a biblical, illiterate, not only world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=191s">00:03:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but even the Christian world, where the Word of God is not highly valued in our generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=197s">00:03:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want you to be able to be a light within the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=201s">00:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We want you to be able to be the light where you can even guide other people in saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=206s">00:03:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, this is what the Word of God says."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=207s">00:03:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be able to point to Scripture instead of discussing the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=212s">00:03:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in the priority of how we study the Bible, first of all, again, this is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=216s">00:03:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I try to go through every time I teach the Bible, because I want our church to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=222s">00:03:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the priority of the exegesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=226s">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Exegesis basically is the verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book study through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=231s">00:03:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole Old Testament and the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=235s">00:03:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And to ask the question, to actually study the Word of God, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=238s">00:03:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just skim through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=240s">00:04:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's our priority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=241s">00:04:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what inductive Bible study basically is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=243s">00:04:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the exegesis of the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=246s">00:04:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has to be at the foundation of everything that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=251s">00:04:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse by verse study of the Word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=253s">00:04:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now if we have enough grasp of the different texts in the Bible, we have systematic theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=260s">00:04:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The systematic theology is a collection of our understanding of different parts of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=264s">00:04:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible and to be able to ask the question, not just what does this text say, but what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=269s">00:04:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">does the Bible say about this subject?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=271s">00:04:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So the best example of that would be the doctrine of Trinity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=276s">00:04:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The Trinity is not taught in one particular text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=280s">00:04:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a collection of things that Jesus said, things that are stated in the Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=284s">00:04:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are stated about God, things that Jesus says about God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=288s">00:04:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you collectively put that together, it teaches the doctrine of Trinity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=292s">00:04:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in a nutshell, that's what systematic theology is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=295s">00:04:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the Bible teach about the end time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=298s">00:04:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the Bible teach about Israel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=299s">00:04:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the Bible teach about itself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=302s">00:05:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's systematic theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=304s">00:05:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can't have systematic theology until you have enough exegesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=309s">00:05:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you have systematic theology and growing, you're able to compare with historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=316s">00:05:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=317s">00:05:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Historical theology basically is what did our church fathers, what did the historical</span></div><div

it helps to make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=410s">00:06:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of times sermons will help us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=413s">00:06:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I give sermons, I try to take what the Bible teaches

us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=422s">00:07:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where philosophical theology is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=423s">00:07:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we are not careful, we can make philosophical theology our priority, where we have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=429s">00:07:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of discussions about what makes sense and doesn't

on, saying like, "I think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=438s">00:07:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">right.</span></div><div

and this is what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=470s">00:07:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that we need to do in inductive Bible study is to have a larger grasp of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=476s">00:07:56.220</a></span> | <span

to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=501s">00:08:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out what the story is about.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=510s">00:08:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, I mean, you know what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=513s">00:08:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to have a good grasp of the totality of what this letter is about.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=535s">00:08:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for most of us, you need to read it at least three or four times and you kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=539s">00:08:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of get an idea on the flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span

outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=550s">00:09:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So read about two or three times and then possibly on the

write it over here, would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=563s">00:09:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">be obviously the introduction of Paul's

12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/451684618#t=603s">00:10:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So just a large outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span
