Why don't we rise together, and then I'm gonna go ahead and pray for us, and then we're gonna sing a few songs together. Let's pray. God, you are great and worthy of honor. Lord, we come before you with a desire to see your name magnified.</p><p>I pray, Lord God, that you ready our hearts, that you give us humbleness of heart as we approach a God who is holy, holy, holy. And yet, Lord God, you are gracious and merciful to us, that you restore the relationship with you. Through the blood of Christ, that we are able to come and approach your throne with confidence.</p><p>Father, I pray, Lord, that as the church is gathered to pray and to sing these songs of worship, may it be a sweet sound unto your ear. May your prayers be effective. Help us, Lord God, to put away any distractions in our minds and our schedules, Lord God, and really focus our attention to what we're doing here tonight.</p><p>We ask, Lord God, that you give us brokenness and repentance, Lord God, that our hearts may be inclined towards you. So we ask, Lord God, for your spirit to remind us of many things that we're doing in our lives, Lord God, that need to be pruned. And, Lord God, that you give us the strength to be sanctified, to be living in a way, Lord God, that is pleasing for you.</p><p>So we ask and entrust this time to you. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. >> If you can turn your Bibles. Can you turn the light on just a little bit? So I can see? Okay, that's good. All right. Verses 35 through 38. It says, Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.</p><p>Seeing the people, he felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. Let's pray. Father, we pray that you would give us understanding.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, to be convicted that your word would prepare us to spend time in prayer together. That we may seek you, that our prayers, Lord God, would be sincere in the overflow of your spirit's guiding. Lord, as you reminded us and encouraged us, that your Holy Spirit groans within us with words that we cannot understand, that may intercede on our behalf, Lord God, for the very things that you desire.</p><p>So help us this evening to know your word, and that your word would ignite in us a passion for you and for the lost. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Tonight, I wanted to take some time to pray for the lost in our lives, for our generation, for the spreading of the gospel.</p><p>You know, every time I am outside of our church, you see the harvest, and everywhere I go, people are literally begging for help. Whether it is in another country or in other churches, and they're desperate, there are tremendous need, and they want help, whether that is financial, whether that is just more young people to come alongside and help with their work.</p><p>And sometimes as our church grows, we can become insulated because there's so much need and things that we need inside the church, that after a while, we no longer have a spirit of evangelism. And you say, "Well, why are we evangelizing, and be so worried about what's going on outside the church, when there's so much going on inside the church?" But, so much of the problems that are created inside the church is because we're not paying attention to what's going on outside the church.</p><p>So much of fellowship, lack of prayer, lack of urgency, the importance of the word of God, all of these things are directly connected to God's great commission. So when we're not directly connected to the great commission, and I'm not just talking about the leadership, I'm talking about the church, when you're not directly connected to the great commission, there's no urgency in prayer.</p><p>Word of God is just studying, adding knowledge. Fellowship just becomes stimulation, just having somebody to talk to about God, or finding encouragement with one another. Everything that we do in the church is directly linked to the calling that God has given us in the church. The text that we're looking at tells us that almost everything that Jesus did, he did because of compassion.</p><p>He saw the multitude, and he said he was moved with compassion. The word "compassion" literally means to have your bowels move. You know, in our culture, when we say "bowel move," I mean, we mean something different, right? But basically, it's the heart of emotion. That's what, you know, at that period of time, what the Greeks and the Jews meant when they said that their bowels, their inner core of who they are, was moved.</p><p>It wasn't just a light feeling. There's a compelling that happened, a yearning. Everything that we see in Matthew 20, 33, 34, we see that what moved Jesus was his compassion. They said to him, "Lord, we want our eyes to be open." He said, "Moved with compassion." Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately, they regained their sight and followed him.</p><p>Matthew 1, 40, 41, "A leper came to Jesus, "beseeching him and falling on his knees before him and saying, "'If you are willing, you can make me clean.' "Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand "and touched him and said to him, 'I am willing to be cleansed.'" Luke 10, 33, 34, "But a Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him, "and when he saw him, he felt compassion." This is Jesus saying this is the reason behind why the Samaritan decided to get involved.</p><p>"And came to him and bandaged up his wounds, "pouring oil and wine on them, and he put him on his beast "and brought him to an inn and took care of him." Luke 15, verse 20, the parable of the prodigal son. It says, "So he got up and came to his father, "but while he was still a long way off, "his father saw him and felt compassion for him "and ran and embraced him and kissed him." Typically, we don't move.</p><p>I can give you knowledge and I can convince you what is truth and what is right, but typically, most people don't lead into action until you are moved with compassion, right? It's much easier to raise money for orphans because we can show you pictures of orphans and how they are desperate and they are in need, and it's not hard to move people toward compassion.</p><p>And so because we look at them helpless and because they are in need of someone to help them, it's not that hard. Even non-Christians will donate for the cause of orphans. The Bible tells us that everything God did, he did with compassion. He looked at us, and instead of being disgusted by our sins, he felt compassion for us.</p><p>In fact, that's the main reason. Like if you study the book of Hosea, it's an indictment against a nation of Israel. "You are not my people," right? Like, "I will not hear you." And yet, in Hosea 11:8, after he gives all this indictment against a nation of Israel, he says, "How can I give you up, O Ephraim?</p><p>"How can I surrender you, O Israel? "How can I make you like Adonai? "How can I treat you like Zeboam? "My heart is turned over within me. "All my compassion are kindled." See, the reason why Israel was never destroyed, even though God warned them and God punished them, it says his compassion was kindled.</p><p>Compassion is what caused God to send his only begotten son. Compassion was the reason why Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb. Compassion was the reason why Jesus wept while he was riding into Jerusalem. Compassion is what moves us to be patient when somebody wrongs us. If we have hatred toward them, it's very difficult to move with compassion or to show grace.</p><p>Patience and grace usually is followed because we look at them, and even if they wronged us, we have compassion on them. So compassion overwhelms us, and compassion moves us to obey and to practice what God practiced with us. But why do we oftentimes have it very difficult for us to understand?</p><p>We know it mentally, but emotionally, why is it hard for us to relate to that? Let me read you a passage in Matthew 13, 49-50. "So it will be at the close of the age the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace.</p><p>In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." If I asked you in this room how many of you believe in heaven and hell, I think most of you will at least raise your hand, doctrine only, because you believe that this Bible is God's Word, and you know that that's a doctrine that's been passed down to us from the first century.</p><p>That we believe, if you believe in heaven, if you believe in God, if you believe in the gospel, as much as there is reward, there is judgment coming. And he says, "It will be a fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, and there is no end to this." Why does that not move us to compassion?</p><p>Why do we read that passage like a stale doctrinal statement? If you see somebody hurt, if I told you that a dog got ran over, a cute little dog got ran over outside, you say, "Oh my gosh." If we see other things, tragedies, earthquakes, you move with compassion, yet the greatest tragedy that you and I could possibly imagine, that we are surrounded by people, if they do not repent before they die, the Bible says that they will meet a holy, holy, holy God, and judgment is waiting upon them, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth with no end.</p><p>And yet, we live day to day proclaiming that we believe that and professing that we believe that, checking off the mark as a doctrinal statement, yet it doesn't move us to evangelize. When was the last time you prayed for the lost, weeping for them? Why has our heart hardened, or why has it become normal to profess this with no movement?</p><p>I remember meeting an oncologist who told me that regularly his job is to tell people that they have two months to live, one month to live, three months to live. And I remember asking him, "How do you handle that?" And he said, "Eventually, we become numb." He said, "There have been situations where one of their colleagues would tell somebody that your father only has a day or two days to live.</p><p>I mean, he's at the end, and you guys need to prepare." And then as soon as he exits the room, they're telling jokes to one another. And he says that they become so callous, that he said, "It no longer thinks that." It's shocking to hear that, and I know how shocking that may sound to you, but he said that that's the only way that they're able to do their job, if they somehow cut it off.</p><p>There are police officers who become so numb to violence, they can see somebody jumping off of a building or shot or head decapitated from an accident and joke about it. And it's shocking to the rest of us, but they see it so often, they harden their hearts, and it doesn't bother them until you take a step back, and somebody who's not in that situation looks at them and says, "How could you be so callous?" The scholars believe they have a name for that.</p><p>They call it hedonic adaptation. It says mental habit done over and over, when it is stimulated over the same thing, eventually becomes mundane. And once it becomes mundane, we become insensitive to hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting what is around us. We become so accustomed to talking about judgment, and we've heard it so many times, that that statement no longer shocks us, no longer moves us.</p><p>It's just part of our doctrinal statement. We want to talk about good things of God, and the Bible is yet filled with warnings of if they do not repent. And the whole reason why Christ has not come yet is because he is patiently waiting for the church to bring the gospel to this lost world.</p><p>The problem is not that we don't have money. The problem is not that we're lacking training. The problem is not that there's lack of schools. The problem is we don't have the will. And we don't have the will because we are not moved. Sometimes this is called hedonic treadmill.</p><p>Like if you go to the gym and you exercise, and anybody who's lifted weights, you know that if you lift weights in the same way over and over again, after a few weeks, a few months, it no longer has the effect because your muscles have adapted to that. And so you need to do something else to shock the muscle.</p><p>You're no longer growing because your muscles have adapted. Our spiritual muscles have adapted to this shocking truth that maybe at one point in our lives, it moved us. Maybe at one point in our lives, there was a desperateness and sense of urgency when we prayed, and we need to evangelize.</p><p>We need to tell people about this truth. But for whatever the reason, we have become accustomed, accustomed to hearing that the whole world, it will be judged under his fiery judgment. And we are more concerned about what we're going to be doing in our holidays. We're more concerned about if I'm going to be able to make the right investments, if I'm going to marry the right person, if I'm going to buy the right house.</p><p>None of these things are sinful in and of itself. But when that becomes the primary thing that we're concerned about, imagine from God's perspective. He's waiting for the church to wake up to plead according to his will, according to his word, and then to hear over and over and over and over again the same prayer, "Keep me healthy.</p><p>Keep me safe. Make sure that I'm making the right decision. Make sure that things that I want and I desire that I can have." Imagine from God's perspective, he sent his only begotten son, and he said, "Go, make disciples of all the nations." And instead of going, we said, "Well, not everybody needs to go.</p><p>Not everybody. God didn't call everybody to evangelize. That's not my gift." Lukewarm basically means to adapt to the temperature of the room. That's what lukewarm is. And so the harshest rebuke goes to the Laodicean church because of their lukewarmness. They're neither hot nor cold. Now, lukewarmness doesn't happen because you choose one or the other.</p><p>Lukewarmness basically is adapting to the culture that you belong to, adapting to the entertainment, adapting to its values, adapting to the music, adapting to the movies that you watch. And you become more and more like the culture and the generation that we live in, and you become lukewarm. So the things that make them sad makes us sad.</p><p>Things that make them happy makes us happy. That's what lukewarmness is. We've just become just like the culture around us. Matthew 24:12 says, "Because of lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold." Why would lawlessness cause many people's love to grow cold? Because they're adjusting. The increase of wickedness is no longer shocking.</p><p>It no longer compels us. And so we adapt. It's just the way it is. We need to take a step back and ask ourselves, why does this truth not compel us? Why do we look at the loss and not feel any compassion? Why am I able to live my life like anybody else in this world, coming to church week after week after week after week, professing that we believe this and yet entangled with civilian affairs?</p><p>When was the last time you pleaded on God's behalf for the lost? When was the last time that you made an effort to share the gospel with somebody that did not know? Not just applauding what other people are doing. Not just reading books and being encouraged by what other people are doing.</p><p>When was the last time that you were moved with compassion? The text that we're looking at, I want to highlight three things from this text because, one, compassion comes from engagement with the lost. It tells us that Jesus went from city to city. He didn't just come and sit on the throne and then give a sermon and then say, "Everybody come if you want to listen to me." Jesus went after them.</p><p>He left his throne and he went from city to city. He went from city to city. And those of you who've been to India with us, you know the distance that from driving we need to go an hour and a half to two hours in a car to get to these villages.</p><p>Pastor Matthew, who started this ministry, would walk into these villages. It would take days to get in. And if they reject him, they would have to walk out. The Bible tells us that Jesus and his disciples went city to city looking, seeking, so that they may find a synagogue, preach about the kingdom, healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.</p><p>Now, he didn't heal them because somehow that was going to change their life drastically. He knew that they were going to die in their sins if they do not repent, but he served them because he was compassionate. He didn't say, "Well, you're going to die anyway." No, when he saw that they had need, he served them.</p><p>Compassion doesn't come from a distance. If you live in a bubble where all you're concerned about is your friends and then you go back to your home, you enjoy the safety and your nicely air-conditioned situation, and your whole life is circled around the comfort of your home, you may feel compassion here and there, but you will not be moved with compassion.</p><p>It's hard to love people from a distance. It's easy to judge people from a distance, but it's very difficult to love people from a distance because you don't know their heartache, you don't know their pain, you don't know their struggles, you don't know their needs. We have a tendency to create an environment where we feel safe and comfortable, and anybody who makes us feel uncomfortable, who don't talk like us, who don't have our values, we tend to keep them out of our homes.</p><p>Jesus went from city to city to seek and save the lost. Compassion comes when you recognize their needs. You're not going to recognize that from a distance. It tells us that Jesus saw them, and he had compassion because they were distressed. Distressed basically means exhausted. They were about to faint.</p><p>They were dispirited. It literally means to be cast down or defeated. And they were like sheep without shepherds, directionless, helpless. Sheep without a shepherd means that they're vulnerable to attacks, that wolves can come and any danger can come, and they're completely vulnerable. Jesus had compassion. He was compelled because when he saw them, he saw sinners who were exhausted, living in this sinful world, where death reigns.</p><p>When's the last time you talked to a nonbeliever and you saw that? Yes, I know, we get exhausted. We get tired. Difficult situations come into our life, but we have hope in Christ. Even in your worst nightmare, you will be in heaven earlier. We're not talking about just being fatigued and tired.</p><p>We're talking about people who have no hope. Jesus saw them, and because they were in their sins, they were exhausted. They were working with no end. When they get into trials, there is no hope. There's nowhere to turn to. They were defeated. Do you remember before you met Christ, some of you, what it was like when you had no hope?</p><p>I do. I remember being bitter and angry, thinking that this life is not worth living because I had no exit. I couldn't see in front of me. I didn't want to live, but I can't end it. How many people do you think that are living around us who have no hope, and they go through trials, and they're defeated and beaten, and they are completely unprotected?</p><p>They are sheep without shepherd. See, that's not something we can know from a distance. You can hear what I'm saying and hear it as a theory. But most likely, you probably know somebody in your life, most likely, whether it's a close family member or maybe your neighbor, maybe a co-worker, maybe somebody that you knew.</p><p>You probably know somebody who doesn't know Christ. I want to take some time to pray for them. And then compassion is ultimately what brings us to God. Before we organize and we get to do this, when we are moved with compassion, we feel helpless. That the only answer is not, "Let's get organized.</p><p>Let's get courageous. Let's do something." Because what they are in need of, you and I do not have the answer in and of ourselves. The only answer to their fatigue, them being defeated, and them being helpless without direction is the gospel of Jesus Christ. So when you are moved to compassion, it forces you to pray with urgency.</p><p>You may not be sick. There may not be any emergency in you. But there will never be a time in your life while we are living here where we have no cause of urgency because we are surrounded by people who do not know Christ. Every single day that we live, we are living with people in our generation, all around us, and many even in our own homes who do not know Christ.</p><p>So there is never a minute, as long as we live on this earth, where there is no sense of urgency. If there is no sense of urgency, something has gone wrong with us. He says to his disciples, "Harvest is plentiful." And as I told you, one of the common questions I get now, as I'm getting a little bit older, more and more of my peers are beginning to either plan for retirement or thinking of retirement.</p><p>And one of the most common questions that I get is, "What are you planning? Are you going to retire when you're 60? Are you going to retire when you're 70? What are you planning?" I have no idea. But every time I go outside, I am compelled that the benefit of having a large church is that we have resources that we haven't had before.</p><p>We have resources of people that we haven't had before. We can mobilize that we couldn't do before. And so what that means is we are more responsible today than we were five years ago. God has given more to steward today than 10 years ago, which means there's more work to engage in today than 10 years ago.</p><p>The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. The harvest is plentiful. People are dying every single day. But when it says the workers are few, it means few are seeking the lost. Few are crying out for the lost. Few care for the lost. Few are committed in their lives to bring the gospel to the lost.</p><p>So therefore, he says to beseech the Lord of the harvest. This isn't just let him know. He already knows. It's not just ask. He already knows. He's waiting for us. He's waiting for us to be desperate. He's waiting for us to make up our mind. He's waiting for us to be moved with compassion.</p><p>He's waiting for us to weep for the lost as Christ wept for us. So when he says beseech the Lord of the harvest, he's not saying that because our God is indifferent to move him. That we need to shake him. That we need to somehow cause him to have compassion.</p><p>He's waiting for us to make up our mind. What is it that you are entangled with that is more important than to bring the gospel to the lost? Nothing. Nothing. When we get to heaven, we're not going to regret the places that we haven't seen, the food that we haven't eaten.</p><p>We're not going to regret any of that. If there is regret, and I'm not sure, but if there is regret, every single Christian will regret that we didn't spend every single minute of our life to bring the gospel to as many people as possible. I wanted to take some time to pray and beseech the Lord together.</p><p>People ask me, how are you guys running a church with four pastors and four elders? And I could say, yeah, we have many people serving, which we do. A lot of people who are engaged in our church, which we do. But so much of the problem in the church is created because we are not engaged in the Great Commission.</p><p>You complaining about other people not reaching out to you? Think how selfish that looks like from God's perspective. I gave you my son. You have hope in eternity. And you're going to live every day complaining about what you don't have when you are surrounded by people who are dying without Christ?</p><p>And instead of crying for them, you're crying because you don't have the right house? Imagine what that sounds like, grumbling, who have Christ from God's ears. He's waiting for us. He's waiting for us to make up our mind. He's waiting for us. We're going to pray. One, if you can put up the prayer request.</p><p>And then I'm going to ask the praise team to come up and we're going to sing as a prayer. OK, if I can ask the praise team to come up and after I give the prayer topics. I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray, but I'm going to ask you not to pray simply casually.</p><p>I don't know what intense prayer looks like to you. But to pray intensely. Something has gone wrong with our hearts. Something has seriously gone wrong with our hearts. Our perspective, our entanglement, our view of the church, our Jewish fellowship, our view of safety, our view of God's blessing, all of it, something has gone wrong.</p><p>To come before the Lord and beseech the Lord of the harvest. Pray for those who are nearest to you who are not Christians. Some of you may have given up because you've been so frustrated that you've been praying for them and they didn't come to Christ and maybe you're even doubting if God's going to listen.</p><p>You need to reawaken that hope in Christ. To pray. Pray with urgency. I pray that some of you will be in tears praying for them. Because they don't know how to pray. Only your prayers intercedes for them. So pray for them desperately. Pray for those who you have vocational contact with.</p><p>You know who they are. You don't interact with them much. But they are desperate. Pray for them. Don't just feel bad for them. Pray for them. Pray for the loss in the lives of our congregation. Not just for yourselves, but pray for there's many people in our church who are praying for their loved ones.</p><p>Pray for them. Pray for the loss in our generation. In India, in Korea, in Taiwan, in Japan, and in the U.S. In Irvine, in your schools. Pray for them. Intercede. Beseech the Lord of the harvest. That God would use you. That God would use our church. To bring the gospel to them.</p><p>Pray that God would send out more workers. Pray that you would become that worker. Pray that God would give you the courage to open your mouth wherever you are. You don't need to go street preaching. You don't need to be awkward. Pray, Lord, help me to be bold and open my mouth so that I can make the gospel clear to them.</p><p>Pray, finally, that God would break your heart. If you've never prayed with compassion for the lost, then you do not know the heart of God yet. If you've never prayed with sorrow in your heart for those who do not know Christ, you do not fully understand. You may know, you may be able to repeat the mind of Christ, but you do not know the heart of Christ.</p><p>When he says, if you abide in me, my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you. You know what's at the heart of that prayer? The heart of abiding in Christ and his word abiding in us is us joining him for his work.</p><p>So pray that you would know the heart of God. Pray that you would be broken for the lost and that we would dedicate our lives. In wherever you are, in whatever that you are doing, that we would dedicate our lives, whether you are a stay-at-home mom, whether you are working, whether you are a student, that wherever you are, that God would use you to be the light.</p><p>So we're going to sing this song together, and then we're going to give you time. We're going to give you a chunk of time, about 30 minutes, just to pray on your own, okay? And pray fervently for this. And I'm going to ask you, if you pray better when you're away from other people, you pray better when you're on the ground, we're going to move these chairs and we're going to have you sit.</p><p>Otherwise, you can sit where you're at and just take some time. And if you're wrestling with prayer, don't give up. Our natural tendency is as soon as our mind begins to wander somewhere, we think, "Oh, I'm having a hard time," and you quit. Don't quit. Just like Jesus told his disciples, "Couldn't you stay awake for one hour?" It's because they didn't understand what was coming.</p><p>The reason why our mind wanders is because we don't understand the seriousness of what God has called us to. So if you see yourself wandering, pray, persevere and pray. Go take a break if you need to. Come back, drink a cup of water, but wrestle in prayer. Don't just give up.</p><p>So let's sing this song together, and then I'm going to lead you and ask you to take some time to pray on your own. Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry. Blow my heart so that you may dry. Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.</p><p>Cause me to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer. Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry. Blow my heart so that you may dry. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. Cause us to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer.</p><p>Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry. Blow my heart so that you may dry. Cause me to stand and cry out for this land. Cause me to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer. Make us a prayer, let our prayers be a cry.</p><p>Blow our hearts so that you may dry. Cause us to stand and cry out for this land. Cause us to be a people who's set free to stand as a house of prayer. Cause us to stand as a house of prayer. Let's take some time to pray and in about 25 minutes I'll knock on the podium to get us back together.</p><p>So let's take some time to pray on our own. If I can ask now if I can get together with about three people around you and then designate what to pray for. And so if you have specific things that you're praying for, certain people, to take some time to pray.</p><p>Now you've prayed for them, now ask them to pray for you. And then pray again, pray for all, just divvy up the things and take some time to pray. And then after about 10, 15 minutes, our prayer team is going to come up and I'm going to pray for us and then we'll wrap up our evening.</p><p>Okay? So if you want to continue to pray on your own, you're more than welcome to do that. Otherwise, turn around and try to grab about three people around you. Try not to make it more than three because you're not going to be able to hear each other. So just get together and if you want to move around, you can move around.</p><p>So let's do that for the next about 10 minutes and then I'll call us back when we're about to finish. I can ask the praise team to slowly start coming back up. If you are finished with your prayer, if you can stand up with us. If not, you can continue to pray.</p><p>Let's pray. Lord, I pray that as you've heard our prayers, Lord, would you open a door for the gospel to be heard, Lord God, for those people who are around us, the people that we love. Lord, if we have given up hope because it's been so long, I pray that you would rekindle in our hearts, Lord God, a desperateness to intercede on their behalf.</p><p>Help us to open our eyes to see the lost that we are working with, that we are studying with, that we are surrounded by. Lord, they are like sheep without shepherd. Lord, they are dispirited. Lord, they are lost, Lord God, because they do not know you. I pray that as you have given us hope, help us, Lord God, to be a conduit of hope in this lost world.</p><p>Lord, I pray that the greatest joy that we would experience in this life would be to see the lost come to Christ. Fixate our eyes, Lord God, upon the things that you are fixated on, that we may follow the footsteps, Lord, of the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us.</p><p>So many saints, so many missionaries, so many church members, Lord God, who have gone before us, that brought the gospel to us. Help us, Lord God, to take that baton, that in our generation, but for our inheritance, that you would give us the lost. Open our eyes, soften our hearts, Lord God.</p><p>Give us compassion for them. Help us to intercede for them. Help us, Lord God, to cry out on their behalf. That we may see many, many more people come to Christ through our church, through our efforts, through our fellowship, through our giving, through our sacrifices, through our study. May it all, Lord God, bring glory to your name.</p><p>Help us, Lord God, if we have been entangled with things that don't matter. Help us, Lord, to number our days. That we may see them, Lord God, in the light of eternity. That we may give all that we have for the sake of what you've done for us. Bring revival.</p><p>Revive our church. Revive our families. Revive the fathers, revive the mothers. Revive the young. Revive our college students. Revive our singles. Revive our young families. Revive the old. Revive us, Lord God. That our worship may be in spirit and in truth. Send us. Send us. That you would raise up people who are willing to go for the sake of your name.</p><p>In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
