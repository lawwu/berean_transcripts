second portion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=728s">00:12:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of that, because Christ comes and he fulfills the

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=777s">00:12:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But specific application of the end times that we're talking about is the very end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=781s">00:13:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about the tribulation during the time of millennium, the right throne judgment at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=785s">00:13:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the very end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=788s">00:13:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So we believe that, again, the way that we're interpreting this is that there's a future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=792s">00:13:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">event that's going to take place with the tribulation and

not completely futurist, but that's probably the closest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=804s">00:13:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that will, you know, the things that at least I've been talking about related to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=808s">00:13:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=810s">00:13:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have the idealist approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=814s">00:13:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Idealist approach basically is none of this is meant to

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=820s">00:13:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're supposed to allegorize everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=831s">00:13:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're always looking for hidden meaning, right?</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=837s">00:13:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why it's important for you to know this is because if you study the book of

we studied this, but then this commentary says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/227523995#t=853s">00:14:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this," it's because
