swim,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=149s">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so they would jump in the water and go back and forth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and Jeremy didn't know how to swim at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=154s">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, right around that time, you know, this one particular day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=158s">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I forget which day it was, but this one particular day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=161s">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my father had a heart attack a week before, so he was in the hospital for a period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=166s">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we actually picked him up, and on the way back home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=169s">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we stopped at our house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=171s">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my dad was resting in our backyard, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=174s">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like just resting before we sent him back home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=177s">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were all inside, and all of a sudden, we hear this splash in the swimming pool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=182s">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so we run out to see our dad, you know, we're all kind of freaking out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=186s">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because he just had a heart attack, and we see our dad in the pool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=189s">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, fetching Jeremy out of the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=192s">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically what happened was, you know, his cousins were swimming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=195s">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they went inside, and Jeremy wanted to imitate them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=198s">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so he got on the slide, and he slid into the pool, and he was face down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=202s">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the only adult that was outside was my dad, so he just jumped into the pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=206s">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you know, he just had a heart attack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was in the hospital for five days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=211s">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was soaking wet, and he came out, and I remember when my dad pulled him out of the water,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=215s">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were expecting Jeremy to be like, you know, choking and crying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=219s">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and pulled him out of the water, and he just walked out, and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=222s">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Thanks, Grandpa," and then he just walked in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=226s">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously, we were watching that, and we were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=229s">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"That kid has no idea just what happened."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=232s">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this grandfather, I mean, after five days of being in the hospital,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=237s">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he ran in, he sprained his legs, you know, sprained his ankle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fetching him out of the water, basically saved his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=244s">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, but he's just like, "Oh, thanks, Grandpa," and then he just walked in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=247s">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tiled off, and went out and played with his cousins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=250s">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you know why I share this story, because sometimes we receive salvation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a flippant way, and we just kind of, "Thanks, God, thanks for saving me,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=260s">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, "We praise you," and then we go home like nothing happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=264s">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=268s">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what it is that we have been saved from, our response would be just as flippant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=271s">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Thanks, God," and you say, "Oh, we talk about His grace,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=274s">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about salvation and going to Heaven, but it doesn't make any effect on us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because we don't recognize exactly what it is that we have been saved from."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=284s">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you know, when my children are younger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, one of the things that I used to do to discipline them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141612728#t=292s">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that if they did something, I would ask them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
