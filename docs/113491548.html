href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=105s">00:01:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that I was mostly impressed with is how they're working through the local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=108s">00:01:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">church and how the money is not only being used to get children out of poverty, but how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=113s">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're working through the local church and how many of these children and their parents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=118s">00:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and their siblings end up coming to

different parts of the Philippines and different churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=126s">00:02:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and see the gospel ministry really, even though it's presented as, you know, getting children</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=133s">00:02:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">out of poverty, the bigger work really is the gospel ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=137s">00:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was able to see that and I was really encouraged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=140s">00:02:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, we asked him that when he's going to come here in February because his wife</span></div><div

think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=151s">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so she's going to prepare, deliver and then recover all of that while here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=155s">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because Peter, Peter Chang, he's actually travels quite a bit, so he won't be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=160s">00:02:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be with her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=161s">00:02:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'd be a good idea for him to, for them to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=164s">00:02:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But he's going to come in February and I asked him, again, I have to talk to the elders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=168s">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but again, so he'll give a little bit more presentation of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=172s">00:02:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it's something that we can pray about getting involved with, about maybe supporting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=176s">00:02:56.580</a></span> | <span

Philippines obviously was a tremendous blessing for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=183s">00:03:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I knew that I was going to be able to see a lot of things and they deliberately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=187s">00:03:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">took us to what they call extreme poverty, not just poverty, but extreme poverty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=192s">00:03:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were taken to different homes in different places in parts of Philippines where they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=198s">00:03:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling and none of that really surprised me because I went there expecting that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=203s">00:03:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've been to different parts of the world where I've seen poverty, I've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=208s">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">extreme poverty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so none of that stuff really was shocking to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=212s">00:03:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was shocking, what I didn't expect is to run into so many of the sex trafficking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=218s">00:03:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span

hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=224s">00:03:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">because we were in areas, visiting areas where there was a lot of poverty and a lot of churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=228s">00:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reaching out to the

Westerners coming in and it didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=235s">00:03:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hit any of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=236s">00:03:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was there with about 10 other pastors and it didn't hit any of us until about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=240s">00:04:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">second or third day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=242s">00:04:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we started noticing a lot of old men, 50s, 60s, maybe even 70 year old men with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=247s">00:04:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">young teenage girls.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=299s">00:04:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, all of this stuff is happening because of poverty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/113491548#t=303s">00:05:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're not there doing this forcefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
