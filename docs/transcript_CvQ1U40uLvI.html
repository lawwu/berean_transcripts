We're going to get started with our praise and prayer for the month of July. And before we begin, and as people are still coming in, I want us to just kind of reflect on this question. What are we doing here tonight? Is it like a prerequisite hour and a half that you have to give to the Lord before you guys can go across the way and play games? Because I know there is time for fellowship this evening. Or are you here because you have had a rough week, things have happened, and you want to draw near to the Lord? Or are you here just because this is something we do with our church? And what I want us to do before we actually get into our time of just praise and prayer is to reflect on that question. What am I doing here? Who am I praying to? Who am I approaching? And so I want to give you about 30 seconds just to ask God to prepare your heart. And then I'll pray for us, and then we'll get everything started.    Father, we are here seeking to draw near and to meet you. We want to give you worship and sing praise to your name for you are worthy. And help the truths that we sing and the prayers that we pray be sincere and help us to mean the words that we lift up. Father, if our hearts have been far from you, I pray that you would draw near to us and rekindle the flame that is in our hearts. Lord, if we're here with great needs, I pray that your nearness would be evident so that we would be reminded that you are a good, good father that draws near to his people and is eager to hear and answer. Lord, we are here to worship. We're here to pray. Lord, would you help us not to do it just out of duty or function or religiosity, but help us really to engage tonight? And we ask these things in Jesus' name. I'm going to read a psalm, Psalm 57, 7 through 11. It says, "My heart is steadfast, O God. My heart is steadfast. I will sing. Yes, I will sing praises. Awake, my glory. Awake, harp and lyre. I will awaken the dawn. I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations. For your lovingkindness is great to the heavens and your truth to the clouds. Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Let your glory be above all the earth." And this is a psalm that's been turned into many different songs. And just, it's a, the words likely are very familiar to you guys. But the opening of this psalm actually tells us that it was written when David was in a cave. And he's fleeing for his life from Saul. And he believes wholeheartedly that God is sovereign and that God is good, no matter what the circumstances around him are telling him. And here in Psalm 57, the context is that David's good God, his sovereign God, has ordained some very harrowing times for the king. And regardless of the situation that he is in, David's committed to doing three things. He's committed to singing praises. He's committed to giving thanks. He's committed to exalting the Lord God Almighty. And you see that as you read through Psalm 57. And we come to pray tonight. And we come to give thanks tonight. We come to sing praises. And we come to exalt the Lord and worship. And before we sing, I want to remind us that we're approaching a thrice holy God, creator of the universe, who is worthy to be praised. But at the same time, we're approaching our Father. And we come to the throne of grace with boldness, right? But I hope that tonight, as we hear the word of God, as we sing, as we pray, that we don't forget that we exist for him. He does not exist to do our bidding. We are here to be recharged. And we are here to be reminded of our purpose. And we are here to just give glory to the Lord, no matter what circumstances you're in, whether you've had a great week in the Lord or whether you've struggled. We are here just to give God his due. And I'm going to read a Jonathan Edwards quote for you. It reads, "God's purpose for my life is that I have a passion for God's glory, and that I have a passion for my joy in that glory, and that these two are one passion." It's a little bit of a mouthful. But I hope and pray that whatever delights the heart of God is what truly brings us to life. Amen? So I'm going to invite you guys to stand with me. And we're going to start with a few songs of praise. Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth. Thou art exalted far above all gods. Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth. Thou art exalted far above all gods. I exalt thee. I exalt thee. I exalt thee. I exalt thee, O Lord. I exalt thee. I exalt thee. I exalt thee, O Lord. Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth. Thou art exalted far above all. Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth. Thou art exalted far above all gods. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee, O Lord. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. Oh, we exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee, O Lord. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee, O Lord. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. We exalt thee. Let all the earth rejoice. All the earth rejoice. He wraps himself in love. And on his rise to the high, trembles at his voice. Trembles at his voice. How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all is true. How great. How great is our God. And age to age he stands. And age to age he stands. Age to age he stands. And ties in his hands. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The God of every being and one.

Name above all names. Worthy of all praise. And my heart will sing. How great is our God. How great is our God. How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all is true. How great.

And sings my soul. My Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. And sings my soul. My Savior God to Thee. How great Thou art. How great Thou art. Amen. Please remain standing. I will read Psalm 103. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. And all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. And forget none of his benefits. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. And forget none of his benefits. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Bless the Lord, oh my soul.

Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. When the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to his mercy by the washing of regeneration and by the renewing, renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. There is nothing good in us outside of Christ and our only hope in this life is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen? And we're going to be singing about just the worthiness of God and of Jesus our Savior.     Who, oh Lord, could say themselves, Their own soul could break? Our shame was deeper than the sea, Your Grace is deeper still. Who, oh Lord, could say themselves, Their own soul could break? Our shame was deeper than the sea, Your Grace is deeper still. You alone can rescue, You alone can save, You alone can lift us from the grave. You came down to find us, Let us out of doubt, You alone belongs, The highest praise. Who, oh Lord, could say themselves, Who, oh Lord, could say themselves, Their own soul could break? Our shame was deeper than the sea, Your Grace is deeper still.

You alone belongs, The highest praise. You alone belongs, The highest praise. Alright, I invite you guys all to take a seat. We're going to go into our first, I guess, clump of time for you guys to pray. The first thing we're going to pray for, a lot of it is just related to our worship, the role of this church, and just in terms of how we've been doing spiritually. So, the first topic, the first item of prayer, I invite you to pray a prayer of confession, of your need for saving. And you can take time to confess to the Lord just the things that have been distracting you, the things that have been hindering your worship. And secondly, we're going to be praying a prayer of repentance in the areas of sin. And then, if you can pray for the leaders of the church that we will not turn from the left or to the right from the word, but we'll preach it and teach it accurately. And not only teach it, but also live it out with joy and passion. And please pray for that. And then, just pray that the Lord will raise up more biblically literate teachers and leaders in our church. Our church keeps growing, and we need servants. But more than that, we need people who are just faithful to the kingdom call, so pray for that. And then, lastly, if you can pray for just the upcoming Titus Bible study. If you are in a home group, also take time to pray for your home group leader. If you're going to be here on Wednesday, pray for your small group leader. In the Sunday school, all the kids also do Titus. And so, please pray that God would really teach our children from an early age how to handle His word, how to honor His word, how to study it. And so, the Sunday school teachers do play a big role in this. And so, I'm going to give you guys about 10 minutes just to lift these things up in prayer. And just whatever is on your mind also, just to lift those up to the Lord. And then, after about 10 minutes, we're going to just sing another song and reflect on just the goodness of our Lord. Okay, so we'll give you 10 minutes, and I'll make some kind of a noise. I'll tap the mic or something that Pastor Peter usually does. So, 10 minutes. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ >> And then we're going to take another few minutes just to pray for the next series of prayer requests. The first one, in about two weeks' time, we're going to be up in Palm Springs at the summer retreat. Pray for God to minister powerfully through Dr. John Street and that in the areas of just personal and just whatever reconciliation entails that we would grow in those areas. And so, pray for that. And also, we're going to take some time to pray for just the people in our lives who are sick, recently lost loved ones. This is just for you guys to be mindful of and pray for. Victor Wang's father just passed away about like 20 hours ago. So, please pray for him. And we do have a lot of different church people with family members who are ill. And so, let's pray for them as well. We do have a lot of people expecting and in the process of adoption as well. So, please pray that God will help them to become spiritually healthy parents, just spiritually vibrant parents and that we as a community would surround these parents and really just bless and pray over their children. At the same time, we do have a lot of couples in our church who are waiting for babies and the Lord hasn't said yet or said yes quite yet. So, if you know of them, just pray for them. That one, in his time that he would provide the gift of children and two, that while they wait, they would maximize their time in giving God glory in this season of life. So, pray for them. And also, just there are I'm sure people in your lives around you and even in our church who are spiritually drifting, who have been entangled, who are struggling and who personally have been in a relationship with God. And there are people who pretty much are on their way to turning their back on the Lord. So, just pray for those people. And that should keep you guys very engaged for the next 10 minutes or so. Just praying for all the different needs of our church and our people. So, we're going to take another 10 minutes just to lift up these prayer requests on the wall. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ I'm going to read Ephesians chapter 6, verses 10 to 13, and verse 18 for you. "Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm." And it goes on in verse 18, "With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints." So as you guys know, the theme for this year is "Watch and Pray." And if you guys are finding it difficult to pray, part of that is it may be very well connected to your watchfulness or your sobriety. Because as we discover that we're not being watchful, we're not being sober, and we are filling our hearts and our minds with the things of this world, it really is difficult to just pray with passion and with fervor. And here, the reminder is that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, the rulers, and the spiritual forces. And we do need to come together to pray because this is -- we cannot build our church by human effort or by leaning on just the backs of several people. This is a church that is only built up by the Spirit of the Lord. And so my encouragement is to keep praying, and in the strength of His might. And I'm going to read just one more passage for you, 1 Timothy 1:15. And this is for those of us who may be feeling discouraged. I'm having a hard time praying. I'm having a hard time engaging. And there are things that are going on in my life that haven't been fully dealt with, and I feel like I'm not worthy to be here. But this is a passage just to encourage you. It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. And as I mentioned before, there's absolutely nothing good in us outside of Christ. And praise God that He saved us while we were still wretches. And praise God that our salvation was not earned, but it's a free gift. And because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free, for God the just is satisfied to look on Him in part of me. And before we go into our third time of prayer, I want us to sing this just to be reminded of our identity in Christ.                       - And we're gonna go into our third little time of praying for the different topics. The first one is we do have a cafe night that's gonna be held across the courtyard tomorrow. This is not an invitation for you to come to support it. It's just something that we would like you to pray over, to pray for, and we wanna keep it intimate, and so that the people who are bringing the nonbelieving friends will hear the gospel, and seeds will be planted in their hearts. So let's pray for fertile soil. Let's pray for questions to be answered, and the performers and the musicians, it's--there is a lot of pressure, and I'm sure they're gonna be thinking, like, "I gotta perform well to not hinder the evening," but let's pray for the performers, that they will be able to just worship and to just feel free there. So let's pray for them and that God would use them just to really minister well tomorrow night. We're also gonna be praying for our India pastors, and that God would fill them with overflowing joy, with boldness, and with a passion for preaching. If you guys have been there, my encouragement is pray for those pastors that you know by name. Pray that just the word will be preached accurately and clearly, and that people will come to know the Lord. And so let's pray for strength to persevere, and pray for spiritual leaders to be raised up, and for the lost in the Indian villages to come to know Christ intimately. So let's pray for them. Pray for our church to be a healthy community that equips and sends out workers into the harvest fields that are both local and global. We cannot go out being biblically illiterate because that's just ignorance on fire, and then that spreads ignorance on fire. Let's pray that as we are growing in the Lord, as we are growing in skill to handling His word, that people will go out really to proclaim His word to our Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. So let's pray that we are a missionary-raising church. So let's pray for those things. And I'll give you about 10 minutes. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ All right, for this last chunk of time, we're gonna just pray for one another. We're gonna break up into groups of three or four. And I wanna read you this quote. "The underlying purpose of God in the world is the glory of God." Charles Ryrie. And as you are breaking up into groups of three and four, and I know you probably have a bunch of things that you need prayer over. There are things that you hope that happens in your life, attitudes you want changed in different circumstances you need wisdom in. But the thing that I would like us to share with one another is in what areas of my life do I need help in surrendering to and glorifying God? 'Cause our struggle is not against flesh and blood. It is not our effort that attains spiritual maturity. It is strictly by the grace of God. And so let's take some time to just share and just share this. Whatever, if you have time to squeeze in other prayer requests by all means, whatever's pressing by all means. But really what I would want us to just pray over for one another is that question. Where do I need help? And so let's pray for that. And then after about 10 minutes, I'll have you all stand and we'll do our final closing praise. (soft music) so you can hear it both ears. So don't push it in all the way. I think all the lessons I learned, a lot of that feedback in the business of the industry, and the retreat, all put together, it sacked me with a lot of energy. I went to a summer retreat, because I'm the speaker for the kids, and I'm running it. I need to have a little bit of fun.     Me? Yeah.  What do I need help with? What is there? We don't have enough time. I was thinking, my brain's kind of all scattered, like scatterbrained recently, just thinking about a bunch of different things. And I've been waking up early, but my prayer and devotion times has been, I'll say distracted, but it hasn't been focused the way I want it to. So it's been kind of like this hills and valleys of priorities that I'm thinking about. And then there's so much flooding in of work and other responsibilities. And then I was thinking, why is this? Why is that happening? I can't pinpoint it. A thought that came into my mind was, well, I'm on that latter half of my life. You know what I mean? I was thinking of-- Midlife crisis? Yeah, midlife crisis. Is it a midlife crisis? What is it? I don't want to go buy a car. I know I do. But I just need help in just really living the rest of my life and the good, strengthening years that my body's still functioning well, and to do it well. I know that's very generic, but that's what I've been thinking about. Is it this umbrella of-- I don't want to say worry, but am I wasting my life, in a sense? Am I wasting my time? Could I be doing more? I feel great for that. And my kids-- and part of that umbrella is my kids' salvation. CJ's 13. I still can say he's probably not a Christian. I accepted Christ when I was a sixth grader, but obviously I wasn't mature back then. But at least for the most part, they're open and saying, no, we're not Christian. I don't know if I believe God. I can't see Him. Those are the kind of big statements I get.                                              All right, if I can have you just come back to your seats and turn around, face the front. And we're going to close with just a final reading of his word. And this is a command in charge of our Lord.  All right, Philippians 4, 4 through 9 reads, "Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say, rejoice. Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things. The things that you've learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things. And the God of peace will be with you." It's a command, rejoice in the Lord always. Amen? And joy is not an emotion. It's the condition and an attitude of the heart that understands that God, when he's in his rightful place, all is well. And can I invite you guys all to stand? And this is a song that's actually kind of hard to end. And so just I hope that as we sing this song with hearts of celebration, it might end kind of awkwardly. And if that's the case, just shout hallelujah. And then we'll go from there. And then after we sing, Elder Joe is going to wrap up our time in prayer.  When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me with the utmost. When I think about the Lord, how he picked me up, turned me around, and he set my feet on solid ground. Make sure you watch out. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, for you're worthy of all the glory, all the honor, all the praise. When I think about the Lord, when I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the utmost. When I think about the Lord, how he picked me up, turned me around, how he set my feet on solid ground. Make sure you watch out. Hallelujah.

Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory, all the honor, all the praise. Make sure you watch out. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory, all the honor, all the praise. Amen. Let's close in prayer. God, we thank you for the fellowship we have in Christ. We thank you for bringing your church together to pray in one voice, to lift up our hearts together, and beseech you, Lord God, for many various things going on in our own lives, in our own church, and the world. Lord, help us to see with your eyes what you see. Help us to see the lost around us. Help us, Lord God, to have your heart and your compassion. Give us zeal for you, Lord God. Help us to watch our own lives, that we can be ready and willing to pray. Lord, we need your strength. We need your spirit. So we ask, Lord God, that you continue to build this church, build up each and every believer in this room. Help us to trust you fully, that our hearts may love you, Lord God, and honor you with our lips, with our lives, that we represent you to this world, and that you may ultimately be pleased with what we give and what we sacrifice. We love you, Lord God. We ask that you continue, Lord God, to strengthen and establish your church by your ways and your power. So we entrust our lives to you at this time to you. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen. Have a good evening. See you guys Sunday.</p></div></body></html>
