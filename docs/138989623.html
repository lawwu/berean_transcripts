You've heard probably sermons on it, Bible studies. And it is really at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=123s">00:02:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the core of what Paul is trying to say through this whole book. So his conclusion or his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=129s">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thesis is summed up in these two verses. So we talked about how Paul is about to jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=135s">00:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in to the heart of the message of the gospel starting from verse 18. But before doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=140s">00:02:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from verses 1 through 17, he's laying out his ministry. He introduces himself as a servant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=147s">00:02:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">who has been appointed as an apostle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And then he talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=151s">00:02:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about this gospel of his son Jesus Christ that was proclaimed and given to the Jews</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=157s">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning in the Old Testament. And then we talked about his ministry, his attitude, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=161s">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">how personal it was and how he was constantly in prayer wanting to strengthen the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=166s">00:02:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we looked at it a couple weeks ago how Paul says he was obligated both to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=170s">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Greeks and to the barbarians. And then we talked about that how sometimes when we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=175s">00:02:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of obligation we think of burden, but instead Paul ends that section by saying, "I am eager."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=181s">00:03:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of this obligation of the gospel, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=185s">00:03:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">who are in Rome. And he continues this thought of him being eager to preach the gospel in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=191s">00:03:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">verse 16 where he says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel." So in essence he's saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=196s">00:03:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. Whether you say it by saying, "I am bold. I am eager to preach." Or saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=200s">00:03:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that, "I am not ashamed to preach." In the end what he's saying is, "I am compelled to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=205s">00:03:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">do this. That this ministry that I am a part of to spread the gospel is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=210s">00:03:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is compelling inside of me no matter what. And I am not ashamed." Paul says, "I am not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=215s">00:03:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ashamed of the gospel," because that was not the norm. You know typically we think of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=221s">00:03:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">early church and we think of thousands of Apostle Pauls running around planting churches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=226s">00:03:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">everywhere he goes. But the reason why he says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel," is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=230s">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are many people who were ashamed. The typical thing that we see in the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=237s">00:03:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we often times think that revival breaks out and all these people going out and bearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=241s">00:04:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of fruit. But if you look at church history from the very beginning of the preaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=245s">00:04:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gospel with the Apostles it was typically a few men bearing a lot of fruit instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=252s">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people bearing a few fruit. And so we see Paul encouraging the church to not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=260s">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to be ashamed, to be bold in preaching the gospel because many of them were not. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=265s">00:04:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">claimed the faith in Jesus Christ but they kept it to themselves. They kind of kept it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=269s">00:04:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in their little things and they went to church but they weren't bearing fruit. They weren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=275s">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bold for Christ. In fact at the end of Paul's life, remember when we were studying through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=279s">00:04:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">2 Timothy, Paul's primary message to his protege that as he is departing is to plead with his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=287s">00:04:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">disciple that you would not turn from your faith like all these other men that have gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=293s">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">before you. That all these people that have traveled with me and preached in the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=297s">00:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and now that I'm headed to prison and possibly be executed that some of them were ashamed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=303s">00:05:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of them saw the consequences of what they were doing. They were beginning to fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=308s">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">out. In our generation we have the same issue. You know exactly what percentage of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=318s">00:05:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">who claim to be Christians are actively involved in sharing their faith. Now we can make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=323s">00:05:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">mistake in thinking that if you're part of a church that does missions that somehow you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=327s">00:05:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are doing missions. That if you're friends or if you're part of a group that we're part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=331s">00:05:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of that. I don't want to get to the exact numbers but we know that it's very small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=336s">00:05:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That very few people even in our generation is actively involved in sharing this message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=343s">00:05:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So what Paul has to say to the Romans, what Paul had to say to the early church and to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=347s">00:05:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Timothy is very relevant today. That we ought not to be ashamed of the gospel. We ought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=353s">00:05:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to be eager to preach the gospel. Now why were they ashamed? What are some of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=359s">00:05:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that caused them to be timid in sharing the gospel? Well let me say right off the bat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=364s">00:06:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't persecuted because they were good people. Again we have a lot of stirring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=370s">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up in our generation where it's almost a thing to do and thing to say. That social justice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=378s">00:06:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we ought to be. And so there's been a lot of stirring up in the last 10 to 15</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=384s">00:06:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">years. This conversation of wanting to help the poor and you know doing building bridges</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=390s">00:06:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or water pumps and all this stuff. And all of those things are fantastic. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=395s">00:06:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely necessary because that ought to be the character of a Christian. That we ought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=400s">00:06:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be concerned for people who are suffering. But that was not the reason why the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=405s">00:06:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">church was persecuted.

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=430s">00:07:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">know, he fed the poor.

In John 10.33, the Jews talking to Jesus says, "It is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=443s">00:07:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy.

What is so offensive of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=466s">00:07:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel that it's offensive?

What is the offense of the gospel? That so many people who claim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=500s">00:08:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to know Jesus and to claim to believe in this truth are unwilling to share this. Well, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=509s">00:08:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel itself, right off the bat, is offensive. Very first thing about the gospel is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=513s">00:08:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">offensive. Today, you know, we have this movement of being gospel-centered, but oftentimes when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=518s">00:08:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody says gospel-centered, they're talking about the very end part of the gospel. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=523s">00:08:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">know, they're talking about how we've sinned and no matter what you do, Jesus loves you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=528s">00:08:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and He died for you. It doesn't matter what you do because it's only what He did. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=533s">00:08:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're talking about the very end part where He forgives your sin. And so you can do whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=537s">00:08:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you want.

Why would the message of universal love, unconditional,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=547s">00:09:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">no matter what you do, you have a free ticket to Heaven if you say you believe in Jesus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=552s">00:09:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would that be so offensive? But when you take a careful look at the gospel, Paul's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=556s">00:09:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about to jump in to the depth of the gospel starting from verse 18. And we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=561s">00:09:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">get into that next week. But verse 18, he begins a clear and thorough presentation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=567s">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel by saying, "For the wrath of God is being revealed in Heaven against all ungodliness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=573s">00:09:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth." The beginning of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=579s">00:09:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel presents and clarifies where we stand before Him. We are not neutral, the scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=586s">00:09:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">says. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. So the first three chapters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=592s">00:09:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul digs in to the depth of depravity of mankind. So by the time you get to chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=597s">00:09:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">3, verse 10, I mean if you haven't been offended by then, you will definitely be offended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=602s">00:10:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to go there now.

God is not happy with you. God is angry. The wrath of God is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=617s">00:10:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">being revealed. Those of you who have the law, you're guilty with the law. Those of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=622s">00:10:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you who don't have the law, you're guilty without the law. We're all guilty under God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=627s">00:10:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We're all guilty of judgment. So to a humanist, it is extremely offensive to sit down with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=636s">00:10:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody and to tell them that God is not happy with you. When all the message that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=641s">00:10:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we are receiving in our generation is just self-esteem, you know, you're good. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=648s">00:10:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at the core of who you are, you're good. And that's why God saw something precious in you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=652s">00:10:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why he loved you. That's why he pursued you. But that's not what the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=656s">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">says. The Bible said his pursuit was despite our ugliness, despite our rejection, despite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=663s">00:11:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where we stood before God, he came after us. So the very beginning of the message is offensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=671s">00:11:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">At the heart of the gospel message is the identity of Jesus Christ. That Jesus Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=676s">00:11:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the Son of God and he is God himself. He made that very clear. He said, "Before Abraham</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=682s">00:11:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was I am." He was saying that the God of the Old Testament that these Jews bowed down and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=687s">00:11:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">worshipped was him. And later on Paul clarifies that everything was made by him and for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=697s">00:11:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the heart of the gospel message is that Jesus Christ is God. Now that is offensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=703s">00:11:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to all kinds of people. It's offensive to Muslims. It offends Jehovah's Witnesses. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=710s">00:11:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you sit down and talk with them and detail what they mean by that, they're offended by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=713s">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that. In fact a while back I was trying to share the gospel with this Jewish lady and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=719s">00:11:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as I was talking I quoted the New Testament. I said, "The New Testament." And then she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=724s">00:12:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just stopped. She said, "Peter, what you said to me was very offensive." And I said, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=729s">00:12:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do you mean?" She said, "We don't believe in the New Testament. We only read the Old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=735s">00:12:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament." Obviously she doesn't call it Old Testament. She calls it the Torah. "We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=739s">00:12:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">only believe in the Torah. And it's offensive to me when you call it the New Testament."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=744s">00:12:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the back of my mind I was thinking I'm very offended by what you just said. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=748s">00:12:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know what I mean? I'm offended that you're offended. But just to mention that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=754s">00:12:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a New Testament, obviously that Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all these prophecies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=758s">00:12:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was offensive to her. In fact, again at the heart of the gospel message and why these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=764s">00:12:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things are necessary that all have sin and that Jesus Christ the Son of God and the crux</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=771s">00:12:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of this gospel message is that Jesus Christ crucified is the only salvation for mankind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=778s">00:12:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Only salvation. If you say that Jesus Christ is a Savior that doesn't offend a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=783s">00:13:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, "Oh, that works for you." Right? And I'm glad that you believe that. But once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=789s">00:13:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you begin to proclaim what Jesus meant by it when He said, "I am the way and the truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=792s">00:13:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and life. Nobody comes to the Father but through me." In Acts chapter 4, 12, "And there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=800s">00:13:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation in no one else. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=805s">00:13:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which we must be saved." In our pluralistic, relativistic society to make an absolute claim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=815s">00:13:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jesus being the only way. Maybe there's some of you sitting here thinking, "You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=819s">00:13:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what? You can preach Jesus. You can preach about what He did. You can preach about His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=823s">00:13:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">love and even His holiness. But once you begin to say that He's the exclusive only way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=829s">00:13:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">salvation, that's arrogant. Maybe you can say, you know, that, "Maybe the Bible says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=834s">00:13:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this but I'm not really that convinced." Or maybe, you know, who knows God's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=839s">00:13:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be the judge and that seems to be the popular way that a lot of these televangelists seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=843s">00:14:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to answer questions. You know, "Do you really believe that a Muslim can't be saved or a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=849s">00:14:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Jehovah Witness or a Buddhist can't be saved?" And a lot of the way that these people answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=855s">00:14:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these questions because they know the kind of response they're going to get from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=858s">00:14:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">world. "Oh, you know, we preach the love of Christ but I don't want to be the judge. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=864s">00:14:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to leave the judgment to God." Well, God did make a judgment and that's why we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=868s">00:14:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have the Word of God. And Scripture made that absolutely crystal clear. So at the core of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=873s">00:14:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the Gospel, when you are preaching and teaching what it says, it is very offensive. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=880s">00:14:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">moment you try to make the Gospel less offensive by tweaking the Gospel in such a way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=886s">00:14:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't sound as offensive is no longer the Gospel. And so I have to say in many circles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=894s">00:14:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">even under the term evangelical Christians, that this has happened because we're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=899s">00:14:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">very hard not to make the offense. We can talk about Jesus without offending people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=905s">00:15:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We can talk about salvation of sin without offending people. We can talk about the exclusivicity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=910s">00:15:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ without offending people, if that was even possible. See, this preaching of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=917s">00:15:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the Gospel has never been accepted by the majority. It's never been a situation where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=925s">00:15:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all people who are claiming to be Christians were out there proclaiming the Gospel and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=930s">00:15:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of fruit came from a lot of people. If you look at church history, you'll always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=934s">00:15:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">find a few people who are not ashamed of the Gospel bearing a lot of fruit. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=941s">00:15:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what's happening here with Paul. Paul's trying to encourage this church and the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=946s">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">church to gear up for this struggle. And so Paul says, again at the end of verse 13, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=954s">00:15:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "I'm eager to preach the Gospel." And then he, verse 16, he says the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=958s">00:15:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the opposite way, "I am not ashamed of preaching the Gospel." In other words, he's declaring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=963s">00:16:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is why I'm so bold.

That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1650s">00:27:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the greatest display.

Christ crucified.

He is absolutely convinced of this truth. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1830s">00:30:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel, he says in verse 17, not only does it save, he says it reveals the righteousness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1834s">00:30:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of God from faith to faith. Typically, when we think about the gospel, we think it reveals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1840s">00:30:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">His mercy, right? It's like, "Ah, you know, the gospel shows His mercy and His grace and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1846s">00:30:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">His patience with sinners." But we don't typically think about righteousness being displayed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1852s">00:30:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by the gospel, right? We think of grace, mercy. So what does he mean when he says the gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1861s">00:31:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is the revelation of God's righteousness? What does that mean? God's righteousness is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1866s">00:31:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">displayed in two ways. One, the gospel, the cross, reveals His nature of righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1876s">00:31:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me explain what I mean by that. The scripture says very clearly that God's nature cannot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1882s">00:31:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be changed. In fact, Hebrews 6, 17-18, let me read that for you. "So when God desired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1887s">00:31:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1891s">00:31:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">His purpose, He guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1896s">00:31:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1901s">00:31:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to hold fast to the hope set before." So let me summarize what he says here. There's two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1905s">00:31:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things that he cannot do. One, he cannot change his nature and he cannot lie, which in essence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1910s">00:31:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is the same thing.

He didn't all of a sudden decide, you know what, I'm just going to forget about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1927s">00:32:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it. All the warnings that he gave to the Old Testament believers and saying, you know what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1932s">00:32:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you obey my commands, here's some blessing that's going to come to you.

And all of a sudden Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1941s">00:32:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">shows up and He says, you know what, I know I said all of these things, just forget about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1946s">00:32:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

Which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1950s">00:32:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people think that that's what the gospel is, right?

So we have a tendency to think that in the Old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1959s">00:32:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament God was very harsh and He was judgmental and He was righteous and He's angry. He comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1965s">00:32:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to the New Testament, He's just like, He's almost like we have a sanctified God, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=1970s">00:32:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He's sanctified.

He didn't just simply say, he snapped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2047s">00:34:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fingers and said, okay, okay, you know, I'm just going to forget about all your sins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2052s">00:34:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">God cannot deny Himself. There's nothing that He does where His holiness and His love is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2059s">00:34:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in somehow contradiction. See at the cross is where His holiness and His love is displayed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2068s">00:34:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to the greatest. Let me explain. When Jesus was going to the cross, Jesus said, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2077s">00:34:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to glorify you. And Father, it's time for you to glorify the Son. So at the cross, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2083s">00:34:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is glorified and the Son is glorified. And how was He being glorified? There's two natures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2091s">00:34:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">nature of God. And really it's the same nature, but it's a two nature displayed where His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2097s">00:34:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness and His love. It says God is holy. God is love. Now sometimes we think, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2102s">00:35:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">either you're love or you're holy, you can't go hand in hand. But the cross was the perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2108s">00:35:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">display of His holiness. So when we think about His holiness, where is His holiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2115s">00:35:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the greatest of display? It's at the cross. Because at the cross where all of His wrath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2125s">00:35:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the judgment of mankind, past, present and future that He has elected was at display,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2133s">00:35:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">putting it upon Jesus. You remember when Jesus, when God was angry with the nations and He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2140s">00:35:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was angry with them and He brought the flood? Yeah, I mean we would think, well, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2143s">00:35:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the greatest display of His righteous anger. But that was only anger for them. That was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2149s">00:35:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">only justice for them. At the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the wrath of past, present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2157s">00:35:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and future of all generations. So it is at the cross where we see the greatest display</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2163s">00:36:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of His righteousness. And as it's being displayed, on the flip side of that, that as He absorbs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2172s">00:36:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it, the greatest display of His love. You know, we often think about Jesus, how He humbled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2178s">00:36:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Himself and He washed the disciples' feet. And yes, I mean, yes, that was very humble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2183s">00:36:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was a very great display. But that was for the disciples. That was for them at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2188s">00:36:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that time. But the greatest display of His grace and mercy was at the cross, when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2195s">00:36:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">was the darkest. And so when we think about, well, who is God? What is the greatest thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2203s">00:36:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you and I ought to think of? It's the cross. Let me give you an example. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2210s">00:36:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about, you know, I don't remember the details, but there are some games that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2213s">00:36:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Michael Jordan played. And I know some of you guys say, "Oh, it's Kobe, Michael Jordan."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2217s">00:36:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so let's end this debate now, okay? It's Michael Jordan. All right, so there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2222s">00:37:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some games that Michael Jordan played that it was just ridiculous. And I don't remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2226s">00:37:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the details, but when you think about and say, "Hey, what's the display?" When there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2229s">00:37:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this argument between Kobe and Michael Jordan, like, okay, so you say he's the greatest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2234s">00:37:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, prove it, right? Well, how do you prove it? You look at the game that he played that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2242s">00:37:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">magnifies his skills, right? And the greater the opposition, well, you know, Michael Jordan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2248s">00:37:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">came into this game and this other team, they had the best record of that season. Everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2253s">00:37:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thought that they were going to win. Michael Jordan was actually sick that day. He had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2257s">00:37:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a 102 fever and he barely was walking that morning. And, you know, and he had tragic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2263s">00:37:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things happening in his life and everybody thought that there's no way that he had any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2267s">00:37:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">chance. And then he comes in and he scores 60 points and then he wins the game winning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2271s">00:37:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shot with four guys defending him with his eyes closed. You know what I mean? So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2277s">00:37:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about the greatness of Michael Jordan and his basketball skills, we look at a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2284s">00:38:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">game where this greatest access is displayed. And that's where we go when we say, "Here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2292s">00:38:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Michael Jordan." And you look at that, that's why we think he's the greatest. So when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2296s">00:38:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">think about God, when we display God, when we present God, where do we go to present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2302s">00:38:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">God? Where is his greatest attribute at greatest display? It's at the cross. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2312s">00:38:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what Paul is saying, that not only is it the power of God to save, but the righteousness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2317s">00:38:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, his nature is at the greatest display at the cross. Not only is his nature displayed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2326s">00:38:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but because of his nature of righteousness being displayed, is that we've been affected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2331s">00:38:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">2 Corinthians 5.21, "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2338s">00:38:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">him we might become the righteousness of God." That in his righteousness displayed. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2344s">00:39:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference between glorifying the world and glorifying Christ. We can glorify Michael</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2352s">00:39:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Jordan, put him on a pedestal, and we may find some satisfaction in doing that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2357s">00:39:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're creatures of worship. But at the end of the day, there's emptiness. There's artificial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2366s">00:39:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">joy. But the scripture says when we magnify Christ and his righteousness, we're affected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2373s">00:39:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">His righteousness becomes imputed to us. Not only do we display his glory, that in displaying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2378s">00:39:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">his glory, we are affected. And that's why Paul is saying, "I am not ashamed of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2386s">00:39:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel. That's why I am bold to proclaim this gospel." So we're bold about Lakers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2393s">00:39:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we're bold about Golden State Warriors, we're bold about some football teams, baseball teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2401s">00:40:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all artificial, all superficial.

Being affected by this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2418s">00:40:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">truth is what gives us boldness. But let me, I told you that's my first point. The second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2424s">00:40:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">point, and I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this, is the second reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2428s">00:40:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he was bold is because he genuinely loved them. You can have all the truth and be convicted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2435s">00:40:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of all of this and just not care. It's like, "Ah, okay, whatever." You know, you're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2440s">00:40:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, you believe it. That's good for you." But maybe you're convicted about it, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2444s">00:40:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't care if somebody is saved or not. Paul was bold because he genuinely desired them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2452s">00:40:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to be saved. He was convinced that the only salvation for mankind is the gospel of Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2456s">00:40:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, and he desired so much for people to be saved. Romans 9, 1-3, Paul says, "I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2465s">00:41:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">am speaking the truth in Christ.

If it's a sister, brother, father, mother, and say, "Hey, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2576s">00:42:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">These are consequences. Maybe you shouldn't be doing that." And they say, "Hey, hey, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2581s">00:43:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">don't judge me." It's like, "What are you talking about? You know, I just want you to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2584s">00:43:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to make sure that you're doing the right thing." And you would be a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2586s">00:43:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">more bold to speak the truth. But if that was your child, if that was your son or your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2594s">00:43:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">daughter making that mistake and going down the wrong path, and it's absolutely unacceptable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2599s">00:43:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the consequences that's going to come their way, we will become emboldened to speak to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2606s">00:43:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Because it's not acceptable, the consequence. You over there, you say, "You know what? I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2613s">00:43:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">don't want to be judgmental." And all of a sudden, you will be judgmental. "Oh, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2618s">00:43:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">want to rock the world.

It's like, no matter how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2621s">00:43:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">feel about me, you can't keep doing this.

So when Paul says, "I am enduring all things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2635s">00:43:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for the sake of the elect," it's because he not only is convicted about these truths,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2641s">00:44:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">he desired so much for them to come to Christ as well. And that's why he says, "If I'm being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2648s">00:44:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">selfish, I'd rather die.

Now, did Paul have this love the moment he met Christ? No. He hated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2662s">00:44:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the Gentiles. In the context of obedience, God gave him love. So it was this love that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2672s">00:44:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">compelled him. What gives us boldness?

But really, enough to be uncomfortable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/138989623#t=2690s">00:44:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">enough to overcome awkwardness?
