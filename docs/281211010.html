href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=236s">00:03:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">everywhere he is going, he's been persecuted, possibility of death, eventually he gets beheaded</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=243s">00:04:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But he says the reason why he spoke with boldness was because there was clarity that he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=248s">00:04:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking on God's behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=258s">00:04:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a direct revelation that he got from God, and he clearly knew who he was serving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=264s">00:04:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">even if it was at the point of death.</span></div><div

the main point, main thing that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=276s">00:04:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">going to stay at this

href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=293s">00:04:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Romans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

gospel so they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=307s">00:05:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">repent and be justified of their

"First, I thank my God through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=315s">00:05:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ for all of you,

church we hear Paul saying this is the church of Thessalonica, because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=326s">00:05:26.720</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=331s">00:05:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to the gospel was exemplary, that even before Paul would go to distant parts of Macedonia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=337s">00:05:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the news about their conversion went ahead of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=341s">00:05:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Paul used the same words to describe the Roman Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281211010#t=345s">00:05:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">He hasn't come to this church, but he heard of them.</span></div><div
