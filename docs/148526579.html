Peter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2098s">00:34:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is not into details. Peter is like, "Let's do it!

I mean, zealot, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2147s">00:35:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of the first people that he would have killed was a tax collector.

He put Judas, and you had these guys. If you left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2166s">00:36:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">James and John alone, they would have been mass murderers. They were in Samaria. "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2170s">00:36:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">these guys won't accept us.

You know what I mean? And so you have those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2180s">00:36:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">12 people. I think when Peter was asking the question seven times, I think, I have a feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2184s">00:36:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that he already did it seven times. So Jesus said seven times, like, "Yes! This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2191s">00:36:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">eighth time. Now I'm going to get this guy." Right? So Peter asked him seven times, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2197s">00:36:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus said, "Seven times seventy." Like, "Oh my gosh. That's going to take forever." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2203s">00:36:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously you know the point that Jesus is trying to get to. And then it's in that context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2207s">00:36:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">he tells this illustration. He tells a story about a servant who owed all this money. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2213s">00:36:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the money that he describes is 10,000 talents. One talent is equivalent at that time to 15</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2223s">00:37:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">years of labor. 15 years of labor. We're talking about 150,000 years of labor. Now, Jesus was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2231s">00:37:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">exaggerating. You know, you could have said, "Oh, he owed a couple million." He said, "He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2235s">00:37:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">owed trillions of dollars." Who lent him this money? I don't know. But you know what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2244s">00:37:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">describing here, right? When he's describing the money that he lent, he's describing sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2250s">00:37:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? He's describing sin. He's saying this guy was forgiven 150,000 years of labor, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2259s">00:37:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">then he is let go, and then there's another servant. His servant comes around, and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2263s">00:37:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">owed 100 denarii. A hundred denarii was worth about 18 days. $18 a day for about 100 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2273s">00:37:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're talking about maybe 3, 4, 5 months or something like that of labor. And it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2278s">00:37:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">trivial compared to. So there's a reason why he exaggerates the amount the first one owed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2285s">00:38:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">versus the second one. Because the exact point that he was trying to get at is, "You were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2290s">00:38:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">forgiven this much sin, and yet for a few months' worth of salary, you're willing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2296s">00:38:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">beat him and put him in prison?" And so he said, "Then the master called the servant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2301s">00:38:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in, 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all the debt yours because you begged me to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2308s">00:38:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on you?'

Now you know who he was talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148526579#t=2330s">00:38:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to? Peter.
