Kenya, he's kind of taking steps as he gets closer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=180s">00:03:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">63, 64, and

know, I've had many friends in the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=187s">00:03:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but those roommates that I had, you know, every time, whether we meet once a year or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=192s">00:03:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">every couple of years, when they come back in furlough, you know, it's like old times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=196s">00:03:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, back when we lived together, we spent about three to four, maybe five years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=201s">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">together, living together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=203s">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have obviously very specific memories that we have, praying together, witnessing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=207s">00:03:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">together, spending late nights just talking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=210s">00:03:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, even though they're significantly older than I am, they're good friends that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=215s">00:03:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we're probably going to keep in touch for the rest of our

point in my life, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/308618667#t=222s">00:03:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a short period, it's been
