As you guys remember, on Sunday, Jesus enters into Jerusalem riding on a donkey and preparing for what he's been telling his disciples that he was gonna do on Friday. Monday, he comes into the temple and he cleanses the temple. And the cleansing of the temple does two things. One, he reminds his disciples how the zeal for his Father's house was gonna consume him, meaning the whole reason why Christ came was to restore a broken worship. And so it left an impression not only on his disciples, but everyone who was there, how important worship was and how important worship is. But the other aspect of what the cleansing of the temple did was it agitated the leaders. And so if he was going to be crucified, and as he said, by the hands of the leaders of Israel, he basically made a public statement. And he basically challenged them in their home, in their comfort zone, where their power relied on, was at the temple. And he enters into the temple, and when he flips over the tables, he wasn't just flipping over the tables of the people who were taking advantage of that. He was basically publicly challenging the leaders for allowing this to happen. And so as a result of that, they know exactly where he is. And they know where to get him. So they've been trying to plan this, but for the first time, he's in their territory, and this begins a series of events that's going to eventually lead him to the cross. Tuesday is a day where he spends teaching his disciples to prepare for what's coming. So we could say that this was sort of his last sermon that he gives to his disciples. So today, as we gather together and meditate on the steps that Jesus took, that we remember that every single thing that Jesus does this week is very purposeful, and to prepare all the disciples, prepare everyone who has come, and even us today, as we ready our hearts, that we step through these seats, and not just to observe it as something that happened thousands of years ago, but really be able to connect with Christ in the steps that he takes us. So imagine what he must have been going through knowing that the crucifixion is coming in just a few days, knowing that his disciples that he loves are gonna betray him, that people who yelled out "Hosanna" are gonna turn against him, and that his own father that he loves so dearly, that he's gonna be hanging on the cross and crying out, "Why have you forsaken me?" And so, as we follow the footsteps of Christ, that we don't, again, just look at the superficial things that are just watching from a distance, but that we would also walk with him, you know, in mind, in heart, in footstep, so that as we get to the point of the cross, that we would have had the whole week to think, and step by step to lead us there as Christ did. So let me pray for us, and then we'll take time to worship, and then our sister Janelee's gonna come, and she's gonna give her testimony, and then we'll walk through Jesus's life on Tuesday. Okay, let's pray. Gracious Father, Lord, when we meditate on how deliberate you are, and how deliberate this last week of Jesus's earthly life was, knowing the suffering that is coming, how he chose to walk into Jerusalem, challenge the leaders, prepare his disciples, and all the while being worried, Lord God, for us, I pray, Father, that you would stir us, consume us, revive us, as we walk with you this week. Let our praise be from our hearts. Let our worship be in spirit and in truth. And that your suffering for us would lead us to greater worship, greater obedience, and greater love for you. In Jesus's name we pray, amen. Let us all rise, let us all rise as we sing these praises.

Hi, everybody. Hi, Brian family. My name is Jenny Lee, and I've been at Brian for the last two and a half years as part of the band ministry. And I'm really thankful to be here and to be sharing with you guys and just on what God's been teaching me this past year. PPC mentioned on Palm Sunday how Passion Week was one of the most hardest and loneliest week for Christ. And that resonated a lot with me because this year has been especially painful. I had, because I lost my mom unexpectedly and suddenly, she was also my best friend. And so she was 82, but if you met her, you would have thought she was a lot younger 'cause she had such a vibrant and youthful spirit about her. And she would have been one of the funniest people you guys would have met. And so I thought in my head, I was like, oh, she's gonna live well into her 90s. And so I'm thankful that my mom was a believer and that she's celebrating in heaven. But my brother and I do kind of struggle a lot with, there's so many different feelings of sorrow and doubt and anxiety and fear. And while I don't completely understand why things happen so suddenly, God has been encouraging me with three different truths through this loss. The first truth is that God indeed loves me and he is my ultimate comforter in this pain. There's a lot of, yeah, I was doubting a lot. It's like, does God really love me? Am I just a pawn in this game of life? And I was comforted by Matthew 5, 4, which says, "Blessed are those who mourn "for they shall be comforted." And I have been praying this daily for myself and my family. And God has answered that so much through you guys. I feel like the church family has been such the hands and feet of Jesus during this time. When things happened so quickly and we had to plan our celebration, yeah, my brother and I and my dad were just so stressed out and everybody was so willing to serve and to just come alongside of us, whether it was to help us with taking pictures or help us with money, sound, and just even just showing up. And during the week leading, even the whole month, everybody wanted to drop us off food. So we had massive amounts of food. We had all this boba and we had flowers and we had a lot of Korean food, boiling crab. And at a certain point, and my dad especially loved the chili cheese fries from Del Taco. Ashley, you know who you are. But at one point he was like, "Can you tell your friends to stop bringing food? "There's too much food." So just really that love that came from you guys is just a reflection of there's Christ's love through you guys. I was also encouraged by just all the messages that we got and all the cards and just being so encouraged that you guys are really encouraging me through God's love and God's truth. And during our Thessalonian study last year, we had memorized this verse and it really came a lot more alive during this time. And that's 2 Thessalonians 2.16. Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us, and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word. This verse has comforted me and it's a powerful reminder that during the season, even though the world will throw a lot of trials upon you that you don't expect, I'm strengthened that God, through Jesus Christ, he loves me and he has given me eternal comfort that the world can't provide. The second thing that God has been encouraging me with is that he has been wanting me to long for heaven. When I lost my mom, I had this whole, and I still do, this void in my heart. And I started thinking a lot more about heaven. I was thinking and yeah, I remember talking to Elder James about heaven too, just like, oh, what is heaven like? And what is she doing? I mean, every day I'm like, what is she doing up there? And can she hear me? And I have to admit, before this happened, and we went through Thessalonians Bible study last year, that I really didn't have a longing for heaven. It was just a very pie in the sky concept for me. And it felt like something I knew in my heart, but not in my head. And so though I don't have all the answers of heaven explained, I definitely long for heaven a lot more and I look forward to being reunited with both Christ and my mom. One of the verses that really spoke to me a lot during the season is 1 Corinthians 15, 54 through 57. It's kind of long, but it's a really powerful passage. And it's, death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where is your victory? Oh death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. I kind of struggle a lot with the concept of death, even though we know where we go after we die, and even the word funeral, 'cause it just made it sound like death was so final, but it's not. You know, these verses have encouraged me that death is definitely a consequence of our sin and the fact that we live in a broken world. But as Christians, it's more of a homecoming. You know, and so it's, if we believe that Jesus Christ is our Savior, we know that he died for our sins, he's given us, my mom and I, victory, all of us victory over death. So that's really comforted me and has made me like long for heaven more, that it's a place we should look forward to, because that's where our true home is. The third truth that God has been teaching me is that as much it is to die is to gain, to be at home with Christ is gain. God has also teached me that while I'm living is to live for Christ alone, as Philippians 1:21's mentioned and just to really number my days. So there's a lot of thoughts during this time where I was like, do I wanna, yeah, do I wanna take a break from work? Do I wanna take a break from ministry or church? Do I wanna take a break from people? So there was just so many different thoughts, and while there's definitely nothing wrong with taking a break, I was processing with people like, well, what's the alternative? I'm gonna just sit by myself and think about myself, but instead, God's really strengthened me to continue just to serve and continue to focus on God's calling, and honestly, that's been the strength. You guys have really just strengthened me. So as much as I feel like, oh, I'm serving, you guys are really serving me and really strengthening my faith. So that's prevented me from getting into areas like depression or darkness because God's love and light is shown through you guys. I just wanted to close with what we've been learning in Bible study. I've been trying to memorize these verses, but it hasn't been perfect, but 1 Peter 1, 6-7 is, in this you rejoice, and what we're rejoicing is the fact that we're born again to a living hope through Christ, that even for now, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials so that the tested genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold, which perishes, though it's tested by the fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. So this is something I really want my faith to look like at this time, especially during a time of trial. And for those of you guys, if any of you guys are going through various trials, it might look differently from what I've been going through. Just be encouraged that God is our comforter and he is our living hope, and because of him, because of the truth that we know, that we can live for Christ alone. So have a blessed Passion Week, and thanks for listening. (audience applauding) - Thank you, Denny. If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 23, and I'm gonna start from verse 37, and I'm gonna read chapter 24, verses one, two, and three. And again, as Jenny shared about the sorrow of being separated with her mom, the whole point of this Passion Week is to remind us of the hope that we have of the resurrection of Christ. And so as we celebrate the resurrection on Sunday, we're reminded that even though, and not just Jenny, even my wife lost her mom recently, and I know there's quite a few people in our church just within the last year had funerals, and even now, some of you guys are going through that right now. And the hope that we have in Christ is that Jesus Christ came and died and was resurrected to give us hope that death for Christians is not final, that in the end, we will be reunited with our loved ones because of the blood of Christ. So again, it's a very fitting testimony for us this evening to remind us of what it is that we are celebrating. If you can read with me verse 37, and I'll read, you guys can just follow. Chapter 23, verse 37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her? How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling. Behold, your house is being left to you desolate, for I say to you, from now on, you will not see me until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when his disciples came up to point out to the temple building to him, and he said to them, do you not see all these things? Truly, I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another which will not be torn down. As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately saying, tell us when will these things happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing. Help us to glean from your word the last sermon that Christ gave to his disciples that our life, our mind, our heart may belong to you and to you alone. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. You know, I often, and I think this is true of most pastors, and the older I get, the more prominent that this thought is if I had one last sermon to give, what would I preach? If I had that opportunity, if I knew for sure that this would be the last sermon. And I could think of many things, but at this point I'm not exactly sure. My father, who passed away about 17 years ago, had an opportunity to go back to Korea and to give his last sermon. And we knew it would be his last sermon. The doctor actually told him that if you make this trip that you may not be able to come back. And this is the church that he planted when he was young. And so the church was going through, I think, the 30th or 40th anniversary, and they invited him to come and speak, but he fell so ill that even just walking across the street he would faint because he didn't have enough oxygen. So the doctor told him that if you take this trip you may not be able to come back. And so obviously we're telling him this is too dangerous, you can't go. But I remember my father, because this was a church that he planted in so much of our childhood, and when he was young, ministry was there. That was the beginning of his ministry. And so he said, "Even if I die, I want to go." And so packed up his bags, and I think it was Phillip who basically took him there and had to kind of wheelchair him around. And I didn't know how he was going to preach because he was barely able to stay standing for a while, but somehow he made it, and then he got up on the pulpit. And while he was on the pulpit, you could never tell. And so he gave his last sermon, and sure enough, when he came back, his health failed him. And I think within a year, a year and a half of that, he passed. But he was so determined, and we could not stop him because we knew that this was so important to him, that knowing that he was going back to the church that he planted, and a lot of the people who were there, especially some of the older ones or the ones who invited him, he worked together with, and so some of the closest people that he knew were at that church. And so he wanted to give that message. Well, today, Tuesday, is where Jesus is giving his final discourse to his disciples. So you can imagine, there is not a single thing that Jesus said that was not important. It's inerrant word of God. But imagine if you know that what you've been preparing to do is just a few days away, and that he's been warning them and telling them and preparing them that where I go, you cannot come. The Holy Spirit's gonna come, remind you of everything that I said, but as far as my physical presence, I'm going to head toward the cross, and soon after that, I'm gonna be gone. So you can imagine that the final time that he has with his disciples is well calculated, that everything he says here is knowing that he's going to leave his loved ones, and there is trouble coming for them, and so he needed to make sure that they knew what he wanted them to know before he went. And so that's the Olivet Discourse, where Jesus sits with his disciples. He is a bit removed from the temple, and he's looking down at Jerusalem, saying, "In a few days, that's where I'm headed." And so he tells them, and so the primary thing that he says in Matthew chapter 24, as he gives the Olivet Discourse, the first part of it and the major part of his last part of Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24 is a warning against the trials that's coming. So obviously, this was heavily on Jesus' heart, that after he leaves, that the wolves are going to come and try to deceive them. So Matthew chapter 24, four through six, he says, "See to it that no one misleads you, "for many will come in my name, "saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many. "You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars, "so that you are not frightened, "for those things must take place, "but that is not yet the end." So he tells them, "The primary attack "that you're gonna get are people "who are going to represent me, "are going to lead you astray." And so he's telling them to pay attention, because the primary attack of Antichrist is to come as an angel of light, representing Christ, quoting scripture, saying that they are a servant of Christ, and they will mislead you. So stay sober, Matthew 24, 24 to 26, "For false christs and false prophets will arise "and will show great signs and wonders, "so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect." Meaning that this delusion is going to be so powerful, that even the people who grew up in the church, even the people who went to seminary, even the people who led Bible studies, even the people who may be preaching on a regular basis, that they may lead you astray, and they may be led astray, even the elect, if possible. He said, "Behold, I have told you in advance, "so if they say to you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,' "do not go out, or 'Behold, he is in the inner rooms,' "do not believe them." Again, I'm not picking and choosing certain verses in at the last days. This was his final discourse to his disciples. And you can tell that this is weighing on Jesus' heart, that after he leaves, that this is what they're going to face. They're going to come, they're going to deceive you, they're gonna be quoting me, that it's not going to be me. They're gonna be telling you that this is from me, but it's not going to be me, so pay attention. You know, when Jesus went to the temple, obviously the Pharisees and Sadducees are agitated, so they come to him. "By what authority do you do this? "How dare you come into our house? "Who are you?" Jesus turns the table around, and he tells them, knowing exactly what's in their heart, "Well, I'll answer your question if you answer me." Who is John the Baptist? Was he from God, or was he from earth? They couldn't answer him that question, because they knew it was a loaded question, that if they said that he wasn't from God, he knew that the mobs would turn against him because he was such a popular prophet. But if they say, "Well, he must have been from God," then why were you so against him? So they couldn't answer, and they silenced, Jesus turns the table on them, silenced them, because they were not concerned about truth. They were concerned about their own position. And so Jesus turns around, and not only does he challenge them at the temple, he turns around, and the harshest rebuke that we see in the Bible happens as he is exiting the temple. He gives the eight woes that you probably have heard before, eight woes that he gives to the leaders of Israel. And I'm just gonna highlight just a few of them, because it captures the concerns that he had for the leaders of Israel. Matthew 23, 13, it says, "Bow to you, "scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites, "because you shut off the kingdom of heaven "from people, for you do not enter in yourselves, "nor do you allow those who are entering to go in." You're gonna see that term, scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites, repeated over and over again. As much as he was concerned about Israel, he was primarily concerned about the leaders. And this is not unique to this time. Every time Israel fell away from God, it was the leaders that led them astray. So the warning is, in particular to the scribes and the Pharisees, because they were the spiritual leaders, because they were presenting godliness without true godliness. They were acting like they were holy without truly being holy. They were talking about grace without knowing grace. Matthew 23, 25, "Bow to you, scribes and Pharisees, "you hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup "and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery "and self-indulgence." Now obviously, as a leader in a church, all of these things, first and foremost, is shooting at me. And it's a warning against everyone else who's in leadership. Because the health of the church depends on the leadership's integrity. The health of the church depends on the holiness of the leadership. And the love of Christ of the leadership. And the reason why I share all of this is because we need your prayers. Don't let us get away with hypocrisy. If you see hypocrisy in our lives, don't shrug it underneath the table or underneath the rug. Because the primary rebuke comes to the leadership. That's why it says not many of you should strive to be leaders, because there will be stricter judgment against the leadership. I believe that the church as a whole is in the condition that it is today because of leadership. And so he rebukes them. He tells the disciples, the people who are in the position of leadership, listen to what they say, but do not do what they do. Matthew 23, 27, 28, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, "hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs, "which on the outside appear beautiful, "but inside they are full of dead men's bones "and all uncleanness." So you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Matthew 23, 12, "Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, "and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted." The primary hypocrisy of leadership was that they wanted to be leaders. They wanted to be seen. They wanted the honor. They wanted to be ahead and to be respected. They were more concerned about their reputation than they were about righteousness and truth of the word of God. And so as Jesus looks at Jerusalem, first and foremost, what he is frustrated with is the leadership of Israel. That though they stand in a place to represent the holy God, it's because of the leadership that people were going astray. So he warns his disciples, first and foremost, watch out. It is not safe for us to quote leaders. It is not safe for us to gain our theology from leadership. That I follow this guy, I follow that guy. And we're not saying that we shouldn't honor men that we respect, but they are not the heralder of truth. The word of God is. We need to be in the habit of quoting scripture. We need to be in the habit of having our confidence coming from the word of God that we're wrestling with. Not simply because some man that we respect has quoted this because that's exactly the beginning of the fall. If we put our confidence in men, no matter who they are, no matter what their track record may be. No man is safe from hypocrisy. No man should be standing in the place where only Christ should stand. And so he tells his disciples to be careful. But along with that, he tells them, and he warns them to prepare them for the tribulations that are coming. To give them hope in the midst of tribulation. He's telling them that after I leave, wolves are going to come, and hard time is gonna come your way. It's gonna come to them directly as soon as he leaves, but there's also going to be the hardship that's going to come right before he comes. So he says in Matthew 24, 29, 31, but immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken, and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. Now how is that an encouragement? When he says persecution, pestilence, war is coming, it's an encouragement because he says when you see that happening, you know Christ is near. Just like when suffering comes, nothing causes us to desire Christ more than when we are in the midst of suffering. When the world goes into haywire, and it is out of whack, and the world is trying to figure out where's the answer to this, it's a reminder to us that Christ is near. When we are mourning, and we are hurting, and we are crying, and we are scared, he said remember, Christ is near. That's what he was trying to remind them, that you're gonna experience this, they're gonna hate you because of me. They might wanna crucify you because of me, but know that I am near, I am coming. First Thessalonians 5, 9 through 11, for God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might live with him. Therefore encourage one another, and build one another just as you are doing. Remind each other in times of suffering. This is the reason why this week is so important to us. You know we tend to suffer alone at home, and then we tend to come to church, and party, and rejoice, and laugh together. But there's not a single person in here, maybe even this week, but for sure this year, for sure in the last couple years, I know that there's not a single person in this room who has not wept privately because of some sort of pain. You may have lost somebody, may have been rejected, had relational problems, maybe with children, whatever it may be, living in this fallen world, we all experience some sort of suffering, some sort of hardship, every single one of us. Jesus is reminding his disciples, though he is talking about the specific tribulation, it's a reminder to us when suffering comes, that he is near. This is the exact reason why he came, to wipe away our tears, to remind us that because of what Christ has done, that he went to prepare a place for us, that all the crying, and there may be more crying, and more weeping, and more sorrow ahead of us, but all of that in the midst of all the pain, remember Jesus' words, I am coming, I am coming. Third and finally, he teaches them about a second coming so that we may live whatever time that we have left here in soberness. He gives a parable of the virgins, five of them who weren't prepared, living their life like everybody else, and the other five who had the oil ready, but when the bridegroom came, the five were ready, and so they came in, and then the five others did not. And then he gives a parable of the five talents, the five, and the two, and the one, where they were diligent in using, being ready for the master to come so that they can present what they have done, and warned them not to be like that one talent, and he just buries it and say, well, I'll just wait until he comes. And so he tells them, because he is coming, live as if he is coming. Don't live like you're gonna be here forever, 'cause we're not. Don't live here and act, and make decisions, and invest, and pursue, like you're gonna be here forever, 'cause you're not, you know you're not. But Jesus' last teaching to his disciples is to remind them, I am coming. It may not be tomorrow, it may not be the next day, but I am coming. And when he comes, to be prepared. First John 3, two to three, it says, beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared, but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is, and everyone who thus hopes in him puts himself as he is pure. You know, as Jenny was sharing, and I think it was very appropriate, now she said that heaven didn't seem that real. It's not because she didn't believe it. It's not because she looked at it and said, I don't believe heaven, but it just didn't seem real until she suffered the loss of her mom. And so the blessing of the sorrow of being separated from a loved one is a reminder to us to be sober that he is coming, that heaven is real, that one day we will be reunited, not only with our loved ones, but with Christ himself. And so to live to prepare, as if we only have one more year. Talk to your friends as if that may be your last time you talk to them. You don't know. This may be the last Easter that you may have an opportunity to share with a non-Christian in your life. Approach it like it may be, not thinking, maybe I have another 20, maybe I can ask another 30 years from now, maybe 50 years from now. You never know. I remember, and I've shared this story before, but in the years ago, there was a young guy who came to church and he fell away from faith all throughout college. And he just graduated UC San Diego, and then he was just starting to show interest again in Christianity. But he wasn't just interested in Christianity, he was kind of poking at Christianity, Buddhism. But his heart was starting to move toward Christianity, so he showed up to church, and again, this is a very early part of our church, and he said, "Pastor Peter, can I meet with you "when I come back next week?" 'Cause I'm planning to come back, 'cause I have a lot of questions to ask you. And so I was so excited that this guy, he's returning back to faith, and I had plans and cleared my schedule after Sunday to meet with him on a regular basis, and I show up the next Sunday and he's not there. I said, "Oh, he seems so excited, I wonder what happened." And so I contacted his friend to see what happened and found his friend crying, and I asked, "So what happened?" And he said he went out to party the night before on Saturday. And him and his younger brother went clubbing and got drunk, and on the way back home, he didn't wear his seatbelt, and literally, the exit that he was supposed to go off to go to his house, he didn't make the turn that he was supposed to make, and the car flipped over, and because he wasn't wearing his seatbelt, he flew out of the car. His younger brother went home, didn't find his brother there, so after a couple hours, he came back looking for him, found his brother's car flipped over on the side of the road, and his brother another 100 yards from there, and he passed away. And so they were telling me that's why he couldn't make it that Sunday. And he was just starting his life, 23-year-old, 22-year-old young man. And I remember going to his funeral and listening to his father give the eulogy. And you know what his father said at his eulogy? And his father wasn't a Christian. And at the eulogy, his father said, "Don't be stupid like my son." That was his eulogy. He looked at his son's friends. "Don't live your life like an idiot like my son. "Don't do something stupid like my son." That's all he said, and he sat down. And I remember thinking, just gut-wrenching. We truly don't know how long we have. And I don't say this to scare you, but that's the reality. Our life is fragile. We don't know how long we're gonna be here. We don't know, the loved ones that surround us, how long they're gonna be here. I can tell you stories after stories of people that you would have never thought just lie down to take a nap and never woke up. We don't know. But the danger that we have is, especially when we're young, we have a tendency to think that all our plans are gonna come true. And we get shocked when it doesn't. But you live long enough, and life teaches you this life is short. Whether we have one year or 50 years, Jesus is reminding his disciples, "I'm coming. "Live like I'm coming. "Don't just say it with your mouth. "Live like I'm coming." Colossians 3, 4, 1 through 4, let me finish with this. If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. As we walk with Christ in the last day of his life, and obviously, you guys have made it a priority this week to come and walk along with Christ in each day. Sometimes the way we practice our faith doesn't seem real. The gravity of what we sing about, the gravity of what we preach, the gravity of sin and hell is taken too lightly. All of us. Don't live in such a way that if we died tomorrow, that we would regret it. That we would all, every single one of us, we have a tendency to be distracted. And part of the reason why we're making a big deal of this week, it's not just this week, but especially this week, that at least, at least this week, that we would take some time to understand the gravity of what Christ has done. So that our response in view of this mercy will be a reasonable response. To what he has done. That our worship would be reasonable. That our decisions may be reasonable. That our value may be reasonable. Our pursuits may be reasonable. Our fellowship may be reasonable. That our life may be lived in reasonable response to the gravity of what he has done for us. Let's pray. (pastor sighing) Let's take some time to reflect on Jesus' words this last week. On Pastor Peter's encouragement on Sunday, Pastor Mark's encouragement yesterday, and Jesus' last words of encouragement and warning. Take some time to understand the gravity of what he has done, and what he will do on Friday. That God will bring true revival. That our faith may be strengthened as we come before the Lord. Let's take some time to pray.

Father, as we remember each day of the agonizing walk of Christ in these last days, Lord, we pray for revival. Lord, I confess we have become so comfortable, Lord, even to pray for revival. The fear, Lord God, comes upon me, not knowing what You will do to bring this revival, not wanting You to examine every part of my life. Lord, as You warned us to remember the height from which we have fallen, to repent and do the things that we did at first, Lord, we're gathered here, Father God, because we are weak, because without Your Spirit's conviction and help and courage and faith, we can't just by our sheer will bring revival in our own hearts, to soften hardened hearts. I pray that each night we come and meditate and cry out to You, help us, Lord God, to have a greater vision of who Jesus is, that the reality, Lord God, of Your second coming would be more and more real to us, so that we would not place our hope here, we would not place our hope in our marriages, in our children, in our future, our jobs, our bank account, but we would live, Lord God, knowing that all this one day will disappear and all that will remain, Lord God, are the things that You have ordained. I pray that You would help us to see these things more clearly through this week, that as Christ suffers on the cross, that we would not be indifferent, that we would cry out, that we would fellowship in His pain, that we would walk in His shoes, and to know that He did all of that for me. I pray that that reality would become real this week. So we pray, Father God, You would help us, revive us, renew us. May Christ's name and His name alone be adored this week. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. nothing at all.</p></div></body></html>
