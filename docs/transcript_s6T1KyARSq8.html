And just to encourage you, there are many people, specifically in our lives, who need to hear the gospel. I encourage you to think about them specifically as you pray, as we come before our God, hoping and praying that the Spirit will work in the hearts of our friends, our loved ones. So let's continue to pray.

And the reason why this is a little bit shorter, but there's so much involved in just the priority of worship corporately, but also of us personally, we recognize that we can kind of throw around that word "worship" constantly, but at the end, when we think of what worship is, and what we're doing when we come to corporately worship God together, it's simply an extension of what we're called to do minute to minute in our lives. So we don't enter, we don't really enter into times of worship, we do enter into times of corporate worship. Corporate worship isn't a time just for personal worship, it's where we come together and remember the God that we serve together. It's an encouragement that happens. So for that to happen then, personal worship needs to first be happening. My question to you tonight is, has that been happening in your life? How much do we compartmentalize our lives to keep certain things alive and vibrant only when we're able to, you know, we're in front of the word or when we're praying. But when we consider things like whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Is the whole of your life worship? Is the whole of our lives here worship? Have we been, if priority is even the right word, prioritizing that? And maybe it's not so much a need for us to prioritize as it is that when we are genuinely, in spirit and in truth, worshiping God, that there is going to be a weightiness and a certain preciousness to our worship. So continue to think through, are we posturing? Are we just playing a role and a part? Even as we're praying tonight, ask yourself, what am I doing? Are these real words? When we're singing these songs, are those real words of praise and worship towards God? Is it real adoration towards God? Is that what we're doing here tonight? Are we actually adoring God together? Are we loving God more? Is our hearts growing in passion for the Lord? Are we actually lifting Him up? Let's guard that and pray for that, that our church would be a church that does that personally and corporately, so that when we do come together to worship together, nights like this, when we worship together on Sundays, that those would be such sweet times that it doesn't need to be something I have to do as a Christian or something I need to kind of remember I'm supposed to prioritize, but that it becomes a sweet time, a time we look forward to, the best time in our weeks, because we get to worship together as a church. Let's then pray for that. Pray that the nights before we would sleep on time, because we're prioritizing that. We want that to be that kind of time for us. Pray that we come on time because we want to prioritize that. Pray that our church, that this room would be filled with people who pray before the service even begins. Pray that our church can be a church that grows steadily in this and that we're not okay with just continuing the way we have been, but that we're daily growing, even with the encouragement that there has been for us. Pray also for the protection of the pulpit, for the primacy of God's Word, that this pulpit would be guarded by God and that you can pray even for the people who preach, for the leadership of the church, for the elders. Would you pray that God's Word wouldn't be tainted by the sinful lips of men. And then the praise team is going to be singing another song. That can be a cue for you, although you can continue to pray for this to move on to upcoming events. There's a lot to pray for. There's an upcoming Bible study as we go through those four books, a Bible lab that Pastor Mark will be leading. There's going to be the family ministry community groups that are coming up. The men's ministry fellowship is going to be directed specifically on the topic of purity. You can pray 20 minutes just for that. Pray for the women's ministry time and the sweet time of fellowship there. I believe the women's ministries also, many of them are going to be going through the book Don't Waste Your Life. A lot to pray for there. A lot of us are. Pray for the current membership class. There are over 60 people signed up for the current membership class. That's a little crazy. Pray. We need to pray. As crazy as that might be, we need to pray more for those things and pray for all the participants as they learn and grow. Pray for the FAM 245 workshop. And then there are three retreats, the youth retreat. Pastor Charlie's going to be preaching on joy in Christ. Pastor Simon for the BAM on fear of God. Pastor Ian later on in college on the topic of proclaim the name. There are many more things that we could be praying for. I did want to ask us to pray also specifically if we can for Khan and Claire. I know our family ministry has been praying and fasting for them. But Claire who has late stage aggressive, she has a thymus cancer and she has a little one at home. Pray for Khan as this is just such a difficult time for them and they need our encouragement and prayer. Pray also please for Janice and Jen. Janice's parents, both of them are together going through chemotherapy at the same time. Pray for healing, pray for strength, pray for faith for these church members of ours. And I only named two. There's so many more that you know of. But if we all pray together, we can cover all of these things in prayer. So let's take the next 15 to 20 minutes again. And please, I know there are going to be times where your words fail and you lose concentration. But battle for this, fight for soberness. In the midst of these prayer requests, pray again that God would help you through this and lean in closer again to God. When the songs come out, sing together and when they close, pray again. And let this be a time where we can be intimate with the Lord together.                                                                                                                                                   ♪ Father of kindness, you have poured out grace ♪ ♪ You brought me out of darkness ♪ ♪ You have filled me with peace ♪ ♪ Giver of mercy, you're my help in times of need ♪ ♪ Lord, I can't help but sing ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Faithful forever you will be ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪  ♪ Beautiful Savior ♪ ♪ Beautiful Savior, you have brought me near ♪ ♪ You pulled me from the ashes ♪ ♪ You have broken every curse ♪ ♪ Blessed Redeemer, you have set this captive for me ♪ ♪ Lord, I can't help but sing ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Faithful forever you will be ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ All your promises, Lord ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Faithful forever you will be ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Yes, you are, Lord ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪  ♪ I will rest ♪ ♪ I will rest ♪ ♪ In your promises ♪ ♪ My confidence ♪ ♪ Is your faithfulness ♪ ♪ I will rest ♪ ♪ In your promises ♪ ♪ My confidence ♪ ♪ Is your faithfulness ♪ ♪ I will rest ♪ ♪ In your promises ♪ ♪ My confidence ♪ ♪ Is your faithfulness ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Faithful forever you will be ♪ ♪ Faithful you are ♪ ♪ Yes, you are, Lord ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ ♪ All your promises ♪ ♪ All your promises are yes and amen ♪ - Let's go ahead and stand for our closing song.   ♪ Your will be done, my God and Father ♪ ♪ As in heaven, so on earth ♪ ♪ My heart is drawn to self-exalting ♪ ♪ Help me seek your kingdom first ♪ ♪ As Jesus walked, so I shall walk ♪ ♪ Held by your same unchanging love ♪ ♪ Be still my soul, oh lift your voice and pray ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪  ♪ How in that garden he persisted ♪ ♪ I may never fully know ♪ ♪ The fearful weight of true obedience ♪ ♪ It was held by him alone ♪ ♪ What wondrous faith to bear that cross ♪ ♪ To bear my sin ♪ ♪ What wondrous love, my hope was sure ♪ ♪ When there my savior prayed ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪  ♪ When I am lost, when I am broken ♪ ♪ In the night of fear and doubt ♪ ♪ Still I will trust in my good father ♪ ♪ Yes, to one great king I bow ♪ ♪ As Jesus rose, so I will rise ♪ ♪ And ransom glory at the throne ♪ ♪ My heart restored with all your saints I sing ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪  ♪ As we go forth, our God and Father ♪ ♪ Lead us daily in the fight ♪ ♪ That all the world might see your glory ♪ ♪ And your name be lifted high ♪ ♪ And in this name we overcome ♪ ♪ For you shall see us safely home ♪ ♪ Now as your church, we lift our voice and pray ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪ ♪ And in this name we overcome ♪ ♪ For you shall see us safely home ♪ ♪ Now as your church, we lift our voice and pray ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪ ♪ Father, not my will, but yours be done ♪ - Let's pray. Heavenly Father, God at the end of prayer, we know that it does not just close the book for us to go and live our lives. Father, this is not only our song, but our desire for the whole of our lives. God, not our will, but yours be done. Father, that prayer would be perpetual in us. God, that we would pray without ceasing. God, that our desire would consistently and constantly be yours. And Lord, that we would come as grateful people filled with such great gratitude for what you've done for us. God, fill us with peace tonight. Fill us, God, with more and more contentment and satisfaction in Christ and only in him. And in those things that might distract us and take our eyes away, I pray, Father, that there would be a boldness and a conviction inside of us to be able to live our lives the way we desire to. That we would not be following after the lusts of our flesh. But God, that our desire, Father, would be of the Spirit. That we would walk in the Spirit. That we would pursue you. That we would chase after you and the things of your kingdom. Help us, Lord, not to limp by in this life, but to be filled with victory, with power, with the Spirit. God, that you would consume the whole of us. That the world might see the light of the gospel in us. That this church, Lord, would be filled with strength that can only come as we abide in a living God. So, Lord, thank you that we can do this together. And I pray, Father, for all of us, even as we go our separate ways, Lord, that our fellowship would be strong. That our lives would be united. That our desire would be the same. Father, not our will, but yours be done. So thank you, God, for this time of prayer that we're able to very specifically engage in together over the last hour and a half. I pray, God, for more of it. Thank you so much for listening to us tonight. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Well, that's it for the night. We can just go ahead and make our way out. Go ahead and fellowship. You can also spend more time in prayer. I know we get used to kind of praying at the end, breaking off. But you guys can do that a little bit more organically, if you'd like, as well. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪</p></div></body></html>
