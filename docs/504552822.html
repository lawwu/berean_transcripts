going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=10s">00:00:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to cover again just one verse.</span></div><div

14</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=31s">00:00:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">chapters, about 13 chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span

summarizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=183s">00:03:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all of his experience and says, "The chief end of man

that Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=195s">00:03:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">taught at the end, he gave that commission to the church, "Go make disciples of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=200s">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">nations, baptizing them in

other things, but the reason why we call that the Great Commission is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=207s">00:03:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the last commandment that he left the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=212s">00:03:32.220</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=224s">00:03:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember, you know, when you're young, your dad says things just kind of like, "Yeah,</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=231s">00:03:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But years later, you think back and it makes so much sense and there's so much wisdom behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=236s">00:03:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=237s">00:03:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that my dad said that really stuck with me, he said, "How you leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=241s">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something is much more important than how you came."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=243s">00:04:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Much more important because how you leave is what they will remember

href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=251s">00:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it's so true, there's so much wisdom behind that, that we start with a bang and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=256s">00:04:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">then we end with the fizzle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=258s">00:04:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically, that's how human relationships are, you know, like we start with excitement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=263s">00:04:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it just kind of fizzles out and then we have experience after experience of bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=268s">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=270s">00:04:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's much more important how we end than how we started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=278s">00:04:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking about in this one verse, at the end of his life, he's blessing his children</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=283s">00:04:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so that God's covenant blessing will be passed on.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=292s">00:04:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What was most important to him is at the tail end, he knows he's going to die and he wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/504552822#t=296s">00:04:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that his children are
