the justification of Christ, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=121s">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">recently we made a

on, it focuses on the application of what it means to be a Christian, not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=140s">00:02:20.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=144s">00:02:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for what he has done and all that is important and it is foundational."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=148s">00:02:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But based on that foundation, what do we do as Christians?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=150s">00:02:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we apply this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=152s">00:02:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about how chapter 12 verse 1 says, "To offer your whole bodies, not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=157s">00:02:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a portion, but everything that we are ought to be offered up as a living sacrifice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=162s">00:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just a weekend, not just a portion, but all of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=166s">00:02:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he talked about how in verse 3 to verse 8, that he's given us different gifts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=172s">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to carry this out, to practice this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=174s">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though not everything about application is about love, the scripture makes it absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=182s">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">crystal clear that the greatest of the commandments is to love God and to love your neighbor as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=187s">00:03:07.320</a></span> | <span

by loving your neighbor as yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=193s">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though he may not be expressly saying that you ought to love in perseverance, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=198s">00:03:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ought to love in tribulation, that in application, the greatest application of perseverance would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=204s">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be in practicing love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=206s">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The greatest application in using our gifts is to love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=210s">00:03:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though I may not be mentioning the word love throughout every one of these commands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=215s">00:03:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope that you understand that that is what's assumed in scripture, that all of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=219s">00:03:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that God has commanded us to do is ultimately to practice the love that Christ practiced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=223s">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on us.</span></div><div

gone by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=230s">00:03:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but we've spent about 80 to 90 sermons just talking about justification of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=234s">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we go to chapter 12, we're talking about application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/256504702#t=239s">00:03:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But Philemon, I think, is a great
