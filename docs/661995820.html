from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=127">00:02:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

right things are passing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=160">00:02:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">through, and that's why they named January January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=165">00:02:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Appropriately, obviously, because we're making that

sure how many of you know the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=199">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">context in which he said this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=202">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Socrates actually was executed because of his influence on the youth of his generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=208">00:03:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was beginning to question some of the state's mandates of what gods that they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=213">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to worship, what gods they're not supposed to worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=216">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Socrates in no way was a Christian, but he was beginning to influence the youth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=221">00:03:41.920</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=225">00:03:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">his own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=226">00:03:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they brought him into court basically saying that if you don't stop teaching these</span></div><div

executed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=235">00:03:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's in that context that Socrates stood up and said, "A life that is unexamined is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=241">00:04:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not worth living."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=242">00:04:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, I'd rather die than to just give in and just you telling me to think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=247">00:04:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">way I'm supposed to think and do whatever I'm told to do, it's not worth living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=252">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the context in which Socrates says this term, "An unexamined life is not worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=257">00:04:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">living."</span></div><div

change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=267">00:04:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some things that we're going through in the new

looking for Nordstrom, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=285">00:04:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=286">00:04:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing you do when you get out of your parking lot and you get to, before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=290">00:04:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">start walking, you need to find out where Nordstrom

then once you find out where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=298">00:04:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it is, there's a second thing that you

href="https://www.vimeo.com/661995820&t=368">00:06:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so his life goal was to know Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
