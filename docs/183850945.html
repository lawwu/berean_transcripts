Just say older group, younger group, no preference, married, not married. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=113s">00:01:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">those of you guys who are going to be alternating between husband and wife, say alternating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=117s">00:01:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">husband and wife.

And then there's some of you who are not able to come consistently and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=146s">00:02:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you don't have a preference or you don't want to be in a small group.

We'll have a table for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=163s">00:02:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that as well. Okay. So in a, in a large group like this, we have all different needs. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=169s">00:02:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just make sure whatever your needs are or desire preference, put it on there and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=175s">00:02:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to assign the small group.

So as you're coming in, you'll be able to see which table</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=183s">00:03:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are and we'll Mark each table by number. So when you come in, you'll know exactly where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=188s">00:03:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to go next week.

So we don't put you guys all in one group. So we don't want one group with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=199s">00:03:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like one week, six people in the next group. Next week we have one person in there. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=207s">00:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have every intention of being consistent every single week for the next 12 weeks, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=211s">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have to put anything. But if, if you know you're not going to be consistent, please</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=215s">00:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Mark that on there as well. We do not have a coed group. Okay. So if that's your preference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=222s">00:03:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't put it on there. Okay.

Um, but again, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=229s">00:03:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">men and women who are alternating because of husband and wife situation with the children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=235s">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We are still trying to figure out the, the childcare.

So class outline and teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=339s">00:05:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">outline. Okay. So if you didn't get one, you should go to the back and it's on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=347s">00:05:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, every day when you're coming in, you should pick up.

The structure of the class, if you look at it from the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=387s">00:06:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Breean's BCC2, September 21.

Do your best to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=393s">00:06:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">try to come on time at seven o'clock. Okay. Usually we start out trying to get close to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=399s">00:06:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">seven o'clock and then as each week goes by, it kind of gets looser and 710, 715. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=405s">00:06:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end, it's like 720. We don't want to do that because that's 20 minutes wasted for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=410s">00:06:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody who came at seven o'clock.

So please, please, please, if you're in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=415s">00:06:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">habit of grabbing dinner at 650, you know what I mean? You're, you're goofing around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=420s">00:07:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever. And then 650, that we have 15 minutes and you're just kind of casual about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=424s">00:07:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">time.

I know some of you guys coming off of work late and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=429s">00:07:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't help that, but if that's not the case and you just kind of are really bad with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=434s">00:07:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">time and I just want to give you some life encouragement. If that's a practice that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=438s">00:07:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have that'll ruin your life at some point in your life, right? At some point, somebody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=442s">00:07:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to say, this guy's not reliable. So if that's a practice that you have, or if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=446s">00:07:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a practice just at church, that's not, that's not good either. Right? If you're prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=451s">00:07:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at work and prompt at appointments, but not prompt at church, that's a, that's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=457s">00:07:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bad heart. Right? So do your best to try to come on time. And this also relates to church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=463s">00:07:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">on Sunday. Okay. Again, it's church on Sunday and we have to periodically remind you the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=468s">00:07:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">church starts at nine and 11. So if you're in a habit of missing 10 minutes of church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=473s">00:07:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">every single week, that adds up at the end of the year, you missed half the church according</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=479s">00:07:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to my math. All right. So I want to encourage you guys, you know, if you can be prompt as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=485s">00:08:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">much as you can. So we're going to try to do, try to start closest to seven o'clock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=489s">00:08:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as possible. So if you look at the timeline, seven o'clock to seven 15 is going to be worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=495s">00:08:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, about 15 minutes. And then after that, there's going to be a, we'll study, um, every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=504s">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">week there's going to be a memory verse. And we're going to ask you guys to just take some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=507s">00:08:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time to meditate on that. Those memory verses are related to the teaching topic of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=512s">00:08:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">day. Okay. So if you look at it, look at the bottom, look at the bottom and you know how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=521s">00:08:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it says Leviticus one, Leviticus 10, one through 11, the week, 61 through 16, all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=527s">00:08:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">verses are related to the topic that pastor Mark is going to be teaching next week. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=533s">00:08:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we were asking you to do is each week's quiet time, our passages that are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=539s">00:08:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">be, again, the topics are going to be covered for that week. So again, the quiet time, those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=546s">00:09:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are quiet time passages that we're asking you to take the five days to do. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=550s">00:09:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the one verse to memorize. So when you first come in here in your small groups, we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=554s">00:09:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask you guys to take some time to keep each other accountable, right? And memorize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=558s">00:09:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">those verses. Okay. And do your best so that you'll kind of have a system in your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=564s">00:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In the, in the next 12 weeks, you'll have about 11 verses that you have memorized and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=568s">00:09:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll correlate with the topic that we are teaching that day. Okay. So that's for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=574s">00:09:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">week again, if, if you come and ask me where the quiet time passages, it means you weren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=579s">00:09:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">paying attention right now. All right. So it's in the bottom of the orientation sheet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=584s">00:09:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Leviticus it, um, those five verses plus the memory verse in the very bottom of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=589s">00:09:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the page. Most of you guys, I'm going to be adding on electronic copy for whatever reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=596s">00:09:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If your email is not accurate, um, it's not going to go to you or your emails outdated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=601s">00:10:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it doesn't come to you and you wanted one, you're going to have to email separately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=604s">00:10:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">directly to me or pastor Mark. And we'll try to add you to that. Otherwise, um, we're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=610s">00:10:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be adding everybody to the email list. We're going to also, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=613s">00:10:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have a hard copy, but we're also going to be sending out emails as well. Okay. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=620s">00:10:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Any questions about that? So after that, we'll have time of worship after worship, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=624s">00:10:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be teaching for about 30, 40 minutes. And then after that, there's going to be again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=628s">00:10:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">reflection worship. So we're going to have either probably about one song in the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=632s">00:10:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">one or two songs, and then one or two songs at the end. And then that'll lead you to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=637s">00:10:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time of small group and small group will be about eight, 10 to about nine, 10. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=641s">00:10:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to have snacks afterwards. Okay. All right. So that's the format. So those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=646s">00:10:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of you who are familiar with Wednesday Bible study, it's very, it's pretty much what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=650s">00:10:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">did before. But for those of you who are new, that's the format that we're going to be following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=655s">00:10:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Okay. Elements of the class each week, we will have devotional passages again. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=661s">00:11:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we already went over that. And then there will be discussion questions at the end that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=666s">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to ask you guys to take some time to discuss. Okay. So next week, when you come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=675s">00:11:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in again, we're going to be pushing you to small groups. So look for that when you come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=679s">00:11:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in. So we'll try to minimize as much time as possible next week. Again, up to next week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=684s">00:11:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be a little bit more hectic in the small groups because we're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=686s">00:11:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">get organized. But after that, we'll kind of be in a system. This is a 12 week class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=691s">00:11:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That'll take us to December, I think 14th. We have one week off during Thanksgiving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=697s">00:11:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, it'll be straight 12 weeks. Okay. And then after that, we're going to be taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=703s">00:11:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Christmas and New Year's break, and then we'll come back for another class afterwards. Let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=707s">00:11:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">me give you a brief synopsis of why we're doing this for this particular class. BCC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=714s">00:11:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">2 is something that we've actually been discussing in leadership for many, many years. For the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=719s">00:11:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">last maybe about five, six years plus, we've been discussing this because as our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=724s">00:12:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">started growing to a certain size, we started realizing that the core values of the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=730s">00:12:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">weren't translating into the rest of the church as organically as it used to. Before, we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=737s">00:12:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have small groups, and during small groups, we would read certain books, certain fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=741s">00:12:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">books about God's attributes, about the essence of what it means to be saved, gospel according</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=747s">00:12:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to Jesus, and then the teachings about the church. What is the book's name? Master's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=758s">00:12:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Plan for the Church. Sorry. So those are three books that every single member of the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=762s">00:12:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">read multiple times because those three things established a fundamental foundation upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=768s">00:12:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which we build everything else at church. So if you have a wrong view of God or skewed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=772s">00:12:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">view of God or incomplete view of God, then you're not going to really understand why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=777s">00:12:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we are a church that does what we do and why we do that. Another book that we read is Gospel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=783s">00:13:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">According to Jesus. If your understanding of the gospel or your salvation is superficial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=788s">00:13:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">again, is incomplete, then again, a lot of things that we do in the church is not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=792s">00:13:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to make a lot of sense to you. And then the third is what is God's intent for the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=797s">00:13:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for the local church, and how did God establish it? What are the essence of the local church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=802s">00:13:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and what we believe in it that the Bible teaches? And that kind of gives you the framework behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=807s">00:13:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that we do at church. How do we how we do discipleship? Why we do teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=811s">00:13:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this way? Why is the church organized this way? Right? And then when our church was smaller,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=816s">00:13:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">when we were having small groups, basically, if you were at the church for more than five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=820s">00:13:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">months to six months, you would have already kind of understood, oh, this is what our church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=825s">00:13:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is about. But as our church started growing, we realized that that wasn't happening organically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=829s">00:13:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then these fundamental books were not being read. Okay. I'm assuming more than half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=834s">00:13:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of you in this room probably have not read any of those three books. There was a time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=838s">00:13:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in our church, I think up to about 200, where almost 100% of the church read that and probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=844s">00:14:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">read that multiple times. Okay. The reason it's not that those three books are the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=849s">00:14:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">books that deal with that subject, but the subjects that those three books deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=854s">00:14:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are foundational to the church. So again, if you either don't understand it, or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=859s">00:14:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">even you don't agree with it, right after you've read it and said, I don't know if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=863s">00:14:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">agree with this, then you're going to have a hard time with a lot of things that we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=866s">00:14:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at church because our teaching and everything else we do is founded upon that. Right. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=871s">00:14:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for so many years, we've been wrestling with, well, how are we going to reintroduce the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=877s">00:14:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">church? And then we've been talking about having BCC too, but we just didn't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=881s">00:14:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">manpower, you know, again, I'm not going to get into that part of it, but we didn't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=887s">00:14:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to overload the pastors and the people who are already serving and then add another thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=891s">00:14:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that we had to do. So we thought that, you know what, why don't we take the time that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=895s">00:14:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we have on Wednesday and just do it with the whole church. And then the class that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=900s">00:15:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">having now is going to be a class that we're going to continue to develop, you know, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=905s">00:15:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">change, but develop. And it's going to be an ongoing class. So the future members that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=909s">00:15:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">come to our church, we're going to have BCC one. And then we're going to have at some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=912s">00:15:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">point after they become members, ask them to take this class. Right. So this is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=918s">00:15:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of like a large picture discipleship. We want everybody at the church to come to the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=922s">00:15:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">page. And so if you have a lot of questions, if there are discussions happening in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=926s">00:15:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">small groups where you need help we want to do our best to kind of shepherd you in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=931s">00:15:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">way to we'll come over to the table, answer some of the questions, because like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=937s">00:15:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that we're teaching at church, obviously we're doing it. It's important because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=940s">00:15:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it's coming out of the scripture. But if fundamentally you don't get something or you don't agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=945s">00:15:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with something or you need explanation of why this is so important, we really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=950s">00:15:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">try to help you to do that. Because like I said, if these foundations are not there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=955s">00:15:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what you are learning on Sunday and weekday Bible study, you're not going to have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=958s">00:15:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">container to hold these things. Right. You're going to have questions and it's never going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=963s">00:16:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to be answered because you don't understand why we do what we do. Okay. So that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=967s">00:16:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why we have BCC two. So those of you who've been at our church for a long time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=972s">00:16:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning if you've been here six, seven years or longer, a lot of the stuff that we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=976s">00:16:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to be talking about is review. And I think it's beneficial for you too, because we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=982s">00:16:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to bring the church back to the backbone of our church. The first 10 years of our church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=988s">00:16:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this was our church, right? This is what we built on. This is what was taught. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=992s">00:16:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what was repeated. And every member of the church knew exactly why we did what we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=998s">00:16:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, as our church is getting, getting larger, we want to make sure that we bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1001s">00:16:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">our church back to that. Right. So again, even though it is review, I think it's worthwhile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1007s">00:16:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to try to get the church back. So our hope is that in the future, if somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1012s">00:16:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">new comes to church and they ask, why did the church do this? And why does the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1015s">00:16:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do that? How come evangelism is done this way? That every member in the church who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1019s">00:16:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">been here for a while, we'll be able to explain to them, right? Because you, you yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1024s">00:17:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what's going on. All right. So that's what's going on. That's the reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1029s">00:17:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">behind our BCC two class. After this session, it will probably offered either on Thursday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1035s">00:17:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or even on Sunday, we may have a Sunday afternoon, BCC two class, and we may have various people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1040s">00:17:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">teaching that. Okay. Um, if you happen to miss this, it is going to be recorded. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1047s">00:17:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's, I think there's one group in particular that's meeting out in Hacienda and they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1053s">00:17:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a group of 10 or 12 that that's meeting. And, um, if you, if you are, if you happen to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1059s">00:17:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">way out there and you cannot make it here, um, the recordings are going to be recorded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1064s">00:17:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and uploaded sometime this week. So I think on Thursday or Friday, it's going to be uploaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1071s">00:17:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're going to be a week behind us. So if you say, you know what, I'm coming from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1075s">00:17:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">LA and it's too far and we can't make it. And if you, if you create a small group over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1079s">00:17:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there that can watch the video, uh, we encourage you to do the same thing and we'll get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1084s">00:18:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">materials out to you and the recordings will be there so you can follow one week after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1088s">00:18:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we're done. Okay. All right. Any questions about that so far? Okay, good. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1096s">00:18:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the description of the course, I'm not going to go through all of it. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1100s">00:18:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outline of the course is very similar to BCC class. Those of you who've taken BCC, I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1106s">00:18:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">probably about 70, 80% of this, this room has probably taken the class. When we first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1112s">00:18:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">developed BCC, um, our pre-membership class is 10 week course. First week is an introduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1118s">00:18:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Last week is review. And then the eight courses that eight classes that we have are divided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1122s">00:18:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">into two visions. The first vision is God-centered worship, not man-centered. So the two days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1128s">00:18:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of class, we go over God's attributes, God, Christ, Holy Spirit. Right? And then as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1134s">00:18:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do that, we go, we introduce, um, our church philosophy, why we do this, and we introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1139s">00:18:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">our church as we're talking about that. The second two weeks is, is the vision of, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1143s">00:19:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know, to equip every Saint with God's inerrant word and why inerrancy and the word of God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1148s">00:19:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is so important and how that affects what we do in our church, right? Ministry philosophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1154s">00:19:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Third is the building a local church based on love and accountability and how that affects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1158s">00:19:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the church, right? And then fourth is reaching the lost locally and globally. So each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1164s">00:19:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the eight weeks that we have, two weeks dedicated to each vision and each of those two weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1169s">00:19:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we talk about the vision of the church. Now, so the topic that we have is similar, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1175s">00:19:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to go a bit further than what we're able to do on those eight weeks. Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1180s">00:19:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice here, the outline is similar, but we spend a little bit more time on some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1185s">00:19:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">subjects than we do the other. So the first three is going to be, again, God-centered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1190s">00:19:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">worship, high view of God. And we're going to get into that today and I'm going to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1194s">00:19:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it and pastor. So pastor Mark and I are going to be alternating teaching. So I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1198s">00:19:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do one and the next week he's going to do his part and I'm going to do, I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1202s">00:20:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">do the week after that. When he leads, I'm going to be, I'm going to be leading worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1207s">00:20:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I'm teaching, he's going to be leading worship. We're going to, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1209s">00:20:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to help each other that way. And then, um, so the four or five and six and seven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1215s">00:20:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we dedicated four weeks to a high view of scripture, high view of scripture and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1222s">00:20:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that means. And we're going to be talking about the essential principles of hermeneutics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1226s">00:20:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, it's going to be reviewed for a lot of you, but I hope that you will have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1230s">00:20:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of discussion and opportunity to practice fundamental hermeneutical principles. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1237s">00:20:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not just how to do it, but to, to encourage you to do it and to establish daily disciplines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1243s">00:20:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of coming to the word of God yourself. And so that's the point of what we're doing there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1247s">00:20:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then high view of church three weeks and then the philosophy of evangelism and why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1251s">00:20:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we do evangelism the way we do at church. Okay. All right. So that's, that's how it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1256s">00:20:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">broken down. Um, one more thing, one more housekeeping thing before we get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1264s">00:21:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we are going to have snacks and because of the large group and there's 12, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1270s">00:21:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know how many groups we're going to end up having. So we have, so most likely we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1277s">00:21:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to have maybe at least two groups bring snacks together. Possibly three are going to, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1283s">00:21:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be teamed up together because of the large group. The number in here I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1287s">00:21:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is somewhere between one 60, uh, one 50 to one 60, maybe one 70. So those of you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1292s">00:21:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who are doing snacks, just keep that in mind that you're not doing it for 30 people. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1297s">00:21:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">doing for a hundred. That's why we're gonna have two people, two groups together. So starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1301s">00:21:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">next week, we don't have a sign small group. So if you know that your group, um, is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1307s">00:21:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay together, your group probably may be the best group to start next week. So please</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1313s">00:21:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">let us know ahead of time. And then I think today we're not going to have you sign up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1317s">00:21:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're not in your small groups today. Right. But if you do know, if you have two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1322s">00:22:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">groups that know that, you know, these are the groups that we want to stick with, please</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1326s">00:22:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">come and let us know so that we can assign you for next week. And then after that we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1330s">00:22:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have other groups do this, do the snacks. Okay. All right. Any questions about any of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1335s">00:22:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that? Okay. All right. Good. Now we can get going. Okay. Oh, you're going to, I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1349s">00:22:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I could do it. Yeah. Can you guys see with me standing right in the middle right here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1374s">00:22:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys can't see. Okay. So I was debating whether to put slides up or not today because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1383s">00:23:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of this. Um, all right, let me pray for us and we'll jump in.

So first and foremost, the greatest question that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1565s">00:26:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">need to ask is how do we worship God better if all things were made by him and for him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1570s">00:26:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So he doesn't exist for us.

So the fundamental question of what can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1576s">00:26:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">God do for me is a wrong question. There is no answer for that. Okay. Or the answer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1583s">00:26:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">already done because Christ has already done, right? Has given us eternal life. So the rest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1588s">00:26:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of our life is to be lived for his glory. So first and foremost, God centered worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1593s">00:26:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">refocuses our attention on him and not us. God's very nature demands it. The fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1603s">00:26:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we call him God and that we are creation in and of itself teaches us fundamentally that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1609s">00:26:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we exist for him and not him for us.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1708s">00:28:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">right view of God affects everything.

So wrong view of God will cause you to even evaluate what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1724s">00:28:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is good and what is bad.

So again, that's why this is the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1737s">00:28:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and the most important part of our worship. Our church ministry philosophy is a right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1743s">00:29:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">view of God, God-centered worship, not man-centered. The sins of Israel can be, can be divided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1751s">00:29:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">into three parts. One is idol worship, and that is a straight breaking of the first commandment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1757s">00:29:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">"Thou shalt have no other gods before me." And so there are periods in Israel's history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1761s">00:29:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">where they strayed so far away from God, they were guilty of Asherah worship, or Baal worship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1767s">00:29:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">or worship of Molech. And at one point was so corrupt in their sins that they were offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1773s">00:29:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">up their children for sacrifices to God of Molech, right? That's idol worship. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1779s">00:29:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly, you know, there's a clear line between right and wrong with that. Idol worship, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1784s">00:29:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, there's no way to defend that. But the sin that tripped Israel up more than anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1789s">00:29:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">else were the next two. The second was that they made graven images of Yahweh and worshipped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1796s">00:29:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And that's the breaking of the second commandment, where God said, "Thou shalt have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1800s">00:30:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">no graven images before me." There are two examples. I've only given one, but two examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1806s">00:30:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of this where the first one, I don't have it here, but the first one is Aaron. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1814s">00:30:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Moses is up in the mountain, he doesn't come down for a while. Remember what Aaron does,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1818s">00:30:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">he makes a golden calf, and then he presents it to the nation of Israel. And when he presents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1823s">00:30:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this golden calf to worship, he presents it to them and says, "This is the God who delivered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1828s">00:30:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">us from Egypt." So in his mind, he's not introducing a new God to Israel. He's introducing these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1836s">00:30:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">calves in replacement of Yahweh. They were waiting for God to come. And because he can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1841s">00:30:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">be seen, Aaron has a bright idea. Moses goes up and he's not here, and people are getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1846s">00:30:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">restless. What do we do? Who do we follow? And so Aaron has this bright idea, and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1851s">00:30:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">going to make an image of this God and present it to them. Right? So in his mind, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1856s">00:30:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">not idol worship. This is just a graven image. Right? We see the second, oh, I do have it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1863s">00:31:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Sorry. The second is Jeroboam. Okay? When the kingdom of Israel split into two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1871s">00:31:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeroboam, who rebels against Israel's kingdom, takes the ten tribes and he goes up to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1876s">00:31:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">south. And that's when the Israel splits. And he's afraid that because he's taken ten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1883s">00:31:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">tribes and gone up to the south, and Jerusalem is in the north, sorry, north, and Jerusalem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1888s">00:31:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is on the southern part, he decides that he's going to create another way for people to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1894s">00:31:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">go.

And he also makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1904s">00:31:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">golden calves and presents it to Israel. And he says the same thing in 1 Kings 12, 28.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=1910s">00:31:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is God who led you out of Egypt.

The reason why God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2097s">00:34:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">told them, again, I'm not going to go through these passages for the sake of time. In Numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2101s">00:35:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">33, verse 52, it talks about how God detests worship in high places because this is typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2108s">00:35:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">where the pagans gave worship to idols. So God gave very specific prescription of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2115s">00:35:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and where that they ought to worship God. And again, next week when Pastor Mark speaks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2121s">00:35:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">on the subject of Leviticus and how we ought to approach God, he's going to give us a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2125s">00:35:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more clarity as to why this is so important. The sin on the third of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2133s">00:35:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Southern Kingdom is that they were worshiping Yahweh, but they were worshiping Him in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2138s">00:35:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">manner that the pagans did. Right? And that's again, that's just something that we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2145s">00:35:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to be careful about.

It brings more people and the church grows when we do this. That that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2174s">00:36:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">not how we approach worship. That's not how we approach church. First and foremost, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2178s">00:36:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it's God-centered, if everything is made by Him and for Him, the most important question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2183s">00:36:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is who is He? And what does He desire? And how does He want us to worship Him? Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2191s">00:36:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the fundamental question that we're trying to establish in this class. Okay? First</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2197s">00:36:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and foremost. So this is this important. The next question is how did God then present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2203s">00:36:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Himself to Israel? God demanded to be regarded as holy to the nation of Israel. And you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2213s">00:36:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">going to see that there are many attributes of God, but the holiness, His character of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2218s">00:36:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness stands out above every other nature. And we're going to be talking about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2223s">00:37:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? First and foremost, the death of Nadab and Nebihu gives us a glimpse. Again, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2231s">00:37:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor Mark is going to be speaking about that. This is part of your, I think, quiet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2233s">00:37:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">time passage. I think maybe your first day, I think. Right? The death of, I'm not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2240s">00:37:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to go into it, but I want you to take a close look at the death of Nadab and Nebihu. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2245s">00:37:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">if you are reading that for the first time, it'll probably be a bit shocking to you. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2252s">00:37:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Because their only sin is they didn't do exactly what God told them to do. Nadab and Nebihu</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2259s">00:37:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">were the first two priests who gave the sacrifice to God, but they didn't follow directions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2264s">00:37:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And because they didn't follow directions, fire from heaven come down and consume them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2268s">00:37:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and they are punished. Right? They die. So, in our natural human paradigm, we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2274s">00:37:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at that and say, "Wow, God is very vengeful. Was that really worthy of death?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2279s">00:37:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? And again, when you have a worldly paradigm and you look at the stories of the Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2284s">00:38:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not going to make much sense to you. But this is the reason why knowing who God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2289s">00:38:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is is extremely, extremely important. Okay? And at the end of that, he says, "The reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2297s">00:38:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for their punishment," he says, and again, it's going to be in your quiet time this week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2301s">00:38:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that he said, "They did not consider me as holy." Right? If you have an ESV, it says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2308s">00:38:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the word that is used there is sanctified, but it is the same word in Hebrew for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2311s">00:38:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">word holy. So, if you have an ESV or NIV, or NASV or NIV, it'll say, "It's because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2319s">00:38:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">did not consider me holy." Right? So, that was their sin. That they didn't see him as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2325s">00:38:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">holy. Right? Moses, if you know this story, at the end of the 40 years of Israel's journey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2333s">00:38:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">again, they're complaining to Moses. "Why did you bring us out here?" And they're whining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2337s">00:38:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and complaining. And so, God says, "Give them the water that they're demanding." And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2342s">00:39:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">goes there and he strikes the rock and he says, "Here's your water." Remember what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2346s">00:39:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to him? He doesn't die, but he gets punished, and as a result of him doing that, he's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2356s">00:39:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">allowed to go into the Promised Land. Moses waited 40—he endured with these stiff-necked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2361s">00:39:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">people for 40 years, thinking that, "If I just endure, I can get into this Promised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2365s">00:39:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Land." But because of this one sin, and this sin of Moses was that he struck the rock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2372s">00:39:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not exactly sure what he did wrong. But the way God describes his sin was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2377s">00:39:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you didn't consider—you didn't show me as holy to the nation of Israel. Now, we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2382s">00:39:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">know if it was because he struck the rock or whether he was angry, but God says, whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2387s">00:39:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">he did do, that he didn't present himself—present Yahweh as holy. Right? That was the sin. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2394s">00:39:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that sin was so hideous before God that he was not allowed to enter into the Promised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2399s">00:39:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Land. If you look at the Lord's Prayer, again, you don't need to turn there, Matthew 6, 9</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2405s">00:40:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">through 13, when Jesus says, "Pray this way," and He begins, right? "Our Father, which art</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2411s">00:40:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">in heaven," and how does the next part go? "Hallowed be thy name." The word "hallowed,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2416s">00:40:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">again, either reverenced, or another way to put it is holy.

Now, I can give you example after example after example, but there's one attribute that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2436s">00:40:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely stands out above every other attribute. In fact, we can say that the history of Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2442s">00:40:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is to present to the nation of Israel and to the world the foundation of His nature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2447s">00:40:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of holiness. Right? Two separate places in the Bible where His attribute is repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2457s">00:40:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">three separate times consecutively. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2463s">00:41:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned in Isaiah 6, 3 and Revelations 4, 8. Right? No other place in the Bible where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2469s">00:41:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">any other attribute of God is repeated in this way. Again, those of you guys who know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2475s">00:41:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">who've been here for a while know that whenever you see a repetition in the Scripture, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2480s">00:41:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to stop and consider deeply what is being said. So when Jesus would stop and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2487s">00:41:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Peter, Peter," or "Truly, truly, I say something to you," and He would do it in repetition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2492s">00:41:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it is meant to be highlighted, to pay attention. Something that I'm going to be saying to you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2497s">00:41:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is extremely, extremely important. Twice in the Scripture, in the book of Isaiah and book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2503s">00:41:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of Revelation, where a prophet of God sees a glimpse of the throne of God and at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2512s">00:41:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">throne the creatures surrounding Him are declaring, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2519s">00:41:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that alone, even if I didn't mention anything else, but that alone should cause anybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2525s">00:42:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to take a step back and see that this is a nature of God that is singularly singled out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2531s">00:42:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">above all the others. And I know that again, in our generation, if there's any aspect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2536s">00:42:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">God or attribute of God that is singled out, it's probably His grace, His mercy, and His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2541s">00:42:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">love. It is important. It's absolutely essential. It is talked about. But no other place in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2548s">00:42:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible where it talks about God is love, love, love, grace, grace, grace, mercy, mercy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2553s">00:42:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy. And we don't want to diminish any one of those things. But this aspect of His holiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2559s">00:42:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is at the foundation of understanding of every other attribute. If you don't understand His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2565s">00:42:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness, you're not going to completely understand His love. If you don't understand His attribute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2572s">00:42:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of holiness, you're not going to understand His attribute of mercy. Because all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2577s">00:42:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">things are connected. There's a reason why two-thirds of the Old Testament is dedicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2586s">00:43:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sin utterly sinful. Basically, if you were to summarize in a nutshell the essence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2595s">00:43:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of what was happening in the Old Testament, which is two-thirds of the Bible, He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2599s">00:43:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that the law was given and we see a history of the nation of Israel who is constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2604s">00:43:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">sinning and coming before God, and God is being merciful. But it's curse, after curse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2609s">00:43:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">after curse. And He says, as we've been talking about on Sunday, it's to make sin utterly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2614s">00:43:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sinful. But the reason why sin is utterly sinful is because we have a progressive revelation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2621s">00:43:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of His holy nature. Sin is never utterly sinful when we compare it, when we don't compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2629s">00:43:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it to Holy, Holy, Holy God. The more we understand who He is, the more utterly sinful sin becomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2637s">00:43:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Sin is not sinful when you compare it with other sinners. We can always find sinners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2642s">00:44:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">who we think are worse than us, and it kind of makes our sin a little bit better. We don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2646s">00:44:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">feel as bad about our sins. See, but two-thirds of the Old Testament is sin in the presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2652s">00:44:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of this Holy God. So, again, this aspect of His holiness is at the foundation of understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2661s">00:44:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of everything that we do. So if God reveals Himself as Holy, if His nature is at the core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2669s">00:44:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of everything that we do, if at the core of His nature God emphasizes and highlights His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2676s">00:44:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness, then what does it mean to be holy? What does the Bible mean by holiness? There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2683s">00:44:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">two definitions. One is to be morally perfect or pure. In Habakkuk, chapter 1, verse 13,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2692s">00:44:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, "You who are purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong." But let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2701s">00:45:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">emphasize here. This is typically, when we think of holiness, we think about this aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2705s">00:45:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pure, He's perfect, He's morally, there's nothing wrong with Him, right? Which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2711s">00:45:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">correct definition, but we have to understand when we think about morally perfect, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2716s">00:45:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">different the way that you and I understand perfection. Because you and I understand someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2722s">00:45:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">who is morally perfect, the closer and closer that we are to His nature, to who He is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2729s">00:45:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">God is not morally perfect because He keeps a standard of right and wrong that is independent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2734s">00:45:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of Him. I hope you're following along. God is morally perfect because He Himself is holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2745s">00:45:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What is right and wrong stem from who He is. If He says to kill, that's the right thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2750s">00:45:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. If He says eat, then that's the right thing to do. If He says not to eat, then that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2755s">00:45:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the right thing to do. So His nature of perfection and morally being upright is different than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2761s">00:46:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">us. We have a set of right and wrong, and the closer we keep that, we're morally perfect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2766s">00:46:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So typically, when we think of God being holy, that's the first definition that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2771s">00:46:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we have. But the definition that really encompasses all the other things is related to the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2778s">00:46:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">part, okay? It's to be set apart. To be set apart. R.C. Sproul, and I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2793s">00:46:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">read that part to you, he says, "The primary meaning of holy is to be separate. It comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2799s">00:46:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">from an ancient word that meant to cut or to separate. Perhaps even more accurate would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2805s">00:46:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">be the phrase, 'a cut above something.' When we find a garment or another piece of merchandise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2809s">00:46:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that is outstanding, that has a superior excellence, we use the expression that it is cut above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2814s">00:46:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest." Right? It is different. There's nothing like Him. Right? That's the word holy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2819s">00:46:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can take an object that was common, and you would dedicate it to the Lord, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2825s">00:47:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">what would happen to that object? It became holy. Right? Because now, it was for His use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2832s">00:47:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The holy temple, before it was just a bunch of dirt, and they put it together, and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2837s">00:47:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">was bricks, but if you made the house for you to live in, it would be common. But if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2841s">00:47:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that temple was dedicated to the Lord, what did it become? It became holy. Right? So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2847s">00:47:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">second definition of it is not simply to be morally upright, but anything that is separated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2851s">00:47:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for Him. It's cut above. Right? It is different. Now why is this definition so important? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2858s">00:47:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">when something is related to God, it takes something that is common, and then it becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2866s">00:47:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">something weighty. Right? Sorry. This part, I don't think it's in your notes, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2873s">00:47:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">going to jot it down. I encourage you to do the third part. To be set apart. To say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2880s">00:48:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">He is holy means that He is not meant to be considered as common, or anything associated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2892s">00:48:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">with Him to be common. The word used to describe expression of holiness is glory. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2899s">00:48:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">when His holiness is declared and is expressed, we say that we are glorifying Him, or we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2906s">00:48:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">His glory. Right? Basically, His glory is an expression of His attribute. Right? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2912s">00:48:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">follow? The word glory itself means to be weighty. Heavy. Right? Or something serious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2919s">00:48:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Not to be taken lightly. So what that means is, the very essence of the definition of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2927s">00:48:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness means that there's, again, that He is perfect, that He is cut above, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2933s">00:48:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing like Him, and that there is a weightiness. Right? That we are not to take it lightly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2940s">00:49:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything that He says is holy. Everything He says is holy. It's not meant to be talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2949s">00:49:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">about lightly. Everything that He says was to be treasured and taken seriously. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2955s">00:49:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">God shows up and He's in His presence, what does He make Moses do? Take his feet off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2961s">00:49:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">shoes off. Because what? What kind of ground is it? It is holy ground. So when it is holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2966s">00:49:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">ground, what does He mean? That you are not to stand here like you're standing in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2970s">00:49:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">presence of just any bush. This is where God is. Right? Whenever anything was related to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2977s">00:49:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">God, it was meant to be taken seriously, because there are serious consequences. Right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2984s">00:49:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the definition of holiness. There's a weightiness of what it is. So again, let me step back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2990s">00:49:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to be talking about this more on the third session. The very essence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=2996s">00:49:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">who God is requires us to search His Word carefully to figure out who He is. Today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3003s">00:50:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the way we worship God has become more and more adjusted so that more and more can feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3009s">00:50:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable exactly the way they are. That is not worship. Worship is common people coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3016s">00:50:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">before a holy, holy, holy God and being changed in the presence of His glory. Right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3025s">00:50:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">worship. So fundamentally, our idea of making, adjusting the church and adjusting everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3032s">00:50:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're doing so that more and more things can become more and more common to attract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3038s">00:50:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more people. And then we have to diminish less and less of the definition of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3044s">00:50:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">holiness. We can say the word holy, but if we don't understand the meaning of holiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3048s">00:50:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in the way that Scripture describes it, then we're going to miss the whole point of why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3052s">00:50:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we gather together. Right? We're not here to just listen to some words. We're not here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3057s">00:50:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to make friends. Ultimately, we're here to approach a holy, holy, holy God. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3064s">00:51:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">even when we talk about approaching the throne of grace with confidence, it's a throne that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3070s">00:51:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we're approaching. It is a throne of grace, but it is a throne. It is a king that we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3075s">00:51:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">approaching. So oftentimes, even when we talk about grace, we don't have this concept of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3079s">00:51:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">His weightiness, of His glory, and we kind of have this image of like this grandpa that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3084s">00:51:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we're kind of coming to embrace. Nowhere in the Scripture do we see that. That's an image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3090s">00:51:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of God that we've created in our own heads. Search the Scriptures anywhere, New Testament</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3096s">00:51:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or the Old Testament, any illustration, anywhere in the Bible where you see where God shows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3100s">00:51:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">up and people run to embrace Him. Right? That is not the image that we see in the Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3107s">00:51:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That is an image that we've created in our culture to accommodate the masses, but that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3112s">00:51:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">is not what we see in Scripture. Right? Everything associated with God is holy. Instances, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3119s">00:51:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to end with this for today. If everything stems from His nature, at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3128s">00:52:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">core of His nature is His holiness. The definition of His holiness is to be set apart, to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3135s">00:52:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">weighty and serious, and there's nothing like Him. So it relates to His love. The love that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3144s">00:52:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">He talks about is holy, is cut above. It's different than any other love that you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3150s">00:52:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">His judgment is holy. It's different than any other judgment that we know. So even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3155s">00:52:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we use illustrations like, "Well, His love is like the love of the mother," no, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3158s">00:52:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">not. There's nothing to compare with. That's what it means to be holy. Right? When we talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3164s">00:52:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">about His power, "Oh, His power is like the nuclear bomb," no, it's not. There's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3169s">00:52:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can compare it with. That's what it means to be holy, that He is set apart. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3174s">00:52:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a weightiness of everything that we're doing. So I'm going to give you some examples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3178s">00:52:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture. And again, we can comb through all the way from Genesis to Revelation, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3183s">00:53:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I can give you countless numbers of examples of people encountering God. And it is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3188s">00:53:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this picture that, again, in our generation that we've drawn of who God is. 2 Samuel 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3196s">00:53:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">1 through 11. And I want to, I know it's a little bit lengthy, but I want to read to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3201s">00:53:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Some of you guys know the background behind this. And this is one of the books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3209s">00:53:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that we used to have the whole church read. And again, if you haven't read this, we highly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3213s">00:53:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">highly encourage you to get this book and read it and read it carefully. If you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3217s">00:53:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a small group that, you know, you don't know what to read, read this first. Okay? Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3223s">00:53:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">for the sake of time, I'm not going to go too deep into it, but the story behind this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3226s">00:53:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the Ark of the Covenant was stolen by the Philistines. And this is a scene where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3232s">00:53:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">David conquers, again, wins the battle over the Philistines. And they're bringing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3236s">00:53:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Ark of the Covenant back to Israel. But in this scene, they put the Ark of the Covenant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3242s">00:54:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">on a cart being pulled by an ox. And Uzzah, who happens to be a priest, when the cart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3252s">00:54:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">stumbles and it's about to fall to the ground, he reaches out and he saves it from touching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3257s">00:54:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the ground and he brings it back up. And at the end of that, you would say, "Wow, he did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3262s">00:54:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a great thing. He prevented the Ark of the Covenant from crashing to the ground." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3266s">00:54:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in God's eyes, he sinned. His sin was so horrible that he ends up dying. Right? In that passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3275s">00:54:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no explanation. When we read that passage, we can look at that and say, "Wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3279s">00:54:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that was pretty random. Instead of being rewarded for saving the Ark of the Covenant, God actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3284s">00:54:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">punishes him." And I think R.C. Sproul does such a great job describing this. So, I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3288s">00:54:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a little bit lengthy, but I want you guys to pay attention to what he says. Uzzah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3296s">00:54:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a Kohathite. Kohathite is one of the tribes of the priests. He knew exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3300s">00:55:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">what his duties were. He had been trained thoroughly in the discipline of his calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3305s">00:55:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He understood that God had declared that the touching of the Ark of the Covenant was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3308s">00:55:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">capital offense. No Kohathite under any circumstance was ever permitted to touch the Ark. No emergency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3316s">00:55:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">was grounds for breaking that inviolate command. The elaborate construction of the Ark, complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3322s">00:55:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with golden rings through which the long poles were inserted, was so fashioned as to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3326s">00:55:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it clear that the Ark itself was not to be touched. The men commissioned to transport</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3331s">00:55:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the Ark could touch only the poles and the rings. Then it was the task of the Kohathites</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3336s">00:55:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to carry the Ark by these long poles. No provision was made for hurrying the procedure by transporting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3342s">00:55:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the Ark via an ox cart. We must ask the question, what was the Ark doing on an ox cart in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3347s">00:55:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">first place? God was so strict about the holy things of the tabernacle that the Kohathites</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3352s">00:55:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">were not allowed even to gaze upon the Ark. This too was a capital crime. God had decreed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3358s">00:55:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that if a Kohathite merely glanced at the Ark and the Holy of Holies for an instant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3362s">00:56:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he would die. Not only was Uzzah forbidden to touch the Ark, he was forbidden even to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3367s">00:56:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">look at it. He touched it anyway. He stripped out his hand and placed it squarely on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3372s">00:56:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Ark, steadying it in place lest it fall to the ground. An act of holy heroism. No, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3380s">00:56:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">was an act of arrogance, a sin of presumption. Uzzah assumed that his hand was less polluted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3386s">00:56:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">than the earth. But it wasn't the ground or the mud that would desecrate the Ark, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3391s">00:56:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the touch of man.

It does what God tells it to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3396s">00:56:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It brings forth its yield in its season. It obeys the laws of nature that God had established.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3403s">00:56:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When the temperature falls to a certain point, the ground freezes.

So Isaiah was expecting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3518s">00:58:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">die because he saw God, because the Israelites understood.

That's exactly the word that is used. In fact, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/183850945#t=3674s">01:01:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">not just the word itself.
