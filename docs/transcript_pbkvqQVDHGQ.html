Yeah, they should. Have they ever been to this? No. Should. You should be here. We literally practiced this song for 1.5. We're not playing in Francis and-- Oh, yeah, right. We're playing at  That's what I said-- Ted told John.</p><p>I texted him and said, hey, here's a new plan. Not guaranteed until, like, Friday night. But Mitchell's been telling us and told us to tell our teams. I don't know what I'm going to be doing, but I probably will be done by 10. When do you start? 6.30. The lights will be on.</p><p>All the lights will be on. I have no idea. You have to interact. Oh. It looks like you just got a haircut, right? Yeah. It was hot today. It was hot tonight. It was kind of warm. It was really windy. It was. So flat. Yeah. It's because it's dark.</p><p>I'm not used to-- I can't actually read music. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. These brackets, when it has this and then the two dots there, it means repeat. So you would go from here until you see your eight here. The first time through, you go to here, and then you go back up here.</p><p>Second time through, all the way here. Then you go to the second one. And then you keep playing through. There's no bracket. You're never going to finish. You keep going. Same thing here. And then you see it again here. It repeats from here and then back to here. That's like the average.</p><p>That's like the music. And it says the tempo here, 3-2-2-2. It took me the longest time to realize this. The notation is different from this one. Yeah. This is more what you would play as a guitar. Actually, I just got two columns. All good. I'll figure it out. OK, it's pretty simple.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. Hey. You had "Dan and Dan," so-- Oh, yeah. I didn't even--  I didn't even notice that last week. Yeah, they had "Dan and Dan" last week. That's funny. Now, we're replacing "Shade and Shake." I didn't even notice that until someone brought it up. I was like, oh, wait, it is "Kim and Tim."  It's a plan.</p><p>We're just going for the four-shaped pattern now. Yeah, yeah. We're just going--  Oh, yeah. We're just doing the same thing. Oh. How was work? It's been hectic. It's been a crazy week. After today, I feel a lot better. I had to brief my director on something. I just got that out of the way.</p><p>Now, it's just busy. But it's not like a chaotic kind of hectic. Hopefully, it'll calm down soon. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping after this week--  --job, deadline, and finish it all back in time. Oh, yeah. OK, well, we'll give you the most urgent thing. Yeah, that's tough. Yeah, that's tough.</p><p>But the nice thing is I get to say, I volunteered for it. Yeah. You can't even blame me. Yeah, yeah. How about you? It's been pretty busy, too. Work, I could-- You're kind of busy, or like-- Everything's on fire. A little bit of everything on fire. OK. We had a bunch of deadlines and stuff due this-- like, tomorrow.</p><p>Oh. But my lead was like, yeah, we're calling up in the bank tomorrow. Because the other teams were making a bunch of changes on these drawings. We were taking everything off them. So it's like--  We were like, honestly, we can only go over what we did. And they kept adding more stuff than what we were supposed to do, however.</p><p>So it's like-- So now we're incrementing. But we got to think about it. OK. OK. He's kind of busy, and at least he can't be blamed for it. What? Oh, no. No, but I did like the automation thing. Oh, no. I mean, because I did college. So I have every week.</p><p>This setup is not that great for a full band. You can declare the full band. All right. Let's get started. Yep. Next couple of minutes. Did you worship like-- Like high school? Or like middle school? Middle school. Oh, you're a home church? No, third college. Third college. First time in my life.</p><p>Nice. Thanks for-- Of course. You've got to get more band guys to worship, because Jeremy's leaving now. So--  We'll see. I'm sure there's plenty out there. I heard about that, too. All right. Good evening, everyone. Let's take a minute to just prepare your heart for worship, and then I'll lead us in prayer.</p><p>Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the time that we have tonight to study through your word. God, I thank you for bringing us all here to worship you. And Lord, use the time that we have tonight to challenge and encourage our hearts, to teach us more about who you are, your grace, your love, and your power, that we might respond in faith, that we might apply these things into our lives.</p><p>So Lord, just bless this time of praise. And I pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen. Blessed be your name, your land that is plentiful, your streams of abundance flow. Blessed be your name. Blessed be your name, when you're found in the desert place, and you walk through the wilderness.</p><p>Blessed be your name. Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name. Blessed be your name, as all is shining to know you.</p><p>When the world's all eyes are shipped, blessed be your name. Blessed be your name. When the Lord walks with suffering, his great and beloved, blessed be your name. Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, blessed be the name of the Lord.</p><p>Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name. Give it to the boy. Give and take away. Give and take away.</p><p>My heart will choose to say, your blessing be your name. Give and take away. Give and take away. My heart will choose to say, your blessing be your name. Say it again, somebody. Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, blessed be the name of the Lord.</p><p>Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name. Alright, well good evening. Um, so today we're going to be going over 1 through 9 of chapter 3.</p><p>The section technically should end at verse 14, but if we assigned you 14 verses to do at home, some of you guys would probably freak out. So we're just doing the 9 and then 10 to 14 next week. But let me read the passage, I'll go over the questions, and then we'll pray, and we'll break up into our groups.</p><p>"You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? This is the only thing I want to find out from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</p><p>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if indeed it was in vain? So then, does he who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith? Even so, Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</p><p>Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham. The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'All the nations will be blessed in you.' So then, those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer." So here are the questions.</p><p>You're going to be going over verses 1 through 9. And then the second thing that...or what we want you guys to kind of think through as you're discussing is, what is happening amongst the Christians in Galatia? Third, in context, what is the role of the Spirit in the life of the blessed believer?</p><p>This is the first time the word "Spirit" is mentioned, and it's mentioned three times just in these verses. And what is the purpose of the mention of Abraham? So why does Paul go into Abraham? Right now, it's 716. At 810, we're going to just reconvene. But let me pray for us, and then we can break up into our small groups.</p><p>Father, we're very thankful that you allow us to gather together to study your Word. Lord, for some of us, it's very weighty and very heavy, almost academic. But for some of us, we can't get enough. And for others of us, there's a numbness. And I pray, Father, regardless of why we've come, we're here wanting to hear your Word, wanting to examine our hearts before your Word.</p><p>So I pray that you would provide for us just a great humility of heart, just a willingness to listen to your Word. And Lord, that in our small groups, that we really would be encouraged by the fellowship over your Word. So we thank you for just our time in advance, and we ask for your provision and your protection over each and every group.</p><p>So we thank you, God, for our time together, and we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. We'll see you guys at 820, or 810. Thank you, Lord, for just the time that we've had to study these nine verses. And we pray for your provision, your protection, and your guidance as we continue to track through Galatians.</p><p>And we pray this in Jesus' name. You</p></div></body></html>
