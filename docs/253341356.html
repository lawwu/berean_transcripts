was to cover the first three chapters of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=63s">00:01:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I was studying, I realized it's just way too much material to go over in one day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=68s">00:01:08.160</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=71s">00:01:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">us a good foundation for how to understand the rest of the passages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=76s">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So next week, my intention is to go through chapter two and three, but chapter six and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=80s">00:01:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">seven is really kind of an additional passages for the first five chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=86s">00:01:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a possibility I may get to chapter two and then just end up doing chapter two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=90s">00:01:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">as well.</span></div><div

know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=130s">00:02:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm referring to.</span></div><div class="c"><span

content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=143s">00:02:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to understand it.</span></div><div

passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=148s">00:02:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=149s">00:02:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's chapter one, next week, chapter two and three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=153s">00:02:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=155s">00:02:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just jump right in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=156s">00:02:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to have to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=169s">00:02:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first part of it is just a brief review of what we talked about last time, how Leviticus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=175s">00:02:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is an instructional manual on how a sinner can have a relationship with a holy God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=183s">00:03:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to summarize what the intent of the book of Leviticus and why he's doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=187s">00:03:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that he's doing is how can God's sinful people approach a holy God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=194s">00:03:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the theme of the book of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=196s">00:03:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we saw that Exodus, Exodus is the Lord coming to Israel and establish the tent of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=204s">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span

Egypt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=209s">00:03:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They come out and God gives the law instructions and then the book of Exodus ends with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=214s">00:03:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">establishment of the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=217s">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=218s">00:03:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, if you haven't read, you may be saying, well, what is a tabernacle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=222s">00:03:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the very reason why I really need you guys to read before you come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=226s">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have to explain to you what a tabernacle is, what the altar is and what incense is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=231s">00:03:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know, if you have no idea, if it's the first time hearing it, then it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=234s">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go over your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=235s">00:03:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I strongly encourage you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=237s">00:03:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I guarantee you, right, if you come prepared and you understand even 50% of what is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=246s">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">taught in Leviticus, it will open up the New Testament to you like it has never, never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=252s">00:04:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">done before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=254s">00:04:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because Leviticus is the preparation for understanding of fundamental doctrines of atonement, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=261s">00:04:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">propitiation, of blood sacrifice, laying on of hands, sacrifice without blemish, the Lamb</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=268s">00:04:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, all these gospel terms are saturated in the book of Leviticus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=275s">00:04:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's not just somebody saying, oh, here comes the Lamb of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=278s">00:04:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">A Jew would have had a clear picture of that Lamb of God that's being slaughtered through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=282s">00:04:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=283s">00:04:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically what this is, it gives you a physical illustration of the gospel itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=290s">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to prepare for the coming of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=291s">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if you just kind of come casually, I'm thankful that you come either way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=298s">00:04:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I know a lot of you guys come in after long days of work, so I know you guys are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=301s">00:05:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=302s">00:05:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're going to come, make the most of it, take the time to study, and try to</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=311s">00:05:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't emphasize this enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=312s">00:05:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not one of those studies you can just casually walk in and then walk out and think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=318s">00:05:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to be able to follow along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=319s">00:05:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really strongly encourage you to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=321s">00:05:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Exodus is the study of the Lord calling or coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=337s">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the book of Numbers is him dwelling among us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=351s">00:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see the same pattern also in the New Testament, where Israel serves as a model</span></div><div

God creating Adam, and then Adam falls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=399s">00:06:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the fall of man

says, "Do you not know that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=426s">00:07:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">now are the temple of

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=473s">00:07:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the tabernacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=490s">00:08:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Numbers, it'll basically list God's plan of how he wants each of the tribes to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=497s">00:08:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">be located, all centered around the

God, is right in the middle of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=504s">00:08:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the camp, and then the Levites, who are priests, who represent the people, are in between,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=510s">00:08:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who are these?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=512s">00:08:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The 12 tribes of Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=514s">00:08:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is how God wanted Israel to camp every time they sat down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=518s">00:08:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So every time they picked up, God had specific orders, which tribe goes first, and they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=524s">00:08:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to march in order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=525s">00:08:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of like a military, like basic training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=528s">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then whenever they stop, they have to stop in this order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=532s">00:08:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was never any variation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=535s">00:08:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They always, for 40 years, as long as they march, this is how their camp looked like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=542s">00:09:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a purpose for that, because no matter where they were at, at any given time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=550s">00:09:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they were at, again, a short distance to the tabernacle, every single one of these tribes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=555s">00:09:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we're talking about God's presence dwelling in the midst of Israel, it was literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=560s">00:09:20.120</a></span> | <span

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=564s">00:09:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're studying through the book of Leviticus is, if God is dwelling here, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=569s">00:09:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do these people get to him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=574s">00:09:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what Leviticus is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=576s">00:09:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today, and for the next few days, we're going to be talking about the establishment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=581s">00:09:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sacrificial system, and then chapter 8 and on, if you remember the outline, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=587s">00:09:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about the priests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=590s">00:09:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first part of it is about the sacrifices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=594s">00:09:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The second part of it is the priests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=595s">00:09:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a third part, but we'll talk about that later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=600s">00:10:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Did I turn it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=611s">00:10:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some pictures for you guys to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=615s">00:10:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually went to a, what do you call it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=621s">00:10:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Saddleback actually had a ministry that actually sets up a literal tabernacle in the life-size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=627s">00:10:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">version, and so I thought that would be interesting, so I actually went and took a look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=632s">00:10:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first thing that struck me about the

million people out in the desert, all having access to God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=643s">00:10:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the sacrifice, I thought that it would be humongous, like at least a football field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=648s">00:10:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=649s">00:10:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Actuality, it's somewhere between about 75 feet to about 150 feet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=654s">00:10:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not exactly sure of the dimensions of this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=658s">00:10:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So from here to back of that room would be about 100 feet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=662s">00:11:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Did it go dark?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=664s">00:11:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, you couldn't see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=666s">00:11:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from here to here, it's about 130, I think, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=670s">00:11:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically the size of the tabernacle is about the size of this room, maybe a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=675s">00:11:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bit longer, a little bit narrower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=677s">00:11:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So no, it would be narrower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=680s">00:11:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it would be something like this, more of a rectangle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=682s">00:11:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=684s">00:11:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this sat right in the middle of the camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=686s">00:11:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you look at it, this, let me see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=692s">00:11:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this right here would be the holies, and it's divided into two parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=698s">00:11:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we talk about the details of this, we'll talk about it at another time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=701s">00:11:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is where usually the person who's getting sacrificed is never allowed to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=708s">00:11:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=713s">00:11:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a version of outside picture, and this is the inside picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=720s">00:12:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the dimensions of this is pretty accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=723s">00:12:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if they built this to size, but it's pretty accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=728s">00:12:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you can notice, and then here's more of a close-up picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=733s">00:12:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this would be the altar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=741s">00:12:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">This would be the leaven where they would wash the animal parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=747s">00:12:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you read chapter one, you'll know they'll take the intestines and different parts of</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/253341356#t=754s">00:12:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the sacrifice would actually be offered here.</span></div><div class="c"><span
