href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=263s">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Apostle Paul expects that the people he is talking to, that they be wise enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=270s">00:04:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=271s">00:04:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's been quite interesting because he's been frustrated with their wisdom and discernment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=277s">00:04:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, I expect you to be discerning enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=285s">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, to follow his argument and his train of reasoning, it kind of comes out as like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=295s">00:04:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm speaking to you in this way, you need to judge what I'm saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=299s">00:04:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like follow what I'm saying, like get it, you

them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=305s">00:05:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me take a moment to think about that with you guys for a moment is, you know, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=313s">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">making an argument now, but realize that his argument has been building since the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=319s">00:05:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the letter, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=321s">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">His argument has been building from the beginning of the letter where he began saying, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=325s">00:05:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys are believers and I thank God for you, every single one of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=330s">00:05:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, and he essentially has a warm fatherly attitude towards everybody in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=337s">00:05:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But then as he's writing to them, he starts building this argument about how they need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=341s">00:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to be humble, how they need to be united and essentially mature in every single way you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=346s">00:05:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can think of and purity and everything, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=350s">00:05:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But he comes back to this point as he's talking to them is, I want you to be wise enough and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=355s">00:05:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I expect you to be discerning enough.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=362s">00:06:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And earlier I mentioned that I love this book because it really is a call to maturity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=370s">00:06:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I find that perhaps there is a frustration in him saying like, you guys don't get it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=377s">00:06:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but I expect you to get

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=395s">00:06:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine when there's somebody who is a Christian and he's learning, and he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/141712526#t=401s">00:06:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">learning principles and truth, he could be pointing at a very
