I'm going to read all the way down to verse 25, but we're probably going to not get through all of it today. Romans Chapter 4, 13-25. Reading out of the ESV. Romans Chapter 4, 13-25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=21s">00:00:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Reading from ESV]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=50s">00:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Reading from ESV]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=79s">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Reading from ESV]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=102s">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we entrust this morning to you, asking for the power of your Holy Spirit to convict, renew, sanctify. As you promised us that faith comes from hearing, and the hearing of the word of Christ. I pray that our faith may be strengthened, our vision for Him will be clearer, and that our love for Him may grow as a result. So we entrust this time to you, in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=130s">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we've been pounding the subject of justification by faith, that our salvation is not by works, it is not by our heritage. That Paul has been arguing this, again, to these Jews who are relying on their confidence, obedience to the law, and saying that possibly because of their circumcision that they have a special standing before God. And Paul, again and again, is pounding against that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=156s">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Justification by faith, if you really sit down and think about it, is not an easy doctrine to swallow. Basically what Paul has been saying is, all the stuff that the Nation of Israel and the Jews and the Pharisees have been working so diligently to obey, in the eyes of God, adds nothing to their righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=176s">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he simply says that salvation is simply because he believed. Not necessarily because of what he's done, but because he believed. So imagine having lived to earn righteousness all your life, and all of a sudden Paul says, "All of that's for nothing." Then what? If that's not the right path of salvation, then how do we get saved? He says, "Well, you just need to believe."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=202s">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of you who've made a confession of faith, my guess is that you didn't have a hard time struggling and wrestling with it in the beginning. Somebody preached the Gospel and you just believed it. And you heard that the God of the universe loved you so much that he gave his only begotten son, and if you believed that he died for you, and it was only by faith, that whether you raised a hand, whether you came down the aisle, whether somebody led you in a sinner's prayer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=231s">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe it was just in your room, and you just prayed quietly before God, or maybe you don't even remember a particular time, but you know that at some point in your life, you began to believe that this was true. And you didn't earn it. You didn't have to jump through the hoops. There was nothing required of you, because from the very beginning, you were taught that salvation is by grace and grace alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=252s">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is absolutely true. But a typical pattern that a Christian goes through in really understanding and accepting this doctrine, we begin because it is easy. Because there is nothing required. Why wouldn't you? If God of the universe loved me, and you believed it, and that's what saved you, why wouldn't you receive it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as time goes by, and we begin to really reflect upon what this means, we begin to wrestle with it. Especially as you begin to see who God is, that God created the universe, and he was much bigger and much greater than you've ever imagined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=295s">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only has he become greater, the more you lived, the more disappointed you become of yourself. You look at your own sins, and how often you wrestle with even your own disciplines, how easily you get distracted. And in the back of your mind, you may begin to ask yourself, and you begin to struggle, "God loves me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=317s">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You may never express it that way, but you begin to doubt. Doubt begins to come in, because you feel a sense of unworthiness. There's a constant battling back and forth, trying to appease God. And you know that in your mind, that you can't earn righteousness, but there's a part of you that is working hard to appease God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have some weeks that are good, and you feel good about being at church and serving, and then there's some weeks that you are not doing so well and distracted, and you feel this guilt in the back of your mind, like, "I know he loves me theologically, but does he genuinely, truly love me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=354s">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that persists, we begin to actually question God. "Does God really love me? I know he's a God of love. I know he loves the world, but does he love me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=367s">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me ask you, when was the last time you were truly convicted about that, and you really sensed that God loved you? The very thing that caused you to be saved. The very thing that caused you to surrender your life to Christ. Because you believed that the God of the universe cared about you enough to send his only begotten son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=387s">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If that doubt begins to persist for a while, and it's been a while since you've connected with this God, that doubt of his love eventually turns to doubt period. It goes from "God loves me" to "God loves me" to "Does God really love me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=407s">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe he doesn't love me, and then eventually, "Does God even exist?" Because God is spirit. He's not somebody that we can just come to see and see. You know? We don't just come to church and say, "Oh, there he is," and we reconnect with him because you came to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=422s">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can come to church year after year and never meet God. Because he is spirit. So if it's been a long time since you have any kind of interaction with God, any kind of conviction of his love for you particular, after a while you begin to question and begin to even doubt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=440s">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only his love for you, but even his existence, because you haven't seen him. All of this, if you really break it down and take a deep look at it, is a wrestling over this doctrine of justification by faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=456s">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a part of us that, again, it was easy enough to begin, but as we persevere in our faith, as life comes at us and difficulties and trials and entanglement begins to come into our lives, we really begin to wonder, "Does thatâ€”I believe in God, but does that God care about me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=478s">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Am I really able to come to him with a clear conscience in the state that I am, knowing who I am, knowing what I have?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=486s">00:08:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why salvation by faith alone is easily received, but takes a lifetime of wrestling to struggle and embrace and ultimately be transformed by it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=497s">00:08:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lifetime of wrestling and struggling with this doctrine, what it means to you personally, and why that doctrine is the center of what causes us to come to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=507s">00:08:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is the reason why we worship him. It is the reason why we have confidence. It is the reason why we pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=513s">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why Paul rebukes the Galatian church in Galatians 3.3, "Are you so foolish? Having been begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected in the flesh?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=524s">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many people have fallen away because they began to doubt the love of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=530s">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many people resist God because they feel like they need to get their life straight before they can come to God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=535s">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That they need to somehow appease God before they can ever come to him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=539s">00:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it is the rejection of justification by faith and faith alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=545s">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my intent this morning is, as we jump through this text, as we dissect this text from 13 to 25,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=552s">00:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those of you who read the Facebook post about, you know, if you want to prepare better for sermons, I thought it would be good for you to kind of get a heads up and just read, at least read through it and know what's in this text so that you can be better hearers of the word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=565s">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are three main things, main arguments that Paul really gives. He doesn't say, "Here's my argument one, argument two, argument three." Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=573s">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's three main arguments that I've found in this text, and I'm going to present them to you, but I'm not going to really get to the other two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=580s">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as I was preparing, I found out that the first point really has three points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=585s">00:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I end up giving all points, I'm going to end up having, how many is that, five points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=590s">00:09:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't have enough time to go through five points. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with one, give you the outline, and then we'll get to the other two next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=597s">00:09:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll kind of have a better sense of where we're going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=600s">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me tell you, the argument that Paul makes of why justification, why salvation can only be by faith and faith alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=608s">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first argument he gives is the covenant that he made with Abraham was based on promise and not by contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=616s">00:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the first point. And so we're going to spend most of this morning talking about that first point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=623s">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The covenant that God made with Abraham was based on promise and not by contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=629s">00:10:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other two points that we're going to wait till next week is the second point is a covenant was based on God's power and not man's power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=637s">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That we'll see in verse 17 and on. The covenant that God made with Abraham was based on God's power and not man's power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=644s">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third point of the covenant is a covenant was based on God's faithfulness and not man's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=650s">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that we will see in verse 18 through 20. So this morning we'll be looking at verse 13 to part of verse 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=657s">00:10:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first point, the covenant was based on the promise and not by contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=664s">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that he says about this promise and what is the meaning behind why he argues that salvation is by promise and not by negotiation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=673s">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the title of the message this morning, not by contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=676s">00:11:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's three sub points that I want to look at this morning to help us better understand Paul's logic in trying to convince these Jews who are having a hard time letting go of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/164582082#t=686s">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Understandably, right?
