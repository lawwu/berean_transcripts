I grew up on an island called Saipan in the Pacific Ocean, and I started attending church at an early age with my mom and my sister. I don't remember the details, but I do remember standing up to accept Jesus at our church summer VBS. Sadly, I don't remember if I really knew what I was standing up for. Maybe it's because all the other kids were standing up. I always went to church growing up, and in a different island called Guam, I was baptized when I was in high school. Again, the details are a bit fuzzy, and I'm not too sure what I was thinking or believing at that time. Come to think about it, because of my inability to remember such a significant event, I have a lot of doubts about my belief and acceptance of Christ while I was in high school. From Guam, I moved to Irvine to attend UCI and started attending church, and I remember in college, I was really passionate as a Christian. I went to church as often as I could. I went on two short-term missions and was actively serving at church. Yet even for my college years, always going to church, serving, sadly, I don't really remember acknowledging the gravity of my sinfulness or having that great thankfulness of Christ saving my soul or desiring to really know God myself through his words. I don't remember studying the Bible much either to know about God and about Jesus, and it's likely that I served church to glorify myself. Personality-wise, I know I'm very conscious of what others think, especially at church, and my service might have been to satisfy that personality need. What I can remember clearly is when I started attending Berean, I began to ask a lot of questions about church, about myself, about my faith, about my salvation, and about the doubts that would often creep into my mind when I felt to sin. Is my faith genuine? Do I have real assurance of salvation? God gave me this desire to know more about him through his words and the messages that were preached in order to answer those questions. I remember learning for the first time, at least from what I can remember, about Genesis 315, the first mention of the gospel in the Bible. I remember being blown away that the hope of Christ was stated from the beginning, and as a Christian, a lifelong Christian, a bit ashamed that I didn't know this. It helped that the church leadership constantly reminded us to read and study his words ourselves. And by doing so, it led me to realize how sinful I am, that I'm deserving of death and condemnation. Yet because of his love for me, Christ died, shed his blood, resurrected, so that I can be forgiven of my sins and be united with God. Colossians 1, 21 to 22 reads, "And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshy body through death in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach." And because of that, I have hope. I constantly fall to sin, turn and drift from God, much like the Israelites, and yet there is hope for me because of what Christ has done. His blood has cleansed me once and for all. As a child of God, I can now find true rest in God. The burden of working, providing for my family, and just dealing with the chaos of my life, it's doable for me because I can find rest in the arms of my Father. Constantly in my life, I have sought the things of the world to find comfort. Yet I realized that true rest and peace comes from being in the presence of my Father above. Being a dad myself, I would pretty much do anything to provide for my kids and to protect them. Even if they don't listen, even if they make mistakes, even if they told me that they hate me, I'll continue to love them and do all that I can for them. I know and I believe that God's love for me is so much greater than that, more than I can comprehend or imagine. I know there will be struggles and difficulties as I live my short life on earth, but it is my hope and prayer that I won't drift away and waste my life. But focus my eyes on Christ and run this race with His guidance. Thank you for listening.    This might not work after.  Thanks, seriously, thank you so much for that testimony. What a reminder for all of us that everything that you said is true for every single one of us. As much as we love our kids, God loves all of you. So, you understand when you go into the water that you are being united with Christ in His death? When you come out, you are being united with His resurrected life? Yes, I do. And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p></div></body></html>
