class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=160s">00:02:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of prayer and what is prayer, it's not easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=164s">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not easy to define the structure, the parameter of what prayer is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=168s">00:02:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty, if you want to be exhaustive about it, there's a lot of stuff to cover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=173s">00:02:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not going to be exhaustive today, but to turn our

because I think there is a bit of a connection between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=190s">00:03:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the first

today's day and age, these words are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=201s">00:03:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">very diluted, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=203s">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The word commit is pledge, devote, or dedicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=207s">00:03:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what that word means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=209s">00:03:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a strong word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=210s">00:03:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">When we say we're committing to something, it's not just say like, "I'm just thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=215s">00:03:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=216s">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You're saying, "I'm kind of putting myself in this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=220s">00:03:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And secondly, that word devotion is, I think, even stronger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=224s">00:03:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Love, loyalty, enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/372247477#t=228s">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that has this idea of fidelity, of faithfulness, of allegiance, of this idea</span></div><div
