So, Rachel Click, Hope Green, we'll come together.  Heroes love, rest as the ocean.  Okay, so for the sake of time, for "As the Deer," arrangement-wise, we're going to go from verse one straight to verse two. So, same as "His Mercy is Born," we're going to go from verse one to verse two. What key is this one in? This one's in C, I believe. Cool. So, we're going to do verse one to verse two, and then chorus, verse three, chorus, chorus. Okay? Okay.  And then we'll just practice verse one, verse two, one chorus.      One more time, chorus.   Joe, could you turn me up on the monitor, the acoustic?   Okay, last song, "Living Hope," in B. So, standard intro, G, C, G, C. Verse one, verse two. Chorus, chorus, right? We sing the chorus twice. Verse one, verse two, chorus, chorus. And then verse three, verse three, chorus, chorus. For the ending, I think I sing it slightly different because "Fill With Hope" goes really high. So, I think I do the...   All the way.        So, I think he does the, "Oh God," he goes up. I just go down.  That's what he does.  Okay, let's do it real quick. So, Rachel, you start.  How great the chasm that lay between us. How high the mountain I could not climb. In desperation, I turned to heaven. And spoke your name into the night. Then through the darkness, your loving kindness Tore through the shadows of my soul. The work is finished, the end is written. Jesus Christ, my living hope. You're my living hope. Who could imagine so great a mercy? What heart could fathom such boundless grace? The God of ages, steps down from glory To wear my sin and bear my shame. The cross has spoken, I am forgiven. The King of kings calls me his own. Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. There's salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Praise the one who set me free. Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on me. You have broken every chain. There's salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my living hope. That came the morning that sealed the promise. Your buried body began to break. It's too slow, it drags. Too slow? That's what Rich says. Huh? He says it's too slow. I'll try to listen to Rich because I can't see him visually. Follow Rich. Okay. I will. I turned around to look at you but I can't see you. Can you hear the kick? So Ashley let's not repeat the chorus, that's my bad. Let's just go ahead with verse one, verse two chorus. We'll just do the chorus once. Can you hear the kick? Can you hear the kick? Can you hear that? Okay. Okay. Then came the morning that sealed the world. Your buried body began to breathe.

We're playing the full verse instrumentally, and then I'm going back into the chorus. But I mean, we can hold it too, that's fine too. Instead of going to the chorus, should we go to verse three? That's like the setup for after verse three anyways. Instead of the chorus, should we go to verse three? I don't know, I feel like the song's really long. Instead of the chorus? Yeah. Let me think. (gentle music) 'Cause we just played the whole verse. That's true, okay, let's just, I'm gonna hold the D then, and then we'll go to verse three. Okay. All right, so we're gonna do verse one, verse two. So verse one, turn around, verse two, chorus, and then the full turnaround of, play through the verse, and then we're gonna hold and then go into verse three. Okay? So Richard, after verse three, after verse three, that's when we do a solo for you. Okay? So let's try that part real fast. Okay, hey, let's play through the verse into verse three.
