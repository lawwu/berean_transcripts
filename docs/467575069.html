href="https://www.vimeo.com/467575069#t=252s">00:04:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last part of it was faith is powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/467575069#t=282s">00:04:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was played out in the lives of these
