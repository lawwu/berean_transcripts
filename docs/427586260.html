href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=198s">00:03:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we recall, there were some really emphatic commands for us to abide by.</span></div><div class="c"><span

are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=208s">00:03:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">broad categorical commands, right?</span></div><div

emphasized to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=221s">00:03:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">us, then to walk in love, patience and humility, and pursuing unity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=227s">00:03:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more, to imitate God as children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=230s">00:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Then again, to walk in love, and then also to make sure that we're putting off certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=234s">00:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things that were of our former selves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=237s">00:03:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Likewise, categorically tonight, he's going to challenge us, the scripture's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=240s">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge us to walk as children of

three sections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=247s">00:04:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=248s">00:04:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes the sections don't go as clearly, but what I observed were the commands for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=256s">00:04:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">us to not partake, but to walk in the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=260s">00:04:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a repeated command, essentially saying the same thing, but giving a different rationale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=265s">00:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">saying don't partake, but rather expose it in the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=268s">00:04:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then verse 14, giving us a gospel call to wake up as the light of Christ shines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=275s">00:04:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we take a look at our passage, I do want to highlight that there is such a flow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=281s">00:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of thought that continued from the beginning of chapter five into this section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=286s">00:04:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll notice as I highlight these key terms where it says, therefore do this, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=291s">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">more specifically here, therefore don't do this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=294s">00:04:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">To not be partakers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=296s">00:04:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it says for your formerly darkness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=299s">00:04:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's more in verse nine, for the fruit of light consists of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=303s">00:05:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in verse 12, for it is disgraceful even to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=307s">00:05:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I observed and noticed within that portion was that within the context, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=314s">00:05:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are commands and there are rationales.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=317s">00:05:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Commands and rationales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=318s">00:05:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So by way of observation, I want to highlight those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/427586260#t=322s">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's first talk about the command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
