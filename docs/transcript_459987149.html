My name is Pastor Nate. I'm the college pastor here at this church. This is our building. This is where we meet for Sunday worship, Friday night Bible studies, fellowship events are sometimes taking place here. And this is the central gathering place for our church. Okay, this is the inside of our sanctuary. Right here is where we gather together every Friday night to do our Bible studies. Bible study is exactly what it sounds like. It's a study of the Bible. We come together to understand what God has to say to us, rather than us trying to take meaning out of the text based upon our own thinking. Now we do have both options here of virtual and physical, especially because of this time period during the pandemic. About half our student body is physically going to be with us, half of us are going to be joining through our Facebook Live on Friday nights as well. Beyond that, the only thing you need to know is that we are studying the book of 1 Corinthians. It's been an exciting time, so we would like you to come and join us during the school year.
