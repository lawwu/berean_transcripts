To come that close to something, you know, in the minds of the world, and probably you and I can probably relate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=135s">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if you've ever worked so hard for something and then to not to be able to attain it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=141s">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's one thing when you didn't really put your best out there, you know, you kind of slacked off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=146s">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you had a final coming and you waited until the last night to study and then you didn't get a good grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=152s">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You kind of like, I better get my act straight and I better study harder and plan better and be disciplined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=158s">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are those times when you put every effort that you need.

By the time of Christ, they were more privileged than any other nation in the whole world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=201s">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They had more opportunities. They saw the miracles of God. And yet when Christ came, he.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=209s">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Picks them out and he speaks most harshly toward them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=215s">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they had a right to be boasting in in chapter and verse 17, it says you call yourself a Jew and you rely on the law and you boast in God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=224s">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were proud that they had this. They had this special relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=228s">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how can we blame them? If you read the scripture in Hosea chapter 11, one, three and four, there's a description of how God sees his people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=238s">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, when we think of the relationship between God and the nation of Israel, you say you have this mighty God who's overseeing his nation, this king and his subjects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=249s">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the relationship between God and Israel was much more intimate than that. Let me read the passage to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=255s">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hosea 11, one. When Israel was a child, I loved him. And out of Egypt, I called my son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=262s">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse four, I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love to them. I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek and I bent down to feed them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=271s">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you hear that? The description that God gives the nation of Israel is like a father who adores his son and picks him as his rubbing his cheek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=279s">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You ever see a father do that? You know, very intimate scene or a mother. Right. And so in love with the child, they just kind of like just rubbing their cheeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=288s">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. That's not my word. This is God describing his relationship with Israel. In Zechariah chapter two, eight, there's a term that is used that we often use in other contexts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=299s">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually comes from the scripture for thus said the Lord of hosts after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you for he who touches you touches the apple of his eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=310s">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He describes oftentimes about six or seven times the nation of Israel as apple of his eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=316s">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The actual literal translation of this term in Hebrew is the little man in his eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=323s">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the actual translation. Now, if they just translated literally like you are the little man in my eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=329s">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What? Like there's an idol in his eyes. Right. What is he talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=334s">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think if you really understood what he what they're saying in Hebrew, it would it has a more poetic and depth into what it's saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=342s">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To describe someone as a little man in his eyes, meaning that when if I'm looking and gazing at something and I'm constantly engaged, that that person will be reflected in my eye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=353s">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what God is saying, nation of Israel, you are constantly in my eye that I'm watching you. You are always in my care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=361s">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the relationship that the nation of Israel had with with God was a very intimate relation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=368s">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God genuinely loved them. And I think any parent will know, you know, kind of love that God gives us for our children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=375s">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, for those of you who are parents for the first time, you know, it's you're probably amazed how much love you have for your children that you thought this is something that, you know, that you couldn't muster up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=385s">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God gave it to you. Right. But you understand that when God describes his love for the nation of Israel, they weren't just his subjects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=393s">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They weren't just a project. The scripture says God loved them. And how did he love them? How did he express his love to them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=402s">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said he gave them his law. We saw that in Chapter one, that to the Gentiles, the non Israelites, God gave special general revelation, meaning that he left his imprint about his nature and his character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=416s">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, he said, no one is without excuse. God revealed himself to everybody. But to the Gentiles, he gave general revelation, just imprints enough so that we can see who he is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=429s">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But to the nation of Israel, he gave special revelation. He spoke to them his own heart. He gave them details of his plans, of his desires and his love for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=441s">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there are things that I will share up in the pulpit and I will tell you certain things when there are certain things that I would only tell my wife because of a covenant relationship, because of the intimacy that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=451s">00:07:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are certain things that I would share with other people that I would not share with, with, with, with, that I would only share with my wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=458s">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the scripture says that the nation of Israel was loved and had this special covenant relationship with God would give his law to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=468s">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, up to this point, Paul has been making really one point. He says, you know, we, the Gentiles who don't have the law are guilty without the law, but the Jews who have the law are guilty with the law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=480s">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question that a Jew would be asking at the end of this discourse is that what advantage does a Jew have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=487s">00:08:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All this time for hundreds and hundreds of years, they thought they had a special relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=492s">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Paul answers that question in Romans chapter 3. We're going to get to that in a couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=498s">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, what advantage has a Jew, Paul is already thinking that this is probably what they're going to be, they're going to be thinking and asking because of what I've been saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=506s">00:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what advantages does a Jew have? What value is circumcision, this covenant symbol?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=512s">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Much in every way. He said, "To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=518s">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "God expressed His love to the nation of Israel where He spoke things to them. He gave things to them that others didn't have."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=527s">00:08:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, Paul describes this special relationship that Israel has with God in Romans 9, 4-5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=533s">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were, they are Israelites and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, the promises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/145453692#t=543s">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To them belong the patriarchs from the race. According to the flesh is a Christ who is God over all, blessed forever.
