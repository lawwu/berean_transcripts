my wife was running around getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=110s">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all this stuff and then I could see the corner of my eye, there was this guy who was trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=114s">00:01:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to

come to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=135s">00:02:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I said, "Oh, it's a good opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=136s">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know when my wife's going to come

conversation hoping that I can maybe share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=142s">00:02:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the

and I'm trying to sell him Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=148s">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were just kind of having a friendly conversation and found out that he used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=154s">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">attend church and he fell out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=156s">00:02:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked him, you know, "So what caused you to fall?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=158s">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he started to kind of name the reasons why he said, "Well, you know, the Bible was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=161s">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">written by man and, you know, all this stuff was made up by people and we didn't even have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=165s">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible until 500 years later."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=168s">00:02:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I have no idea where he picked up this information, but everything he said was wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=173s">00:02:53.680</a></span> | <span

know, talking points that they pick up either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=178s">00:02:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at a secular university or some book that they read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=181s">00:03:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I started sharing with him, I said, "That's not true at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=184s">00:03:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we actually have manuscript from the very first century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=187s">00:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible was there from the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=189s">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We have records of it being passed down from generation to generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=194s">00:03:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't until the Council of Carthage at 387 that they decided to put the books together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=200s">00:03:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but it wasn't made up at that time."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=201s">00:03:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just sharing this and, you know, he was like, "Oh, okay."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=204s">00:03:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically, usually when we get to this part of the conversation, they'd be, "I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=208s">00:03:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">want to talk to you," but he was trying to sell me the solar panel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=211s">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was trying to be courteous, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=215s">00:03:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so I asked him, "So then if that's not the reason, then what is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=220s">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, is it you just don't believe in it?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=222s">00:03:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=226s">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, like I said, he's trying to be courteous, and so he didn't want me to leave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=230s">00:03:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, I had no intention of leaving, but he didn't want me to leave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371#t=232s">00:03:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Yeah, yeah, but, you know, even though
