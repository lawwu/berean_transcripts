share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=142">00:02:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=144">00:02:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, he's trying to sell me the solar panels and I'm trying to sell him Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=148">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were just kind of having a friendly conversation and found out that he used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=154">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">attend church and he fell out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=156">00:02:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked him, you know, "So what caused you to fall?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=158">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he started to kind of name the reasons why he said, "Well, you know, the Bible was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=161">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">written by man and, you know, all this stuff was made up by people and we didn't even have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=165">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible until 500 years

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=174">00:02:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are very typical liberals, you know, talking points that they pick up either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=178">00:02:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at a secular university or some book that they

all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=184">00:03:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we actually have manuscript from the very first

they decided to put the books together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=200">00:03:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but it wasn't made up at that time."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=201">00:03:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just sharing this and, you know, he was like, "Oh, okay."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=204">00:03:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically, usually when we get to this part of the conversation, they'd be, "I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=208">00:03:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">want to talk to you," but he was trying to sell me the solar panel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=211">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was trying to be

the reason, then what is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/533254371&t=220">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, is it you just don't believe
