the weightiness of what it means to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=156s">00:02:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be called a pastor or an elder

href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=214s">00:03:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you notice how it says all these false things are happening, and one of the things</span></div><div

teachings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=222s">00:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=223s">00:03:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"Therefore, it says, 'The Lord concerned the prophets who were prophesying in my name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=227s">00:03:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Although it was not I who sent them, yet they keep saying,

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=235s">00:03:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously the message that they were continuing to convey was that God is pleased with you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=240s">00:04:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and so the reason why the false prophets are saying these things is because no one wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=245s">00:04:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to hear that God is

again the rebuke first goes to the false prophet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=272s">00:04:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremiah 23, 21,

href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=311s">00:05:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, one of the problems with the shepherds were they were first concerned about themselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/290167892#t=319s">00:05:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">concerned about themselves, their family, their
