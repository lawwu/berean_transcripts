href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=39s">00:00:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this area, because the first five offerings are so foundational to our understanding of</span></div><div

obviously is in chapter 2, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=72s">00:01:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a small portion, maybe a few verses in chapter 6, and then when you get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=78s">00:01:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">peace offering in chapter 3, chapter 7, I think verse 11 through 21, I apologize, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=85s">00:01:25.520</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=93s">00:01:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's some, a little bit more instructions on the peace offering in chapter 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=99s">00:01:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I encourage you guys to take a look at that.</span></div><div

of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=105s">00:01:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on it, okay, because this is all kind of integrated, even if I don't specifically mention chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=110s">00:01:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">7, we are going to be in a few of the verses in chapter 7, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=117s">00:01:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me pray for us and

way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=232s">00:03:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if you were the first recipients of this letter, this is not something that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=238s">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just read in three chapters in one, because basically it's a law book of what you ought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=243s">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to

because there might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=247s">00:04:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">particular word or a phrase that if you

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=288s">00:04:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to touch something, and only these people are to touch something, and this is how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=293s">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">consecrate something, you have to follow it to the letter of

into the significance of this thing, the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=376s">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of the grain

the meaning itself, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=382s">00:06:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">word itself for grain offering is "mina," or "mina" if you want to pronounce it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=390s">00:06:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The word "mina," it's used kind of generically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=395s">00:06:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't specifically refer to the grain offering, but it also refers to both the animal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=400s">00:06:40.920</a></span> | <span

book of Genesis, where we see the story of Cain and Abel, both of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=408s">00:06:48.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=414s">00:06:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So generally speaking, it means, again, it's referring to a particular type of sacrifice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=421s">00:07:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but the word in and of itself, it means tribute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=425s">00:07:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, all of these things are going to help us to understand the meaning behind this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=431s">00:07:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=432s">00:07:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the money paid by a vassal king to his overlord as a mark of his continuing

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=440s">00:07:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the term "mina" would have been understood as a form of tribute given to the Lord as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=445s">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">an acknowledgment of his lordship over them.</span></div><div

but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=452s">00:07:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the word in and of itself is used that way in other parts of

and it's kind of a relationship between somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=463s">00:07:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">superior to

king, let's say it's the king of Syria conquers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=473s">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">other nations, the nation that was conquered has to pay tribute, and so their tribute basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=480s">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span

class="t">So that is the literal meaning of the word, and as we go through it, we're going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=493s">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that the overall meaning of this is very related to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=499s">00:08:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We see that in Deuteronomy 26, 9-10, again a portion of it, "And he brought us into this</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=515s">00:08:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is not directly related to what I said, but again, this is an act of giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=520s">00:08:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tribute to God as first fruits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=524s">00:08:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we think of giving tribute to God, like a lower kingdom to a higher kingdom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=530s">00:08:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">say again to Egypt or whoever conquered, we think of a context where we're forcefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=539s">00:08:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">giving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=541s">00:09:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, even though the word itself is referring to tribute, the idea in this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=546s">00:09:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">offering is more of a dedication, a voluntary

consecration to God, acknowledging Him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=560s">00:09:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as King.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=564s">00:09:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it expressed not only thankfulness, but obedience and willingness to keep the

closest related to, sorry, the burnt offering brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=585s">00:09:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">peace with the Lord, Lord God, and the grain offering was a sign of thankfulness and dedication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=589s">00:09:49.500</a></span>

giving morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=603s">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and night every single day, right?</span></div><div

and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=611s">00:10:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at night, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=613s">00:10:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the burnt offering, what did they burn?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=617s">00:10:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another word for burnt offering, whole offering, and what did it signify?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=625s">00:10:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the overall meaning of the burnt offering?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=634s">00:10:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the most important of all the sacrifices, and that sacrifice had to be made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=640s">00:10:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on a daily basis, and it signified that they could not be in the presence of a holy God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=646s">00:10:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">without the shedding of this blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=649s">00:10:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they needed to do this over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=651s">00:10:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the author of Hebrews says that the sacrifice in the Old Testament were only a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=657s">00:10:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">shadow of the things to come, and that these sacrifices in and

and over and over and over again, where Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=666s">00:11:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">did it once for

burnt offering is whole offering, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=674s">00:11:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of it was sacrificed, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=676s">00:11:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't just a portion, that all of the

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=681s">00:11:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that burnt offering is first sacrificed, and then the grain offering is sacrificed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=686s">00:11:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards, and it's almost always done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=688s">00:11:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the morning, they would begin with a burnt offering,

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=1363s">00:22:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it's not cooked, they get an uncooked flour and oil and they can cook it themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/255620434#t=1368s">00:22:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they could cook it and bring it and leave a
