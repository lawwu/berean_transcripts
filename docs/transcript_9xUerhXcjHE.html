Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery, in the dawning of the King. He, the theme of heaven's praises, roped in frail humanity. In our longing in our darkness, now the light of life has come.</p><p>Look to Christ, look to Christ who condescending, take our flesh to rest of us.

busy week this week Starting from Palm Sunday Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday We had our Passover meal This Friday We had our Good Friday communion service We had our early rise service this morning And now we are going to be celebrating the resurrection of Christ Again it reminds me of Acts chapter 2 It says that the church was filled with awe And they were gathering together daily To celebrate To fellowship To break bread To pray together And so we kind of The culture that we have created in the western church Where this is something that we do on Sunday And then we kind of come And then if it's inconvenient we don't come But in the early church Part of the reason why the church exploded Is because people were so consumed With the things of God And they couldn't have enough And so even though we do this once a year To me it's a week that I look forward to Every year At the end of it There's a lot of people tired There's people who have been working all day yesterday Just cooking and prepping And so there will be lunch after service But at the end of it Ultimately it's not simply Because it's a special week You know of us gathering together For the purpose of the church But at the end of the day It's to remind us and refresh us That what we celebrated this week Is at the center of our lives It's not just something that's important But it is everything And so what we celebrate this morning The resurrection of Christ Hopefully Again if you've been walking with us Through the whole week That it will have a deeper impact on you Than possibly it would have if

from the grave Amen, Lord, you may be seated from the grave We pray this morning as we meditate upon the resurrection of Christ And what it means for us I pray that that hope will become so clear That our hearts, our mind, our lives May be directed and empowered by it May your name be magnified In Jesus' name we pray, amen Just as a text that we read, it says If Christ has not been raised, our faith is futile Everything that you and I are doing every single week Every Bible study Hinges upon the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ If you are a guest here Or maybe even if you've been a Christian And you haven't really meditated on it for a while And the resurrection doesn't seem real Because you've never seen it You've heard it And you believe it But you've never personally seen it And so as a result of that Maybe your faith is weak You know, you just kind of assume it But it doesn't make the impact that it should Or maybe you're here as a guest And you've never encountered this Christ The resurrected Christ And you have a hard time believing it And if that's you You're not alone Because the New Testament account Tells us that even the disciples Had a hard time believing this When Jesus told them that he was going to die And be resurrected And then he was actually crucified They never even went to check Because they couldn't believe it Now you have to remember These are people who are eyewitnesses Of Jesus walking on water He healed the sick He raised Lazarus from the dead And yet When Christ died They thought it was over You ever hear the term You know You're beating a dead horse Beating a dead horse Basically means His hope is gone There's no point in waiting There's no point in seeking It's over And so when Christ was crucified It was done for them And they were completely lost Even when Jesus shows up They couldn't believe their eyes Could that really be How can this be you?</p><p>So Thomas asked Let me see your scar Let me see if this is really you So he had to touch his scars And Jesus had to show him That it was him And then they finally realized Oh my gosh He was resurrected And only in retrospect They look back and say He's been telling us this And it actually happened Well Jesus himself said When people asked him You're claiming some crazy things Prove yourself What are the signs?</p><p>And Jesus says I will leave you a sign of Jonah His death and resurrection I want to give you two quotes From two non-Christians Because I don't want to quote Christians In case you say Of course Christians are going to say that The first one is from Paula Fredrickins Who is a Jewish scholar A well-known Jewish scholar And this is what she says I know in their own terms Talking about the early church What they saw was the raised Jesus That's what they say And then all the historical evidence We have afterward Attest to their conviction That that's what they saw Now obviously Paula was not there But she's looking at all the evidence Of the people that they study In the early church That whether you believe it or not It is clear that they believed it Gerd Ludman Who's actually a known atheist He doesn't even have faith But he's a New Testament scholar And after studying The historical evidence Of Jesus' resurrection This is what he says It says It may be taken as a historical Certain that Peter And the disciples Had experiences After Jesus' death In which Jesus appeared to them As the risen Christ There is no serious New Testament scholar Who refutes That something happened Because when you look at it So many people Gave their lives A radical change Of Jews and Gentiles Who despised each other All of a sudden Started calling each other Brothers and sisters in Christ That would be A crazier story Than if you fell asleep For a few days And woke up and said That the Republicans And the Democrats Became one party Right?</p><p>They reconciled And now they're going to be One party They're going to be united That's much easier To grasp Than the Jews and Gentiles Because Jews and Gentiles Hated each other For thousands of years It wasn't just political It was spiritual But that's what happened You had runaway slaves And slave owners Sit together And call each other Brothers in Christ You had people Who had PhD in religion Sitting and listening To teachings From a tax collector From someone Who's never been educated What happened?</p><p>You notice here The text that we're looking at In 1 Corinthians 15 13 to 19 He's not trying to argue The resurrection of Jesus He's arguing The resurrection of people Of the followers of Jesus Because the resurrection of Jesus Didn't need proof Because the people Who saw the resurrected Christ Existed when this letter Was being written 500 separate people Aside from the disciples Saw Physically The resurrection of Jesus Christ So you notice here He says Of course people are raised If people are not raised And even Jesus wasn't raised Now I don't need to Convince you of that Because there's over 500 people Who are eyewitnesses In fact in the early church So many of them Gave their lives Testing Attesting to this truth That many people Ended up becoming Christians Simply by their testimony How can this many people Go to the grave If this is all a lie If this was just propaganda For their own benefit Clearly they're not benefiting You have people Who are giving their lives Become poverty Who are being thrown out Of synagogues In their homes They're losing their businesses In the hundreds And in the thousands How can they If it is for their own benefit Be doing that So that's why Even the secular scholars When they study The proof of the resurrection It says Well Whether it happened or not We're not sure But one thing we do know Is they believed it Hundreds of people Who are eyewitnesses For sure they believed it So the people Who are trying to refute this Comes up with theories And say Well They clearly saw something Something miraculous Must have happened At least in their sight So maybe it was The twin brother of Jesus As ridiculous as that sounds That's one of the theories That they've been given Another theory They call it swoon theory Where Jesus just kind of fainted He fainted Right He survived the cross And he fainted And then he just got back up And then he started going around And talking about who he is They're all the ridiculous theories That came out Because they don't understand How can somebody come back From the dead But that's exactly What we are here to celebrate And that's exactly What happened 2,000 years ago And that is the reason Why the impact Of the resurrection Has impacted All of mankind Since then And even that Is not refuted Whether you Love Christ Or hate Christ There is no argument That this single event Has shifted The course Of human history What did the resurrection prove?</p><p>Well Number one It tells us Without a shadow of a doubt That what Jesus said About himself is true Romans 1-4 It says Concerning his son Who was born of a descendant Of David According to the flesh Who was declared The son of God With power By the resurrection From the dead He made it very clear Who he was In fact When he asked the disciples Who do you say That I am You are the Christ The son Of the living God He wanted to make sure That they understood Who he was And then he confirmed it Through his death And resurrection That he is the son Of the living God Now why is that So important?</p><p>Outside of the fact That it's like God walked among us The God of the universe Emptied himself And walked among us Great We can celebrate We can sing about that But what is the impact Of that To you and I? The reason why The declaration Of his deity That he is the son of God He is who he says he was Is Is so important It's because Jesus claimed That he had the power Of life And death He had the power Of life And death Imagine today If somebody Came up with a new invention And if you swallow This pill Right That you're going to be able To extend your life For another 50 years Right That man My guess Is probably going to be The richest man On earth People will pay Whatever they have They'll empty Their bank accounts They'll sell their homes Especially if they're At the tarot Of their life To just extend it For another 50 years Because Ever since we are born Ever since we were born Into this world Our core Our core value Our core motivation Is to live Even an infant That is born From the moment That it is born Is looking for milk Who taught him that They come And he's gasping For air And trying to survive Who taught him that It wasn't years Of training He's innately born To live Everything that we do From that moment on Is so that we can have A better life We go to school We work hard You get degrees You make investments You put money away You buy houses Everything that we do So that we can have A better life But Jesus says In John 10 17 to 18 For this reason The father loves me Because I lay down my life So that I may take it again No one No one Has taken it away from me But I lay it down On my own initiative I have authority To lay it down And I have authority To take it up again This commandment I receive from the father He says He is the author of life Now anybody can put it down But he says He has power to raise it up And then in John 5 21 For just as the father Raises the dead And gives him life Even so the son Also gives life To whom he wishes Not only can he Lay his life down And raise it back up But he says He has the power To give that life To anybody His resurrection His declaration of him being The son of God Meant That what he said Was true Now Why do we even Need life Aren't we living Well Romans 5 12 It says Therefore just as Through the one man Sin entered into the world The death Came through sin And so death Spread to all men Because all Sinned All have sinned And fall short Of the glory of God Now We may be physically Living Whether you are Young Whether you are Old We have Biological life But when the Bible Talks about death It's not just The physical It's also the spiritual Romans 5 17 Says For if by the Transgression of one Death reigned Through the one We didn't just Experience death The Bible says That death Reigns So what does it Mean to reign Typically we think Of a king We live in a Democratic republic So we don't We hear stories Or we watch movies About a king But we can get The gist of what That means For a king to reign Is that every part Of his kingdom He's the final say He affects Everything that happens In that king That's what it means For the king to reign But the scripture says Death reigns Over all mankind In other words Everything that you And I experience On this earth This physical earth He said It has something To do with death It has an effect On everything that we do It affects our marriage It affects our family It affects our work It affects our leisure It affects our economy It affects our politics The central thing That affects everything That we do Is not who's in the White house It's not the economic trend It's not what's going To happen with a tariff All of these things Are minor In comparison To what the scripture Said It is sin And death That reigns All these other things Are ramifications Of that Jesus Christ Says He came To deal With that sin I think the Struggle is Often times In our day to day life We don't feel We don't feel The effect Of sin Let me Illustrate this point To you We have five senses Right We have Hearing Smelling Tasting Touching And seeing Out of the five senses If I was to ask you To choose one sense That if you were To get rid of it I can live without it Which one would you choose?</p><p>Anybody would choose sight? Yeah That's typical Right Of the five Which one would you choose? Well According to Staticians Who went and Actually asked people Seventy-eight percent Of the people asked Said that they chose Smell Right So I'm assuming That kind of Representative of this group About 70 Almost 80 percent Smell And the reason why We choose smell Is because If you lose smell No one can tell But you You look the same You sound the same Maybe you I don't know If it's going to Change your vocal Right Sounds But it says No one's going to tell Except you But smell Is directly related To appetite So I said Well what's the big deal I can I can live bland I don't like Spicy things anyway Right It said that smell Is also Somehow related to Understanding danger I don't know How that works Those of you guys Who are Doctors and biologists And researchers You can You can refute that But that's what it said The researchers say Another thing that it does Is Because you lose The sense of smell You lose The sense of hygiene Because you can't Smell yourself Now All of these things Seem minor But is it If you can't Smell yourself You're walking Out of the house And you smell You stink What ramification Does it have Right You're going to Lose some friends You're going to Sit in the church With nobody Around you Right It has Social effects In fact It says The sense of smell Is directly related To how people We relate to One another A sense of connection Affection Is related to The sense of smell So they say That Whatever Whether by an accident Or whether By genetic defect Or whatever It may be They said That 60% Of people Who lose Their smell Have a very Difficult time Connecting with people And it ultimately Leads to depression And isolation Now On the surface We would have Never known that It's only through The studies That people found How important Smell is To community And relating To one another I say all of this Because often times We don't see The direct effect Of sin When we are filled With pride And anger And bitterness How it affects The community How it affects The people around How it affects The relationship That we have We don't think That's what it is We typically think It must be you Because We have a hard time Smelling our own sins But we smell Other people's sins Very clearly We become experts At what other people Are doing That's wrong See when we live Under the reign Of sin It affects Our marriages It affects Our relationship With our children The very things That God has given To us As a gift You know I've officiated Over a hundred weddings I don't know exactly What the number is now But I've never Officiated a single wedding Where there was A single person That came to the altar Kicking and screaming That despite the fact That I don't want I don't want To get married For the glory Of God Right No They're the ones Kicking and screaming To get to the altar They're the ones Fighting with their parents Fighting with everybody else I'm going to get there No matter what I've never officiated A wedding Where either of the party Came kicking and screaming Because it was a gift Because it produces joy And yet Years later Some of the greatest Heartaches In life Comes from This marriage Some of the greatest Pain that you experience Living in this earth Is from that Union You have kids Soon as a kid Comes into the world There's celebration We celebrate their Hundred days You know One year And the whole Community celebrates But some of the Greatest pain In life Comes from Raising children The rebellion Raising another Sinner in their home And then adding Another sinner In their home And some of the Greatest heartaches As parents Come from Your own children As much as we Desire community The scripture says When sin reigns It affects everything Every good thing That God has given us It gets perverted Because of sin Because all mankind Live under the curse Of this sin Sin reigns That's what this Week represents That Christ Left his throne Humbled himself Walked as a Humble servant And then he Took upon That curse Of man On himself On the cross And in his Resurrection He reverses This curse And then promises Us That we will Do the same The Bible tells us That his resurrection Was just the first fruit He didn't just Resurrect so that We can celebrate His resurrection He said He resurrected So that he can Open the path And the door So that we would Also follow In those steps And that's exactly What we want to Get at this morning In 1 Corinthians 15 42-44 He describes What that resurrection One day is going To be like for us He says So also the resurrection Of the dead It is sown A perishable body It is raised An imperishable body It is sown In dishonor It is raised In glory It is sown In weakness It is raised In power It is sown A natural body It is raised In spiritual body If there is A natural body There is also A spiritual body It is not by accident That Paul used The term sown Because sowing Typically refers to What?</p><p>Planting Right? You plant But why What is the purpose Of planting? To get rid of the seed So we don't have To see it anymore Bury it Because typically When we think of If somebody passes away Or dies We bury them And we don't bury them Thinking that something Good is going to come out of it We bury them So that The rotting of their flesh That we don't have to see But it is deliberate That he uses the term Sown Because when you sow something You sow it in the ground In order for something good It's a fruit to come from A plant A tree There's something to come from that So now He's basically sown The word sown Is being used To describe our death Now because of his resurrection We will be sown He says Perishable But we'll be raised Imperishable Right?</p><p>If you go to the supermarket And it says perishable It basically means You have to hurry up And eat it Because it's going to rot If you don't Imperishable means You can just leave it outside It's not going to disappear So when he says Perishable Imperishable Another way to say that Is temporary And eternal Temporary and eternal What we have now Is subject to decay It's temporary It's going to pass And the moment that you are born There's some level of decay That happens Some of us Are further along In this decay Right?</p><p>And we're very aware of it I'm very aware of it Right? I remember In my mid-40s I went to the doctor And I Again You know Those of you who are older May relate We didn't grow up With internet TV turned off At 12 o'clock There's nothing to do Right?</p><p>We didn't have cell phones So if you don't go to sleep There's nothing You're going to be sitting In the dark That's There's not much to do Right? So we played A lot of sports Baseball Football Even hockey You know Well basketball Was my favorite sport Eventually But I remember Going to the doctor And the doctor Looked at my knee And then he said You know You injured your right knee But you never took Good care of it Because I kept on Playing on it And now All the All the cartilages Are loose And so we're going To have to shave That off So there's parts Of my knees That are bone to bone And then at the end Of that he says Is there any treatment It's like no We can just soften The pain But you can't fix it Maybe one day They'll come out With technology Where that can be fixed But right now We don't have it And so I had surgery To shave it off And then the next thing He told me was You can't play basketball anymore Now some of you Don't understand The devastation of that Because if that That was all we did With free time I played probably Three, four times a week At least That's all we did There's no video games Or at least I didn't enjoy Playing video games I wasn't into Watching K-drama You know And I was a youth pastor And then became A college pastor So I was always With young people So I was constantly You know Playing basketball Or softball And then him telling me You can't play basketball Like some of you guys Love golf And say no You can't play golf anymore Right Some of you guys Like running I don't understand you But you can't run anymore Right Because that That was my hobby That's all I did And then say You can't play anymore I remember coming home Only Some of you may understand I just like That's over then That part of my life Is over So I'm very aware Our bodies decay Some of you guys Who are younger May not know But those of you In the Jubilee Right We don't You know We just need to make Eye contact I remember years ago I went to a friend's church Because our church Was so young And my friend's church Was Were a bit older And there were people My age or older And I remember After giving the sermon We would sit And have lunch And the conversation Topic of the conversation Is what medication We were on So I thought I was always The weird one at church Because You know I have so many things That I need to take But I was at that church Thinking You know After two hours And over the weekend Came back It's like Huh I fellowshiped at this church I connected We're very aware That our body Is decaying But when he says It is perishable He's not just Simply talking about The body itself When it says Decaying It means It's temporary Well you and I Experience The good And the bad Is temporary I remember The first time That this struck me Was when my parents Decided to move out To Korea Because they were Having such a hard time Paying bills here And my dad Got some part time job Out in Korea And at least They can survive Over there And this is when I think a year Into my marriage And my parents Packed up their bags To go out to Korea And I knew That our life Was going to be different Because No matter what happened We were always together But the fact that My dad My mom Was going to go out to Korea And they were out there Maybe about seven Eight years During that time Maybe we saw them Maybe three or four times But I remember Taking my dad To the airport Thinking This is it Not that Not that something Tragic was happening But our Stage of life Is changing Even though I was already Outside the house Married But this Close contact with them That stage of my life Is over And I remember Feeling so sad That something That was so precious To me when I was younger That we have to move on Another time I remember When this is hitting When my kids Now they're older When Jeremy My oldest son Was getting married You know A lot of people Cry at weddings That's a strange Place to cry It's a time To celebrate And people are Celebrating You know They're dancing And usually The people Who cry Are the parents From a parent's Perspective I can see why I remember The Thursday Before he got married We're sitting there Thinking and we were All sharing With our family And the brother And sister Was sharing with him And we're praying For him And I remember Sharing from this day on Even though he's Going to be at the church We're going to still See him But we're headed Into a different Stage of life That when From this point on When he gets married On Saturday When he says His family He's going to be Talking about him In diamond We're going to be The extended family We're the extended family I see a lot of parents They would buy Grave sites And they would buy For them Their wife And then their children Not realizing When they get older They're going to buy For their wives And their children We live in this Temporary body And whether We are living With the sadness Of just moving on Decaying Whether it is Friends I know that Just in a recent period There's a lot of you For whatever the reason Suddenly lost your mom Your dad And we had to go To more funerals In the last six months Than I remember In the last five Six years But the sadness That comes from Living in this Perishable body The scripture tells us That we will be buried We will be sown Perishable But one day We will rise Imperishable The sadness Of living In a decaying world Will be gone When he comes First Thessalonians 4 16 to 18 It says For the Lord himself Will descend from heaven With a shout With the voice Of the archangel And with the trumpet Of God The dead in Christ Will rise first Then we who are Alive remain Will be caught up Together with them In the clouds To meet the Lord In the air And so we shall Always be with the Lord Therefore comfort one another With these words We will be with the Lord And we will be with one another For eternity We will be sown perishable But we will be raised Imperishable He said we will be sown In dishonor But raised in glory The word for dishonor Is also translated shame And I think if I mention shame The first place Where that is recorded Is Adam and Eve Adam and Eve Was physically One person God saw Adam And said it was not good For him to be alone He took The ribs From his side His own bones And own flesh And God created Eve So you couldn't be Closer to each other Than Adam and Eve But as soon as sin enters You know what happens These two people Who are literally One person Who became two Decided to hide They made covering Was it all of a sudden They were ashamed Of their body parts Clearly The shame Was not physical But it was spiritual And that's exactly What sin does When sin comes in Automatically There's guilt And shame And when guilt And shame Comes in We end up hiding Every single one of us In this room To some degree To some level We hide And when we hide We isolate In isolation We become lonely And loneliness Turns into Despair So many people Are struggling With depression And at the root Cause of that Is isolation And the scripture Says That we will be Sown in dishonor But we will be Raised In glory Colossians 3 3-4 says For you have died And your life Is hidden with Christ in God When Christ Who is our life Is revealed Then you also Will be revealed With him In glory In glory That in his Presence All the shame Even as Christians Even as Christians Even between husband And wife We are never Fully open We are more open Because we can't Hide from each other And some of the Marriage problems Happens because We can't hide We hid from Everybody else But all of a sudden You have this Relationship Where they see Everything And you're Uncomfortable With the fact That they see Everything So even in a Very good Relationship You're never Fully 100% Open And as a result Of that It causes All kinds of Conflict Because everything That we communicate With each other Comes through A sinful filter Why are you Wearing that Oh you hate me Why do you Judge me I remember Early on As a youth Pastor I was at church And I say Oh that's a nice Dress And the first Thing that I Heard was What about Last week's Dress Do I dress Like a bum Every day Like why Why are you Judging me I said It was a nice Dress Everything that We say Everything we Hear Comes through A sinful Filter Of some Past sin Some hurt Some pain And as a result And as a result Of that It causes All kinds Of isolation And difficulty And he says But when he Comes We'll be Delivered From Shame And we Will be In glory Second Corinthians 3 18 But we All With unveiled Faith Beholding As in a Mirror The glory Of the Lord And being Transformed The same Image From glory To glory Just as From the Lord The Spirit Can you Imagine Imagine The most Intimate Period That you Had with God Every single One of us God opened Our eyes I mean Those of you Who are Believers In Christ It's because Our eyes Were opened Somebody preached The gospel And we saw The glory Of the gospel Of Jesus Christ And we Wanted That And so We repented We turned From this World To follow Christ And so We come Hoping That in Some way In some Small way In big Way That we Would have A greater Glimpse Of that Glory And he Says Everything That you And I Experience Is temporary And it Is like A child The bible Says But when He comes He said We will See his Glory As he Is He says We are Veiled Because we Are still In this Fleshly Body But when He comes And we Have our Resurrected Body That not Only are We going To see His glory As he Is That glory Is going To be Part of Us We're Going To be Glorified With Christ That's Mind Blowing To me I still Remember Very Vividly The first Time I Realized That God Exists And that That God Loves Me Nothing Else Happened It It Wasn't Years Years Of Discipleship It Wasn't Years Of Memorizing Scripture Going To Church Instantaneously The moment I saw A glimpse Of his Glory I was Changed To This Day 42 Years Have Passed To This Day That's The Greatest Event That I Can Possibly Think Of What About Having Your Kiss Of Course Of Course That Was Huge But Compared To The day That I Met Christ And To Think That That Was Just A Glimpse That Was Just A Glimpse Heaven Is Not Heaven Because You're Going To Live In Mansions Or You're Going To Have A Better Knee Or You're Going To Be Taller Or Going To Dunking The Basketball Or Whatever Your Wildest Dreams May Come True Heaven Is Heaven Is Because We Get To See Front Row Seats Of The Glory Of Christ Heaven Is Not Heaven You Can Have All Your Wildest Dreams Come True And Not Have Christ That's Judgment There's No Life There He Says Not Only Will We See God's Glory As He Is He Said We're Going To Participate In That Glory We're Going To Be Sown We're Going To Sown In Dishonor But We Will Be Raised In Glory We're Going To Be Sown In Weakness But Raised In Power We'll Be Sown In Weakness The Arrogance Of Mankind You Go To The Gym And I've Been Trying To Go Back To The Gym And The Gym Is Filled With Two Kinds Of People You Have The Young People Who Are Working Out In Front Of The Mirror Right Because They Want To See The Results And Then You Have The Older People Just Trying To Live A Little Longer And We Try To Avoid The Mirror We Don't Want To See Because We Don't Be Discouraged Right But The Arrogance Of Mankind Especially When We're Young We Don't Realize Our Frailty And I Think The Pandemic In Some Sense Was Good For Mankind Because It Reminded Us Of Our Frailty That Tiny Little Virus That You Can't Even See With Your Eyes That You Need To Have It Magnified A Thousand Times Just To See What That That We Were Afraid Of That Everything Shut Down Because Of That That's How Fragile We Are The Temperature Is A Little Bit Too Hot Temperature Is A Too Cold We Don't Have Enough Oxygen You Don't Eat The Right Food You Don't Move Around There's So Many Things That Can Kill Us We Don't Realize Remember The First Time When You Started Driving How Scared You Were Every Time You Ran A Green Light Is Somebody Going To Come I Can Die And Now You're Like Whatever Because You Got So Comfortable Yeah But That Machine That We Ride I Mean Think About It One Accident One Drunk Guy One Guy Just Forgetting Messing Around On The Phone And Just Running The Red Light And T-boning Us And That's It That's How Fragile Our Life Is You Know A New Term Came About In Our Newer Generation Snowflake Right Snowflake Basically Means You Melt Easily It's Beautiful But Then A Little Bit Of Sunlight And It Withers That's A New Generation Term Our Generation We Call The Pansies Right It's Beautiful But Then Without The Right Sunlight And Care And Water And They Said It Dies Easily Well Guess What The Bible Says We're All Bunch Of Snowflakes We're All Snowflakes We're All Bunch Of Pansies In Isaiah 46 It Says All Flesh Is Like Grass And All Its Loveliness Is Like The Flower Of The Field The Grass Withers The Flowers Faze When The Breath Of The Lord Blows Upon It Surely The People Are Grass The Arrogance Of Mankind Is Somehow We Can Exist On Our Own If We Just Work Harder If We Get Sick We Get The Right Medicine We Go To The Doctor If We Just Work Out And Take The Right Medication And I Figured Out How To Live Not Realizing How Fragile We Are James 4 14 It Says Our Life Is Like A Mist A Mist That's Even Weaker Than A Snowflake That's Even Weaker Than A Pansy We're Just A Mist So A Mist That Is Proud Think About The Ridiculousness Of That A Pansy A Snowflake A Mist Who Somehow Has Confidence That I Figured This Out He Said We Will Be Sown In Weakness But We're Going To Be Raised One Day In Power The Power Is Not Within Us In Philippians 3 10 11 It Says That I May Know Him And The Power Of His Resurrection And The Fellowship Of His Sufferings Being Conformed To His Death In Order That I May Attained To The Resurrection From The Dead The Power Is A Union With Christ In His Resurrection That Even When We Die We Live Everything Else Is Human Arrogance We Will Be Sown In Weakness But We Will Be Raised In Power And Finally He Says We Will Be Sown In Natural Body But Raised In Spiritual Body The Bible Uses The Term Natural Body Often To Refer To The Fallen Man And The Spiritual Man The Natural Man Does Not Accept The Things Of The Spirit Of God For They Are Foolishness To Him And He Cannot Understand Them Because They Are Spiritually Appraised But He Who Is Spiritually Appraised Appraises All Things Yet He Himself Is Appraised By No One In Other words It Says The Natural Man Has A Hard Time Understanding God In His Sin Because Of His Flesh Because Of His Weakness Even The Word Of God Comes Through The Filter Of My Sin And Arrogance And Pride So Even What We Think Clearly Is Is Blue Isn't Blue And He Says The Reason Why That Is Because Our Natural Man Is So Strong Not Realizing How Weak We Are 1st Corinthians 13 12 For Now We See In A Mirror Dimly But Then Face To Face Now I Know In Part But Then I Will Know Fully Just As I Also Have Been Fully Known We Will Be Sown In Our Natural Body But We Will Be Raised In Our Spiritual Body Imperishable In Power In Glory In Our Eternal State That's Why The Scripture Says Do Not Invest In Temporary Things Do Not Invest In Temporary Things You Work So Hard So You Can Have A Retirement You Work So Hard So You Can Live In That House You Work So Hard So You Can Have Some Security All Of That Is Not Going To Fade That That's All Pansy Stuff To Fix Your Eyes Upon Christ Where The True Reward Is Christ Is The Reward Our Union With Christ Is The Reward He Is Not Just Source Of Salvation He Is Our Salvation He Is Heaven He Is Peace He Is Life And The Resurrection Guarantees That One Day We Will Be United Permanently With Him In Glory And We Will Be In That State For Eternity And All That We Experience Here Is Going To Be A Distant Memory A Distant Memory That That That That That That Is Where We Are Headed I Pray That This Day Of Resurrection Is Not Just Something That We Study Say Oh Okay That Is What The Resurrection So What Does The Word The Resurrection Mean What Does The Burial Mean So What So What You Have Knowledge So What What Is Your Testimony What Is Your Tell How Did The Power Of The Resurrection Change You How Did The Power Of The Resurrection Change The Way You Raise Your Kids How Did The Power Resurrection Change The Way You Saw Eternity How Did The Power The Resurrection Change The Way You Saw Your Finance We're Just Passing Through We're Just Passing Through And As We Celebrate And Remember The Resurrection Of Christ I Pray That We Will Be Filled With Hope That One Day We Will Be There Too Let Me Conclude With Reading Revelations 21 Three To Four It Says And I Heard A Loud Voice From The Throne Saying Behold The Tabernacle Of God Is Among Men And He Will Dwell Among Them And They Shall Be His People And God Himself Will Be Among Them And He Will Wipe Away Every Tear From Their Eyes And There Will Be No Longer Be Any Death There Will No Longer Be Any Mourning Or Crying Or Pain The First Things Have Passed Away Let's Pray Father We Pray For A Greater Vision Of What We Have In Christ As You Remember And Celebrate The Resurrection That We Would Reorient Our Thoughts For God To The Day That We Ourselves Will Be Resurrected That Though We Are Sown With The Things That Are Temporary That We Would Be Raised Imperishable Though We Will Be Sown In Dishonor That We Will Be Raised In Glory Though We Will Be Sown In Weakness That We Be Raised In Power And Though We Were Sown The Natural Body That We Will Be Raised With Our Spiritual Body Help us Lord God To Eagerly Wait For That Resurrection That All Our Values All Our Hopes All Our Dreams May Be Placed Upon Christ And Christ Alone In Jesus Name We Pray Amen Let's All Stand up For The Closing Praise In Christ Alone My Hope Is Found Is My Light My Strength My Song This Cornerstone This Solid Ground Firm Through The Fiercest Drought And Storm What Hides The Love What Ducks The Peace When Fears Are Stilled When Striving Seat My My Comforter My All In All Here In The Love Of Christ I Stand For The Christ So Who Tuck On Flesh Full Is A God In Helpless Faith Is Gave To Love And Righteousness Stored By The One He Came To Save Till On The Christ Jesus Died The Welf Of Christ Was Satisfied For Every Sin On Him Was Play Here In The Death Of Christ I Live As In The Ground His Body Lay Light All The World By Darkness Slain Then Bursting For In Glorious Days Up From The Grave He Rose Again And As He Stands In Victory Sin's Curse Has Lost Its Grip On Me For I Am Him And He Is Mine But With The Precious Blood Of Christ guitar solo guitar solo guitar solo Let's pray.</p><p>Romans 6, 5-7 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be like in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin, for he who has died is freed from sin.</p><p>Father, we pray that all that we have celebrated and remembered this week would have lasting effect, Father God, for the rest of this year, rest of our lives. Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, to adore him, to love him, to follow him and obey him, and to worship him.</p><p>May Christ and Christ alone be magnified in our lives. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let us pray. To my mind falling, an empty grave is there to fill my Savior lives. Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. Because He lives, all fear is gone. Because I know, He holds the future.</p><p>And life is worth the living, just because He lives. And stormy gale, my anchor holds way.</p></div></body></html>
