to what it means to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=37s">00:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not one of many things that

class="t">And that's how he concluded the text, concluded his message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=56s">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the next chapter and a half, what is he going to talk about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=59s">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">Well for the next chapter and a half, he's going to be explaining about his own ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=68s">00:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why he wrote what he wrote, what his intentions are, and he basically is going to be giving an exposition of his ministry itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=78s">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically we would think that somebody would begin the letter like that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=82s">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They begin the letter and say, "This is why I'm writing to you, and this is how I'm going to speak to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=85s">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is what I'm going to say," and then he would say it, but Paul says it at the end of his letter, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=89s">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have to be careful that we don't read the last chapter and a half thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=94s">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"It's a postscript, and he's just saying bye, so we don't need to pay much close attention."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=98s">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in fact, what Paul says in the last chapter and a half really reveals the application in his own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=107s">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The application of everything that Paul has been teaching and encouraging the churches to practice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=114s">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a revelation of Paul himself practicing it in his own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=118s">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm going to start today is going to go on, obviously, for maybe a couple of months, describing Paul's ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=126s">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in particular, verse 14 through 21 is a defense of Paul's ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=132s">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did he write this letter? How did he write it? Why is he doing what he is doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=136s">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, there's about four or five things that he mentions in this text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=141s">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought we were going to take two weeks, but it's going to take at least three weeks to get through this text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=145s">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully you guys can follow along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=148s">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to read a quote from J.I.

href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2341s">00:39:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would play anywhere from 1 p.m. to sometimes 8 o'clock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2347s">00:39:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we played like crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2350s">00:39:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one of the reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2351s">00:39:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we attracted all these guys who were interested in sports,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2366s">00:39:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would see them around the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2378s">00:39:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they were coming to church, so it was growing in number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2382s">00:39:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on the surface, it looked like, "Wow, great things are happening in church,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2386s">00:39:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but then the more I looked into the church, it wasn't real fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2392s">00:39:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I wasn't satisfied with that is because I grew up--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2396s">00:39:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a third-generation pastor in our

me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/281196203#t=2437s">00:40:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that it looked great on the surface, but behind the
