diagnosed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=60s">00:01:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with cancer and we were also living with my grandmother

dark year for me and eventually led to self harm and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=70s">00:01:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">negative thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=72s">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And after struggling with these thoughts for a year, I was so tired that it led me to pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=77s">00:01:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, God, I don't care if

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=84s">00:01:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Gradually after that night, the self harming stopped and I prepared for the move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=89s">00:01:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in grade 10, I moved back to this old but new city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=92s">00:01:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's when God started softening my heart and gave me the desire to go to church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=97s">00:01:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked my mom to see if there was a church near our house and I started attending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=101s">00:01:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">My parents still weren't going to church at this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=103s">00:01:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd walk to and from church every Sunday and Fridays for youth group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=109s">00:01:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this point, I thought I was able to overcome my struggles because I had a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=113s">00:01:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">personality and I was good at adapting to new situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=118s">00:01:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">After attending this church for a year, I went to one of the youth retreats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=122s">00:02:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is when God revealed to me that it was all him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=125s">00:02:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Until this retreat, I totally forgot about the prayer that I said that one night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=129s">00:02:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was reminded of that prayer and realized my hopefulness, my desire to go to church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=133s">00:02:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it was all God working in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=136s">00:02:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That night is when I learned that God is so real and I repented for even thinking that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=140s">00:02:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the past years I was able to get through on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=143s">00:02:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that he was with me all of those dark nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=146s">00:02:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next few years, I started serving and getting really involved at church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=150s">00:02:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I begged my parents to go on mission trips, but they always said no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=153s">00:02:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They're okay with me going on Sundays, but not spending too much time at church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=159s">00:02:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Eventually I graduated high school and they let me go that summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=162s">00:02:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We went to a small native reserve island and spent our time there supporting the missionaries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=167s">00:02:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and local leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=168s">00:02:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This trip is where God taught me how perfectly sovereign he is because everything we planned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=172s">00:02:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for that trip completely went out the window and our days unfolded as they went.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=178s">00:02:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">During this trip, I learned how I needed the gospel just as much as anyone on that reserve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=184s">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And because I was going to church didn't mean that I was saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=187s">00:03:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">After I came back home, the details of my life started to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=190s">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I grew a desire for the work and I got involved with the campus ministry that following fall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/692872477#t=196s">00:03:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Since then, I've had to take a few more stops before landing in SoCal, but I learned through</span></div><div
