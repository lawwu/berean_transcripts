He gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1368s">00:22:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that people are going through lots of different kinds of trials. The word for various trials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1372s">00:22:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is multi-colored in the Greek. So he knows, just like we experience, for you guys, too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1379s">00:22:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes when things go bad, you know how the ADM goes, when it rains, it pours? Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1384s">00:23:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes it's like multifaceted, coming at different angles, and it's like, "Man, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1387s">00:23:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">when I thought one thing was over." And he describes how, yes, we do experience grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1393s">00:23:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We do experience pain, and yes, it is distressing, but then he also describes how it is for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1401s">00:23:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">little while. This is temporary, right? It's not going to last forever. As a matter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1407s">00:23:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fact, we're hoping in Christ, who is going to bring that day when there is no tear. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1412s">00:23:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lastly, if it's necessary, saying, "Even the suffering, though, it's purposeful." Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1419s">00:23:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, shoot. I totally forgot to use this thing. Okay, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and then bam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1428s">00:23:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bam, bam, bam, bam. Okay. You know what? I don't know if I'm going to use a PowerPoint</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1433s">00:23:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">next time, because I forget about it. Okay. So the reason why I'm describing this to us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1439s">00:23:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is because there's an important question we have to ask, right? When you experience suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1446s">00:24:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when you experience difficulty, and maybe even persecution because of your faith, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1452s">00:24:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that supposed to look then in terms of your response? Right? The reason why I ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1459s">00:24:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that question is because I think sometimes when I ask people, when we talk about suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1463s">00:24:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like they always kind of say, "Oh, I feel like this, but I know I should, and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1467s">00:24:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">know I should," and they almost have to like justify why they feel bad, and they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1471s">00:24:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, but I'm okay." And I'm like, "We don't have to, you know, do that, because truthfully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1479s">00:24:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking in terms of our experience, I mean, like, we don't have to feel like, 'Oh, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1486s">00:24:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm supposed to be happy when I suffer.'" Jesus wept when the people around him were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1491s">00:24:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering. Jesus looked at the entire city, and he was just like stirred in his heart,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1497s">00:24:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and he said, "Oh my gosh, I wish, I wish you were different. I wish that you would be receptive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1504s">00:25:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so I can bring you in like a mother, you know, hen." Remember that? And remember before the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1510s">00:25:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cross he would say, "My soul is troubled within me." He's saying like, "My guts and insides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1517s">00:25:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are being all turned around." Are we not supposed to feel anything? I remember actually listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1522s">00:25:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to a pastor's sermon one time, and he gave this, you know, he was teaching on suffering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1527s">00:25:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he gave this analogy when his child was sick, when he was super young. His child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1531s">00:25:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">had seizures, and he was talking about how they were at the hospital, and his wife was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1535s">00:25:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">losing it. She was just weeping and bawling in the waiting room, and she just couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1538s">00:25:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hold it together. And then he kind of had, he said he had to admonish his wife to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1543s">00:25:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it together because we believe in stronger, better things. And I was like, "Dang." You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1549s">00:25:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">know? I don't know if at that moment I would have been like, "Hey, keep it together because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1553s">00:25:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we're stronger than that," you know? Because the fact of the matter is, in our experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1560s">00:26:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a full gamut of various trials that we go through. And we have a full gamut of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1566s">00:26:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">various experiences. And sometimes they are distressing. Sometimes they are troubling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1571s">00:26:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're incredibly painful. Right? But should we have no tears? Should we have no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1576s">00:26:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like, like working through the questions? No, that is not the case. There is a process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1584s">00:26:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a spiritual fight where we see what we see with our physical eyes, and then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1591s">00:26:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">start to consider, we start to remember, and we start to rehearse what we know. Just yesterday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1597s">00:26:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, Pastor Peter and I were digging dirt with Eugene and stuff over at the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1602s">00:26:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and we just started talking about this. Is it weird if we're like more happy when things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1606s">00:26:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are good and sad when things are bad? And then Pastor Peter brought up a great passage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1611s">00:26:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In the book of James, chapter 1, he says, "Consider it all joy when you face various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1617s">00:26:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trials." Right? Now, on a knee-jerk reaction, it's like, "So you should be happy." No. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1623s">00:27:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Consider." Which means you have to do a work. If some of you guys are frustrated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1629s">00:27:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "I don't know, man. I don't feel that joy when I'm hurt." And it's like, "Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1632s">00:27:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because in order to feel the joy, there's actually work required." And what is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1636s">00:27:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">work? It's a spiritual work. It's a spiritual work of prayer. It's a spiritual work with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1643s">00:27:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">grappling with spiritual truth. It's a spiritual work of considering and remembering. Please</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1650s">00:27:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">turn your Bibles over to Hebrews, chapter 10. Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 32 through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1656s">00:27:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">36. And the author of this book essentially says the same. So, Hebrews 10, verse 32 through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1665s">00:27:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">36. He says, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened, you endured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1672s">00:27:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a great conflict of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1683s">00:28:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and tribulations, and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated. For you showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1688s">00:28:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1694s">00:28:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one. Therefore, do not throw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1699s">00:28:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">away your confidence, which has great reward, for you have need of endurance, so that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1704s">00:28:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised." So, there is a work here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1711s">00:28:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of remembering, of knowing, and looking forward to the reward. Your joy is not simply in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1718s">00:28:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that, like, "Okay, I get to suffer." Because otherwise, later on in the book, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1722s">00:28:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "Why are y'all suffering for doing silly things? If you're gonna suffer, you better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1728s">00:28:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">suffer for good. If you suffer for bad, then God's gonna judge you too." Right? So, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1735s">00:28:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">says here, "Your joy is not found in just the circumstances. Your joy is found when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1739s">00:28:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you are remembering, considering, and engaging in the spiritual battle, spiritual eyes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1745s">00:29:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual faith, versus physical sight as we live." Okay? So, that's verse 6. Took us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1752s">00:29:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about 30 minutes. We've got a bunch more to go. Now, I'm gonna kinda push everything together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1758s">00:29:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">too, so we're not gonna be here too long. Okay? But, let's take a moment to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1763s">00:29:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this, right? There are times when we experience suffering, and then we try. We try really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1770s">00:29:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">hard. We contemplate, we try to remember, and we try to pray. Now, here's an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1778s">00:29:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. A mind prayer is that every single one of us would learn, because if we didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1785s">00:29:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">go through a bunch of suffering already, we're probably gonna go through it in the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1788s">00:29:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? At some point or another, we're gonna go through it. That we would be prepared and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1792s">00:29:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">know to continue to pursue rejoicing and being grateful to Christ, even in the midst of dire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1799s">00:29:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">circumstances. Because, if after going through that process, if after trying to remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1806s">00:30:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if after being counseled and after being instructed and reminded, you find no joy, then that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1813s">00:30:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">an incredibly kind of alarming and concerning place to be. Because in that moment, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1821s">00:30:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is no proof of faith. And that's what we're getting at in the next verse. Let's take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1826s">00:30:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look at verse 7. Okay? Let's take a look at verse 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1834s">00:30:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In verse 7 it says, "So that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1841s">00:30:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1851s">00:30:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Now, if you take a look, just for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1858s">00:30:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the sake of visual effect, typically what I do is, again, I try to diagram and break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1863s">00:31:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">down the phrases. But the way that this kind of, there's a, you know, parenthetical clause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1869s">00:31:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right there. Parenthetical meaning it's just kind of squished into the main sentence. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1874s">00:31:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if we just take a look at the main sentence, it should read, "So that the proof of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1877s">00:31:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">faith may be found to result in praise and glory and honor."

Anytime I see a purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=1890s">00:31:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">clause I always circle that.

Okay?

But in their time, they're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2173s">00:36:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being persecuted. So it's not just simply, "I don't see you." It's, "I see contrary, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2181s">00:36:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I love you. I believe you." Right?

What else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2188s">00:36:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is there in terms of proof of our faith? Yes, Denise?

And so yes, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2406s">00:40:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we're asking God, "Show me.

But he's saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2411s">00:40:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want you to believe even when I'm not showing you."

Right? What's good for us is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2448s">00:40:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being able to have a firm footing when we see it.

But if his answer is by necessity, right? If this is necessary, then God desires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2537s">00:42:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">our faith to be purified.

If you notice in verse 7, he says, "So that the proof of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2556s">00:42:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">faith being more precious than gold, which is perishable even though tested by fire."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2561s">00:42:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says this, "May be found to result in praise, glory, and honor." Praise, glory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2568s">00:42:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and honor. And I wanted you to ask the question, I wanted to ask the question, it's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2572s">00:42:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">simple question. Whose praise, glory, and honor is Apostle Peter talking about? He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2591s">00:43:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">later on, you know, after experiencing all this, there's going to be a result. It's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2597s">00:43:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be praise, it's going to be glory, and honor. Whose praise, glory, and honor is he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2603s">00:43:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about? Correct. Yes. Yes. That's a good question. You know, I mean, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2626s">00:43:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to draw a strict line, because in the end, well if I answer that, then I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2637s">00:43:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">giving you the answer. Tricky, tricky. A lot of things in the Bible, it's not so clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2651s">00:44:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cut. I mean, I'm talking about my sermon would have been proof of your faith, but I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2655s">00:44:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have done it sources of joy, sources of, you know, and then the other way, backwards, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2662s">00:44:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But, so anyway, alright, thanks for ruining my question. I'm just kidding. Well, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2668s">00:44:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think about this a little bit. What naturally, the reason why I ask it is because what naturally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2673s">00:44:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we presume to be exclusively for God. Who else deserves praise, glory, and honor? God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2681s">00:44:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">alone, right? You're taught, like, God alone deserves praise, glory, and honor. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2688s">00:44:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what, that's your knee jerk reaction when you read that passage. So sometimes, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2692s">00:44:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you just read it in cursory, it's like, all this stuff is happening, he causes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2696s">00:44:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to rejoice, and what I'm, God is praised, amen. And you move on. But in this passage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2701s">00:45:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you read that again, and you just kind of realize, like, hmm, that's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2705s">00:45:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He says that this may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2711s">00:45:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jesus Christ, right? What's really interesting about that passage is there's a kind of succession,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2719s">00:45:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't want to show it here, okay? Oh no, I forgot again. Okay, here, praise, glory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2729s">00:45:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and honor. Let's take a look at this. There's a little paragraph there where I have arrows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2737s">00:45:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and there is a sequence of connection, relationships between phrases that I put together, and if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2746s">00:45:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys observe it, you know, see if you guys just see it, some of it's really obvious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2751s">00:45:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and some of it, you know, we kind of gleaning from the passage here. Well, first he begins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2757s">00:45:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with, "You greatly rejoice," right? And then we noticed that he introduced the next part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2763s">00:46:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">by saying, "So that." So he says, "You greatly rejoice, so that the proof of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2769s">00:46:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">faith." The proof of your faith results in, results in what? Glory, praise, glory, honor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2778s">00:46:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Obtaining, as a salvation, as the outcome, salvation of your souls. This whole entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2785s">00:46:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">section is a progressive thought of what faith is doing for you. Is it not? I could phrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2794s">00:46:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this in another way. Why is your faith so great? Because it was in accordance to God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2801s">00:46:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">plan, that by faith you would receive everything He promised you. So when He commends you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2808s">00:46:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He commends you for your faith, because when you have faith, then God accomplishes His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2812s">00:46:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">masterful intent, which is to thoroughly bless you in Christ, simply through faith. And by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2819s">00:46:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">faith, you have all of this. Praise, glory, honor, salvation of your soul. Right? Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2828s">00:47:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to me, that's quite profound. Because God does, interestingly enough, commend us. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2838s">00:47:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">know Jesus Christ, who said, who taught, that for those who serve well, God is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2844s">00:47:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, "Well done, good and faithful servant." We know that God is going to reward, richly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2852s">00:47:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reward, those who continue to give and serve the Lord, especially those who would even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2857s">00:47:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrifice their lives for the Lord. Now let me ask you a question. What does this teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2865s">00:47:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">us about God, who commends genuine faith? And I want you to think about that for a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2873s">00:47:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What does this teach us about God, who so desired to give us the inheritance, who so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2879s">00:47:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">desired to give us the resurrection and being born again, who desired to give us His protection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2885s">00:48:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who desires to give us honor and share His glory with us, simply upon faith. What does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2894s">00:48:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that teach us about our God? Let's jot some of these down. I would say, "My, what a glorious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2905s">00:48:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and unique God." Because He's God. What God gives recognition to His creatures. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2914s">00:48:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">master over a slave has, "Hey, let's have slaves appreciation day. Everybody blow balloons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2920s">00:48:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and let's like start, you know, bring up the, you know, slave of the month or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2924s">00:48:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like that." No. Why? Because they're only doing what they're expected to do. What Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2929s">00:48:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">continues to share His space, His wealth with His servants. Wow, God is unique. And wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2940s">00:49:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">God is generous. Scripture says, you know, when Apostle Paul was preaching to the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2947s">00:49:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of Athens, he was like, "You guys are so silly. You guys put down these altars and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2951s">00:49:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys give your altars food and you guys put all this stuff and you guys make temples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2955s">00:49:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff. God, who is in the heavens, is not served by you." Why? Because He don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2960s">00:49:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">need you. God's not using you. God's not benefiting by your services and your sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2970s">00:49:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But what does that tell us? By Him wanting to give His promises simply upon faith, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/200201646#t=2976s">00:49:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a generous God we have. Right? And what's more, God is truly loving.
