I had some questions that came in. Most of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=10s">00:00:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things are probably going to be addressed just from the regular going over this section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=17s">00:00:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I missed two. We had praise and prayer before we left and then I was gone for a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=26s">00:00:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually it takes me about one or two sessions to jump back in. I forgot what time we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=29s">00:00:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to start. Is this the right time? Am I too early? This is good? Okay. I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=37s">00:00:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to mark that. All right. Okay. So we're looking at verse 13 to 20. So let me pray first and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=44s">00:00:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll jump right in. Heavenly Father, we ask Lord God that you would bless this time. Help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=54s">00:00:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">us to deepen our understanding of Christ and what he has done, who he is, would cause us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=60s">00:01:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord God to deepen our appreciation of what it is that we have and that we would live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=65s">00:01:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">our lives according to the knowledge that we gain. We pray Father that you would bless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=69s">00:01:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this time, bless the fellowship that we have, the conversations, the discussions, may it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=74s">00:01:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">all lead to sanctification of your church. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right. To</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=81s">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">begin, just to kind of again, like each session we want to just give you just some hints or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=87s">00:01:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some guide as to how to study the text. There was some confusion and I'm sure it's hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=92s">00:01:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's cleared up by now. When I asked you guys to take some time to ask the questions, asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=98s">00:01:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a question was not your homework. Asking the question is to get you to study it. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=103s">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully that was clear by now. The reason why I didn't want to give you the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=107s">00:01:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is because part of the study is for you to ask the question. Right? So that you can dig</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=113s">00:01:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and say, "Oh, what's going on here?" So that would lead to you digging and looking for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=117s">00:01:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">observations. Instead of me saying, "Hey, answer these questions," then you just answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=122s">00:02:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it and then finish your thing. So hopefully that's clear by now. So the homework for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=128s">00:02:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">week is actually for you to take those questions that you may have discussed in your group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=133s">00:02:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and do your best to answer it and then come. So if you haven't been doing that, hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=137s">00:02:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that'll clear things up. Okay. And then each session, we're not just going to give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=141s">00:02:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some guidelines as to what to look for. And then hopefully that'll help you in doing future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=146s">00:02:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible studies. So the goal of this Bible study is not simply to know the book of Colossians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=151s">00:02:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for me to study and then say, "Hey, here's what this passage means." The real goal for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=155s">00:02:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this is for you to be able to go to your home and take the same principles and study 1 Thessalonians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=162s">00:02:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">on your own. Do quiet time in this manner. So you don't just skim through the book and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=167s">00:02:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">then say, "Oh, I understand it." Okay. So a couple of things in your handouts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=174s">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It begins with, I asked three things or three things to look for. One is where are the paragraph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=181s">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">breaks in this session, in this text, verse 13 to 17 or 20. Within the paragraph breaks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=190s">00:03:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the specific thoughts or teachings within each division? Meaning once you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=196s">00:03:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the bigger picture in the 20 verses, go in deeply and don't end with just a division</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=202s">00:03:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of these groups. But within that, what are the thoughts? What are the arguments that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=207s">00:03:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are being made? And one of the things that will help you to do that is asking what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=211s">00:03:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the key words? I saw Pastor Mark's teaching and he kind of covered a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=215s">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this last time. But again, we want to help you to do that. So we're going to jump right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=219s">00:03:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in and we're going to look at the fourfold division, okay? At least that I found, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=225s">00:03:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I broke up. If you look at the second sheet, basically what I did was I copied the verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=232s">00:03:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">on the sheet and I broke it down for you in thoughts, okay? Remember I told you that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=238s">00:03:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is what I do whenever I do quiet time or when I'm preparing for a sermon and I want to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=242s">00:04:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the thought flow of the author, I break it down into thoughts, right? So this is Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=248s">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. He died for us. He came back from the dead. And so breaking it down like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=252s">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">helps me to see the thought flow of the author. And so I did that for you here, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=257s">00:04:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever there's a comma or and or therefore, I put it in a separate line just so that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=262s">00:04:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can see the different thought flow. So, and I also gave you this because I want you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=267s">00:04:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">take your notes on this, right? You're going to be taking some notes on this and this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=272s">00:04:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just a general outline. So I gave you some space for that. But I also want you, as I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=276s">00:04:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going through the text and I want you to highlight where the insights are coming from. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=282s">00:04:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">most of the things that I'm going to be saying are things because we sat, I sat there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=287s">00:04:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and just combed through the text. It's not because of some Greek exegesis. It's not because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=292s">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw this in a commentary or it's not because of seminary education. Anybody who picks up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=296s">00:04:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible and starts to ask questions and take time to dig, you should be able to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=301s">00:05:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up with these same insights. So I'm going to show you, okay, these are some of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=305s">00:05:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've observed and hopefully if you've done your study and and taken plenty of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=311s">00:05:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to comb through the text, you'll probably see like, oh, I saw the same thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=317s">00:05:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Again majority of these things that I'm going to be saying is not coming from any commentary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=322s">00:05:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just from observation coming from here. Okay. Some of the questions that you ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=326s">00:05:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, it'll be helpful to know this information before. All right. If you look at verse 13</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=333s">00:05:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to 20, okay, and I'm not going to do this, ask you to do this now, but there are clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=338s">00:05:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">breaks. If I was to give a sermon on these verses, it'd be probably a four-part sermon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=345s">00:05:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's clearly four separate thoughts that are tied together, but then it's given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=352s">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in four-paragraph form. So the first paragraph is found in verse 13 and 14. So that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=363s">00:06:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">first paragraph and that basically is, okay, I'm going to write it here, "who Jesus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=376s">00:06:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to us." Again, I'm just using my words, okay, that's what I observed. Second thought flow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=386s">00:06:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I see in verse 15 to 17. Number two, "who Jesus is in light of creation." Okay. Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=409s">00:06:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">did it move? All right. The third one is verse 18 along. Getting uglier and uglier as I go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=424s">00:07:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, you know what I mean. Okay. "Who Jesus is in light of creation." Okay. You can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=447s">00:07:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">read it? Oh, sorry. Light of the church. And then the fourth paragraph, "who Jesus is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=466s">00:07:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">light of the Father." So if I was to give, if I was preaching through the book of Colossians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=475s">00:07:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that would kind of be the breakdown of the thought flow, right? It's Christology broken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=481s">00:08:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">up into four parts. Who Jesus is in relation to us, what did he do for us? Who Jesus is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=488s">00:08:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in relation to creation, right? He's the creator, he's the sustainer, all things are created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=492s">00:08:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by him and for him. Who is Jesus in relation to the church? And then who is Jesus in relation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=498s">00:08:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Father? All of it Christology, but in four separate parts. Okay. Again, the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=504s">00:08:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">why we do that is because you understand the thought flow of the author. It'll help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=509s">00:08:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand the details a little bit better because you'll see where the thought flow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=513s">00:08:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fits. Okay. So that's the broad outline. So, and I gave on this sheet, you know, four and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=524s">00:08:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then each one has the separate title so you don't have to write it down. So if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=527s">00:08:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to take notes, you can take the notes here and make sure that you're making notes as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=532s">00:08:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we go here. So the first thing that we see in verse 13 and 14, so you want to take it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=539s">00:08:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">section by section, right? So the first section, verse 13 and 14, who is Jesus in relation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=544s">00:09:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to us? And it talks about redemption. So in redemption, he mentions how he rescued us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=551s">00:09:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">transferred us, and redeemed us, right? These are all very important words that describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=557s">00:09:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">our salvation. So he rescued us from what? Domain of darkness. So natural question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=565s">00:09:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the domain of darkness? Who's in charge of this darkness? What created this darkness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=570s">00:09:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">These are a lot of the questions that would come up in that. So scripture clearly says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=574s">00:09:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in Luke chapter 22, 53, that the God of this age is Satan, that domain of darkness is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=580s">00:09:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">who has the power over the domain of darkness? Satan, right? So when he said that, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=585s">00:09:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">found in Luke chapter 22, 53. So he rescued us from the domain of darkness. So the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=591s">00:09:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he describes us in our salvation as we were in bondage, in slavery, by the power of Satan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=600s">00:10:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">whether we recognize that or not, right? He transferred us, right? He transferred us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=611s">00:10:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the kingdom of his beloved son. Now this is a very important word, right? He didn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=617s">00:10:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rescue us from the domain of darkness. If your view of salvation ends with rescue from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=623s">00:10:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the power of sin, right? We're no longer under Satan's control. And that's where a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=629s">00:10:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians end up kind of in this in-between world where we are safe from the penalty of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=635s">00:10:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">our sin, but now we're waiting to get to heaven so that we can enjoy heaven for eternity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=639s">00:10:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible describes salvation as being rescued and being transferred from domain of darkness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=647s">00:10:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to the kingship of Christ. And that's why in our church we read the book Lordship Salvation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=653s">00:10:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that's not the title of the book. Gospel according to Jesus, right? Which describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=660s">00:11:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Lordship Salvation because salvation is removing us from domain of darkness and then transferring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=669s">00:11:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">us to the kingdom. So when you say kingdom, you have a king, right? You have a king, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=675s">00:11:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're under his rule. Okay? So that's the second thing that is described. And then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=680s">00:11:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">said, well, how did he do that? He redeemed us, right? The idea of redemption is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=685s">00:11:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that was worthless, thrown away, and you pay something and you redeem it back, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=691s">00:11:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the idea of redemption. So he rescued us, transferred us. How did he do it? He redeemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=697s">00:11:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">us. And how did he redeem us? Redeemed us from what? For our sins, right? He didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=703s">00:11:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">redeem us from poverty.

But it's the core issue is sin itself. So whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=719s">00:11:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the false gospel, the false gospel promises redemption from all these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=725s">00:12:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that are hardship in life. But the Bible says the redemption happens when he delivers us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=731s">00:12:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from our sins. So when he delivers us from our sin, then people who've been delivered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=735s">00:12:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from sin into the kingship of Christ, then there's a reflection of that in the life of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=742s">00:12:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a believer. He becomes generous. He becomes giving. He becomes gracious. He's concerned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=747s">00:12:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about the poor. He becomes a better father, better mother, better son, better daughter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=752s">00:12:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But these are all byproducts of what happens at the core. But Jesus did not come to save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=757s">00:12:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">us from poverty. Jesus did not come so that we can have an easier life. So all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=762s">00:12:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things are accurate descriptions of what happened to us. Now, how much of this did you understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=769s">00:12:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when you became a Christian? Probably you understood some part of it, right? You became</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=776s">00:12:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">saved. You met Christ. So it was a supernatural encounter. Very few of us went through, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=783s">00:13:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">know, went through like a college of information about our faith and what happened and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=789s">00:13:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">end result of it is, oh, now I believe. Most of us went to a retreat and you heard a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=793s">00:13:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">simple presentation of the gospel that Christ loves you, died for you, he can save you from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=798s">00:13:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your sins. You felt the sin, convicted, and you asked for forgiveness. And all you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=803s">00:13:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that if you ask for forgiveness, God's going to forgive you. Now you're not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=807s">00:13:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be judged, you're going to be in heaven. And that's a very simple understanding of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=811s">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel, but that in and of itself is enough to save you. But after you save, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=817s">00:13:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, what did that mean? Right? So even the Colossians, I don't think the Colossians when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=824s">00:13:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they read this, understood all of this. Like, I already know all this. Paul is revealing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=830s">00:13:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">things about their salvation and about who Jesus is progressively. Because remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=835s">00:13:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this revelation was coming through Apostle Paul, so they didn't have this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=839s">00:13:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">before Paul. All they knew was they encountered Christ and they believed him. So these details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=846s">00:14:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are probably new to them as it is to a lot of us as we're studying. But the more we understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=852s">00:14:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it, it gives light of purpose. I see a lot of Christians, like, you become a Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=859s">00:14:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're looking for purpose, or you're trying to find yourself. It's because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=863s">00:14:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">don't understand your salvation. You got stuck in between two worlds. You got saved from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=869s">00:14:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your sins, but you haven't been delivered into the kingdom. Right? You have, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=874s">00:14:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">don't recognize it. You don't know what happened or what God is expecting. So a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=879s">00:14:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are wandering around looking for the will of God. But the will of God is for you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=884s">00:14:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">be under His will. Right? His will. Not, well I know God's will, but what is God's will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=891s">00:14:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for me? Does He want me to be a doctor? Does He want me to be a lawyer? Does He want me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=895s">00:14:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this and that? All of that has to be subjected to His kingship. Right? So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=900s">00:15:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to look for His specific will for you, independent of His kingdom, you're never going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=907s">00:15:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to find it. Because God already revealed what His will is, to be under His will. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=913s">00:15:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what the purpose of salvation was, is to restore a rebellious people who are refusing to submit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=919s">00:15:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to His kingship, to redeem them back, to transfer them from dominion of darkness into the kingdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=926s">00:15:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of His Son. Right? By forgiving our sins. So that's the first part. Okay? Second part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=932s">00:15:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">who is Jesus in light of creation? He is the image of the invisible God. Icon. Right? Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=942s">00:15:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when He says image, He's not just talking about like, take a picture. Right? You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=950s">00:15:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we take a picture, we take that picture, it's like this is the image of so-and-so. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=956s">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He says He's the image of the invisible God, He's talking about a God that they've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=960s">00:16:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">personally seen. They couldn't see Him. Right? Remember the Bible says, whoever sees God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=966s">00:16:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he will die. He can't be in the presence of this Holy God. So a God who was distant, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=970s">00:16:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they heard of, right? They saw from a distance, they don't know what He looks like. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=976s">00:16:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They only know what He's revealed. Jesus Christ actually came. So that's why when the disciples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=982s">00:16:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">asked only if you would show us the Father, right? Then we would be okay. And then Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=988s">00:16:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">says how long have I been with you and you still don't understand. If you've seen me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=993s">00:16:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you have seen the Father. Right? So this is going to go back later on when it says the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=998s">00:16:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fullness of God dwelt in Jesus, meaning that every part of Jesus was the fullness of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1006s">00:16:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you wanted to see Jesus, you don't go through Jesus to see the Father. Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1010s">00:16:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you've seen Jesus, you've seen the Father. Because He is the image of the Father. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1019s">00:16:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've seen Him, you've seen the Father. That's what this means. Right? He's not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1024s">00:17:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that He's an imprint of Him. He's saying He is Him. So one, so we're talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1031s">00:17:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who is Jesus. One, He's the image of the Father. Two, He's the firstborn of a creation. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1036s">00:17:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people who read this, again, this is one of those things that you have to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1040s">00:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit more digging of context. So again, so that you don't end up in Paris. You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1046s">00:17:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to know what do they mean? Right? What did they mean? So firstborn in our culture, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1053s">00:17:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we say firstborn, secondborn, thirdborn, we exclusively, 100% of the time, we use it chronologically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1061s">00:17:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm firstborn. Right? An only child doesn't say I'm firstborn. You just say I'm only child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1066s">00:17:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because whenever we say firstborn, we mean there's a second or thirdborn. This period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1072s">00:17:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of time when they said firstborn, the word firstborn meant something more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1076s">00:17:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? As an example today, if somebody says He's the baby of our home, it means, it can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1084s">00:18:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mean two things. One is, chronologically, He's the last. Right? But what's the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1089s">00:18:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning behind that? How can somebody be using that word? He's the baby of our home. Hmm?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1096s">00:18:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Depending on the most needy. Okay. I was thinking, I was thinking something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1102s">00:18:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That could be it. That's what the, right? What else could it mean when you say He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1107s">00:18:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the baby? Yes, youngest, chronologically, it could mean that. But what else does it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1114s">00:18:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">mean? He's cherished. Right? I was like, none of you thought of that? What's wrong with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1125s">00:18:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you people? So when you, I'm not saying that that's what it means. I'm saying that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1130s">00:18:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a parent could mean. That's how it could be understood. Oh, He's baby. Right? He's baby</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1136s">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or He's cherished at home. Right? So in the same way, in that culture, when they say they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1141s">00:19:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">firstborn, firstborns naturally receive double portion of all the inheritance. Now, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1147s">00:19:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">second, third, fourthborn, you might look at that and say, well, that's not fair just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1150s">00:19:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because he was born first. The reason why the firstborn was given double the portion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1154s">00:19:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was because he had the responsibility to carry the family line. So if you were Abraham's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1160s">00:19:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">descendant, whatever promises that was made, the firstborn was the one that was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1164s">00:19:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">receive that promise and go down that line. Even if you did not receive the covenant from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1168s">00:19:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God, that family line's name. So 10 generations from now, what happens to the firstborn and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1176s">00:19:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then his firstborn and then his firstborn was going to be the line that's going to connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1180s">00:19:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">back to 10 generations earlier. So they gave him double the portion so that he would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1186s">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">double the chance of being successful because it didn't just mean for him. It meant he had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1192s">00:19:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the responsibility on his shoulder to carry his family line generation to generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1199s">00:19:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that culture, when they said firstborn, it doesn't, it didn't just mean in first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1204s">00:20:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">second, third, right? Chronologically. It meant that there was a special anointing upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1210s">00:20:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">him. So when he says Jesus is the firstborn of creation, he's not talking about chronologically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1216s">00:20:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">He was first and came second and then third. He's saying he's firstborn, meaning that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1221s">00:20:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is a special burden upon him of all the creation. So he, in other words, it's the cult, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1228s">00:20:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">culture at that time would have understood this as he is what? Premier. He is above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1235s">00:20:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He is special of all the creations. Okay. Not necessarily chronological. So when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1241s">00:20:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">says for God to love the world that he gave his only begotten son, right? Okay. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1248s">00:20:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not the verse I was thinking about. Okay. I went somewhere else. Okay. Completely erase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1252s">00:20:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Completely erase that. Okay. So when the Bible talks about him being firstborn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1257s">00:20:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right? In reference to Jesus, not talking about chronologically. So one, he is the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1263s">00:21:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of God, meaning he's God himself. He is firstborn over creation. In other words, he is above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1267s">00:21:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all the creation and then that's exactly what he talks about, right? Starting from verse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1272s">00:21:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">three, "For by him all things were created." Right? Now, he just said he is preeminent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1278s">00:21:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">above all creation and then he explains why. Because he's the creator himself. All things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1286s">00:21:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">were created, all things through him were created, both the heavens and the earth, visible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1291s">00:21:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and invisible, throne and rulers and authorities. So we can sit here and dissect, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1297s">00:21:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">authorities and dominions, visible, invisible. But the point of this section is simply to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1301s">00:21:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">say everything that was created was created by him. Right? Seen, unseen. Heaven, earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1311s">00:21:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All authorities, all dominions, everything that you can possibly think of is under his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1315s">00:21:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">rule. He is preeminent of all creation. He's the firstborn of all creation. Okay? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1321s">00:22:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on his shoulder. All things were created through him and for him. So the purpose, he is God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1334s">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he is preeminent, he's the creator. And not only did he create everything, he said everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1338s">00:22:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was created for him. He didn't create us so that we can enjoy life. He created us for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1346s">00:22:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what purpose? That we would worship him. We weren't created to be worshipped. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1357s">00:22:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think carefully how much of our life is dedicated in desiring to be worshipped. Wanting to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1364s">00:22:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the best basketball player, wanting to be the tallest, the best looking, make the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1369s">00:22:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">money, live in the nicest house, want to be famous, whatever it may be. Even as Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1376s">00:22:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to be the best Christian. I want to memorize the most scripture. I want to evangelize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1381s">00:23:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the most. I want to be the most sacrificial. If we're not careful, even the ambition to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1386s">00:23:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be the best Christian is a, if you're not careful, could be motivated by a desire to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1392s">00:23:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be worshipped within the Christian camp. And that's why Paul calls that out in 1 Corinthians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1398s">00:23:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">13. Even if I give my body to be burned, if I do not have love, it means nothing. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1404s">00:23:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it can be motivated by a selfish, rebellious nature. Even martyrdom for glory. Whose glory?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1412s">00:23:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">His glory or her glory. So he says all things were created by him and ultimately it's for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1419s">00:23:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">him. And then finally he is before all things and in him all things hold together. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1426s">00:23:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only is it about him, the only way that we can even be sustained is if he's the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1432s">00:23:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who sustains us. In other words, all of this in creation, right, summarizes who he is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1439s">00:23:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we say God-centered worship, the moment it's not God-centered, it means absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1444s">00:24:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. We join the rebellion. This is not an option between this church is about God-centeredness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1450s">00:24:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is about the lost. The moment is no longer God-centered, you are part of the rebellion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1457s">00:24:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You're no longer in accord with what the scripture says we are. Right? Even the way we do church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1464s">00:24:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about us. My need, my desire, their need, their desire, right? No. Our desire went astray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1473s">00:24:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we rebelled against God.

We, you know, in our generation we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1488s">00:24:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talk a lot about how homosexuality is sinful, which it is. Absolutely. If there's anybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1493s">00:24:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">who struggles with the theory of that, although the Bible doesn't teach that, absolutely wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1500s">00:25:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible is crystal clear. There is no debate about it. Only reason why there's a debate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1504s">00:25:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is because there's a camp that doesn't want it to be true. But if you subject, objectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1510s">00:25:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">look at it, the Bible is not ambiguous about it. There are some things that could be debated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1514s">00:25:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That is not one of the issues that could be debated.

It's not just homosexual desires. Even the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1534s">00:25:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are not homosexuals have perverted desires. Our desire for fame, money, sex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1541s">00:25:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that has been perverted. So when God forgives us of our sins and he restores us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1547s">00:25:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">back to his kingdom, he's trying to not only restore us back to his kingdom, but even our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1552s">00:25:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">very desires are to be redeemed. And then all of a sudden our desires become redeemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1559s">00:25:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for what he purposed, for his glory. Thirdly, who is Jesus in the light of the church? He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1569s">00:26:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is also the head of the church. Now I want you to watch this. He talks about what he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1578s">00:26:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">did for us. He redeemed us. He talks in detail what he did. And then he talks about creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1583s">00:26:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't say here, but it's assumed. All things were made by him and for him, sustained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1589s">00:26:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">through him. He doesn't say it here, in between here, but it's assumed. Though that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1595s">00:26:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God intended, mankind is in rebellion against God. Right? He doesn't say those words in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1600s">00:26:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">between these words, but we know that. So when he says, and all of a sudden he jumps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1604s">00:26:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to the church, what is the church in this redemptive plan? What creation is doing God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1612s">00:26:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is trying to restore through the church. So the word church basically means a assembly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1619s">00:26:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of called out people. It basically means assembly. This is not a new Christian word that all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1625s">00:27:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of a sudden appeared out of nowhere. The word church was used to describe a sacred assembly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1631s">00:27:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was used during the Greek period to talk about their Congress. When the senators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1638s">00:27:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">would gather together and separate themselves from the common people to gather together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1643s">00:27:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to do a sacred thing to take care of their country, they called that the church. A gathering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1649s">00:27:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of called out people. That same word is used to describe the assembly of Christians. People</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1656s">00:27:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">who have been called out from common, whatever was before, and then gathering together for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1662s">00:27:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a specific purpose. That's the word that is used for the church. Now why does he introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1668s">00:27:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that? Because the purpose of the church is to redeem what was lost in creation through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1675s">00:27:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the church. So he's creating a new people. Right? He's creating a new gathering of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1684s">00:28:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because the gathering of people, what did that lead to in creation? Judgment. Power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1692s">00:28:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of Babel. That's what that was. They gathered together, they assembled together. What did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1695s">00:28:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they do? They would challenge God. So he scatters them. Right? So they all scatter and all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1702s">00:28:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a sudden Jesus Christ comes and he dies on the cross and then those people that he scatters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1706s">00:28:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what does he do? What's the first thing that happens? In Acts chapter 2. Remember in Tower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1715s">00:28:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of Babel they're all speaking and in one language and they're all in unison. What do they use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1721s">00:28:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that for? Rebellion against God. When the second Adam comes in Christ and he establishes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1728s">00:28:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">kingdom in the church, what's the first thing that happens? He gathers all these people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1732s">00:28:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with different languages and then through the speaking of tongues they were speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1736s">00:28:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand each other. So what was happening there? He's reversing the curse of the Babel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1742s">00:29:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the church. That make sense? So he's regrouping what was lost through the church and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1751s">00:29:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">why he says the manifold wisdom of God is being proclaimed through the church because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1756s">00:29:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the church is the catalyst for salvation of the world. He's creating a new people. Now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1763s">00:29:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">why is this so significant? Because the church, you hear more and more people say I love Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1769s">00:29:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I don't love the church. Right? You can't be a Christian if you don't love the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1777s">00:29:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because Jesus is the head of the church. That's just like saying I love your head but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1783s">00:29:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">rest of you I don't want. Right? I want to marry your head. I guess I'm not disconnect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1790s">00:29:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your head from your neck. So when we get married, as weird as that is, that's exactly what people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1799s">00:29:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say because they don't know what they're talking about. You cannot separate the head from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1804s">00:30:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">body. Right? Because the body is God's purpose of salvation. So he says he is the head of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1812s">00:30:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the church. Second, he's the beginning. Meaning he's the one who initiated it. A church did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1822s">00:30:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">not come and all of a sudden she said I'm going to own this. He says I will, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1827s">00:30:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I will, but I will establish my church and the gates of Hades were not forbidden against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1837s">00:30:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So his intent, he says to make disciples of all the nations but what's the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1842s">00:30:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of making disciples? Is to build his church. So making disciples and building his church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1847s">00:30:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are not independent things. Right? This is why the second book that we read is the master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1854s">00:30:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">plan for the church. Because if you don't understand God's intent for the church and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1859s">00:30:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't understand the involvement of the church in our salvation and glorifying God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1864s">00:31:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and worshiping, then again it's like worshiping the head but I don't want the body. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1869s">00:31:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot be connected to Christ if you're not connected to the church. He is the firstborn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1876s">00:31:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from the dead. Right? Now here, again the word firstborn could be used chronologically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1884s">00:31:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when it's talking about Christ, it's talking about his preeminence. Here it's used both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1888s">00:31:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ways. Right? He's a preeminent over all things, the living and the dead. But here when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1894s">00:31:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">says he created the church, he started the church, well how did he do it? He died and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1899s">00:31:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he resurrected. And so he was the first that came back from the dead with a new glorified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1905s">00:31:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">body and he paved the way for all of the other new creation to follow his same path to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1912s">00:31:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a new creation in the church. Does that make sense? What was corrupted and lost in creation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1920s">00:32:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">he reverses the curse through the church, through his death and resurrection, so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1924s">00:32:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he's the first from the dead, he basically kicks the door open that we could not open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1929s">00:32:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because of our sins. And so now when we get baptized, we are baptized, right, in union</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1935s">00:32:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">with his death, but we are also united with him in his resurrected life. So he's the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1940s">00:32:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from the dead and then we will be second, third, fourth, and fifth. So that he himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1947s">00:32:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">will have the first place in everything. So again, back to his intent. The purpose of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1952s">00:32:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this is not simply so that you can be free and then yes, he kicked the door,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1957s">00:32:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we can, we're free to do whatever we want. He said no, the purpose of this is to establish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1962s">00:32:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ as King, because that's what was lost at the fall. Now before I go any further,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1972s">00:32:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, this rubs some people the wrong way. This seems egotistical. Why does he tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1981s">00:33:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">us to humble ourselves and then he keeps saying, you know, glorify him, it's only about him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1986s">00:33:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all about him, everything is about him. First, because it is, because it is, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=1996s">00:33:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the truth. We're not like taking a bunch of different things and say, well we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2000s">00:33:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">going to choose God to be the best. He created us. He has the power of life and death. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2008s">00:33:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if he is not glorified, we die. So think about it, I mentioned this before in sermons many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2017s">00:33:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">times, but if we've been created for the purpose of worship, when we function the way God created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2022s">00:33:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when we experience the greatest life. The greatest, when you experience the greatest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2028s">00:33:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">life is when you see something that you worship. That's why we're idol worshippers. The only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2034s">00:33:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">difference is which idol we worship. Because we were created for the purpose of worship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2041s">00:34:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we worship, when we worship God, there's nothing beyond God. Because every other idol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2050s">00:34:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you worship, something else comes up and that idol looks better and that idol looks better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2054s">00:34:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and you jump from idol to idol to idol, from time to time, generation, circumstance to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2058s">00:34:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">circumstance. But when you become the worshipper of the living God, there is nothing to jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2063s">00:34:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to. Because you're worshipping the highest being. You're worshipping there is nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2070s">00:34:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">greater than that. Right? You worship Kobe, there comes LeBron. I don't know who's up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2079s">00:34:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">after that, Zion. Something's going to come and take its place because eventually it erodes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2085s">00:34:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they're eventually not going to be objects of worship, they're going to disappoint. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2089s">00:34:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when you worship God, it's permanent and it is eternal. And no matter how long we exist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2096s">00:34:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be gazing at God and there's going to be more things to be able to worship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2100s">00:35:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">God for eternity. That's how much his glory is. He doesn't fade, he's immutable for eternity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2108s">00:35:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to be turning around and there's something else to worship that way. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2112s">00:35:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go deeper and deeper and deeper. That's who God is. He's eternal. His glory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2116s">00:35:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is eternal. Right? And so if God created us for that, when we are restored back to worshipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2123s">00:35:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">God, it's not egotistical. When he is glorified, we live.

And if that bothers you, it's because innately you're not a worshipper of God. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2137s">00:35:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">if you are a worshipper of God, you would recognize that that's when you feel the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2141s">00:35:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">alive.

Fourthly, who is Jesus in the light of his father? For it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2156s">00:35:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the father's good pleasure. Right?

There's a fullness to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2161s">00:36:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">dwell in him. So this was another question that came up. Fullness to dwell in him, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2165s">00:36:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't like God didn't give him a portion. He's not just a representative or image of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2170s">00:36:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">his goodness or image of his kindness. All that is about God is in Christ. So we look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2178s">00:36:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">at Christ and say, "Well, he was so gracious he died and the God of the Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2182s">00:36:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the father, is so vengeful because he wiped out the world and Jericho and he did all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2188s">00:36:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that.

And through him to reconcile all things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2223s">00:37:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to himself. That's the goal. Reconciliation is the goal because every problem that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2230s">00:37:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have is because we've fallen away from the author of life.

That's why if you say you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2245s">00:37:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a believer and you have no relationship with Jesus Christ, you have to take a step back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2251s">00:37:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and ask, "Have I been reconciled?" Because that's what it means to be saved, to be reconciled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2260s">00:37:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to the father.

One of the questions that I asked is, where does anxiety come from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2441s">00:40:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Ultimately, ultimately, I'm not saying that you can't be anxious about your finance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2446s">00:40:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">your future, but ultimately anxiety comes from being disconnected with God. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2451s">00:40:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God is sovereign, he's in control. Anxiety comes because you're not, you're uncertain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2455s">00:40:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about the future. You're uncertain about what's going to happen, right? You're uncertain that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2462s">00:41:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you want something and it's not going to happen. But when you believe in a sovereign God who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2465s">00:41:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">loves you, cares for you, who is in control of all things, I'm not saying that we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2470s">00:41:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">struggle with anxiety, but anxiety is not what characterizes your life. When you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2476s">00:41:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">peace with God, God gives you the peace of God. Because you know that whatever happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2482s">00:41:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life is in God's hands. But if you don't believe that, that's where anxiety comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2485s">00:41:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from, because you have no control over what happens tomorrow. If I do this, and what if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2489s">00:41:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't get that? If I do this, and what if I don't receive that? Then what happens in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2494s">00:41:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">my life? If you don't believe in a sovereign God who loves you and has control, he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2500s">00:41:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to send his only son to die for you. How will he not along with him give you all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2505s">00:41:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things? So if you believe in that, all of a sudden God gives you peace. When anxiety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2510s">00:41:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">comes, he's in control. What you meant for evil, God meant for good. So the peace of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2517s">00:41:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">God, right? Peace with God gives you the peace of God. So Christian can feel anxious, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2525s">00:42:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">anxiousness cannot be the primary character of a Christian, if you believe in a sovereign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/315814583#t=2533s">00:42:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">God.
