So Promise Keepers was a ministry that started in 1990 by the head football coach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=119s">00:01:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado, Bill McCartney. And basically the ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=125s">00:02:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">again I've never been to their conference, but the conference started mainly geared toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=130s">00:02:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bringing revival among men. And the reason why they kept making Promise Keepers is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=135s">00:02:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">remind the men of the covenant that they made with their wives. Yesterday we had a wedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=140s">00:02:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with Eugene and Susie and every time you get married, obviously when we have marriages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=145s">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the same covenant that we make, that the husband is going to represent Christ in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=149s">00:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this home. And to love sacrificially to lead her as Christ did to the church. And so it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=157s">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">called the Promise Keepers, again it's to challenge the men to lead in their homes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=161s">00:02:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">To keep the promise that they made at the altar. It was a huge movement. I believe it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=167s">00:02:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">still going on today.

And it was a big movement. Especially early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=176s">00:02:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on you heard about Promise Keepers everywhere in Los Angeles, Orange County, in every segment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=180s">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of United States and even outside the United States because there was a tremendous need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=186s">00:03:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to challenge, especially the men, to act like men. To keep the promises. I mean think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=193s">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in our generation, how many people you can think of that say, "That guy makes a promise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=198s">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he keeps it. His word is basically, you can bank on it." I think today in our generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=209s">00:03:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to find people who are really true to their word, again it's becoming more and more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=215s">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a difficult reality. In fact today, when people make promises, and again the older you get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=220s">00:03:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you get jaded with promises of people because you get so disappointed. Typically when people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=225s">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">make promises, when you're younger you get excited when people promise certain things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=230s">00:03:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but the older you get you're just kind of like, "Okay, we'll see." You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=234s">00:03:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like everything, we say, "Yeah, we'll see." Because we get disappointed by people. See,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=241s">00:04:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">question that comes up in this text in chapter 3 is related to this idea of keeping promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=247s">00:04:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why is because Paul's been telling the Jews in the first two chapters, "You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=252s">00:04:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">no different than the Gentiles." Think about it, for hundreds of years, that's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=256s">00:04:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what they thought. They thought they were completely different than the Gentiles because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=261s">00:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they were God's chosen people. And God continually reminds them over and over again that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=267s">00:04:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are not like other nations. God tells them, if you go into the Promised Land, do not intermarry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=272s">00:04:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with them because you are a chosen generation. You're a holy nation, right? You're a royal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=278s">00:04:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">priesthood. But all of a sudden, Paul, in presenting the Gospel, setting the foundation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=285s">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he's saying, "No, Gentiles are Jews and Jews are no different." So last week, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=290s">00:04:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">question that came up was, "If that's the case, then what is the benefit of being a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=294s">00:04:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Jew?" What is the benefit? So that's the first question that came up. And the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=299s">00:04:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that he says, "Of course, in every way. How can you possibly even ask that question?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=303s">00:05:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "Of all the benefits that you have, first and foremost, you have the Word of God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=310s">00:05:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God gave His general revelation, left His imprint in creation. But to you, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=315s">00:05:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">special revelation. God drew near and spoke to you and gave you the specifics of His redemptive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=321s">00:05:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">plan. So this is a follow-up question from that, that if that's the case, if God is faithful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=329s">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to Himself, right, and we are no different, and we just have the Law of God, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=335s">00:05:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the only difference between us and the Gentiles, the follow-up question to that is, what if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=340s">00:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some were unfaithful? Meaning that if, because of the unfaithfulness of the Jews, does their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=344s">00:05:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? That's basically what they're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=351s">00:05:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is all these years we've been told that God made a covenant with our forefathers, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=358s">00:05:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And for generations to come, to David, to Solomon, God made a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=364s">00:06:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">covenant that He was going to remain faithful to the nation of Israel. Now you're telling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=369s">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">me that we're no different. If a Jew died in his state, that he would stand before a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=375s">00:06:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">God and be judged the same way as a Gentile. So if that's the case, because of the faithlessness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=383s">00:06:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Jews, does that mean that God will become faithless? That He will nullify His</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=388s">00:06:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">covenant that He made with us? Well, He deals with this question in a more elaborate way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=395s">00:06:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in 1st chapter 9, 10, and 11. So He's going to spend three chapters basically expounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=401s">00:06:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this idea, trying to answer this question. So today He's just going to answer it in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=405s">00:06:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">couple sentences, and then He's going to leave the bigger dissertation in the next, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=409s">00:06:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we get to chapter 9, 10, and 11. But let me give you a glimpse of the idea that He gives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=414s">00:06:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">In Romans 11, 1 through 2, the same answer is given, same question is given. I asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=419s">00:06:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">him, "Has God rejected His people?" Is He done with Israel? "By no means." Next time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=428s">00:07:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you read the book of Romans and you see that term "by no means," try to circle it or highlight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=433s">00:07:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it because He's using the strongest of a language that He can possibly use to answer this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=440s">00:07:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically what He's saying is, "Of course not. Are you kidding?" That's the way you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=444s">00:07:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really should read in English, right? It seems a lot more gentle, "By no means," right? A</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=449s">00:07:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">lot more civilized. But He's basically saying, "Are you kidding me? By no means, for I myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=457s">00:07:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">am an Israelite." So in other words, saying, "Hey, this guy Paul is coming around and saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=463s">00:07:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">God is done with the nation of Israel." He's basically saying that everything that we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=467s">00:07:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">been standing, we've stood for, for hundreds of years, this guy's nullifying. And He says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=472s">00:07:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, by no means. I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=478s">00:07:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of Benjamin.

How chaotic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1098s">00:18:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the modern day church is, the church growth.

Think about how tempted our God must be knowing how angry He is towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1114s">00:18:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">us.

But the only reason why you and I are here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1120s">00:18:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is because God is faithful to His covenant. It's because He's been faithful that you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1126s">00:18:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I are not consumed. That's exactly what it says in Lamentations 3.22. "Because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1130s">00:18:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for His compassion never fails. They are new every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1136s">00:18:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">morning. Great is your faithfulness." So He said, "Because of the faithlessness of some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1142s">00:19:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">will God nullify the covenant?" He says, "By no means. Of course not. Let every man found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1147s">00:19:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a liar, but God will remain true to Himself. He is faithful." The question that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1154s">00:19:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">comes up with that is, yes, God is faithful. And that's the reason why you and I are here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1158s">00:19:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And that's why having the Word of God is so precious to us. Because we have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1163s">00:19:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">promises. They're not just general revelation. We have special promises of God's covenant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1170s">00:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with His people. And so that's our source of comfort. That's our hope. That's what gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1175s">00:19:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">us strength. That even in the times of trial, we know that God will never change. What He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1180s">00:19:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">says, He will do. And we can bank on it. Even if we can't trust anybody else in this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1187s">00:19:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if we can't trust our own wives or children. He said, "You can bank on the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1192s">00:19:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">God has said." But here comes the next question that comes along with that. Well, if God is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1197s">00:19:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">faithful, you know, typically when we think of the faithfulness of God, we think, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1202s">00:20:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">God is faithful of His mercy.

God is faithful in His compassion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1210s">00:20:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But when we talk about the faithfulness of God, we're not just talking about His mercy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1215s">00:20:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and compassion. We're also talking about His promise of judgment. And that's exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1220s">00:20:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul quotes. Paul quotes Psalm 51, verse 4, in the next passage, when he says that, "You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1225s">00:20:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged." He's quoting a text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1231s">00:20:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">from David's repentance. David repents and he's crying out to God and he said, "You are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1237s">00:20:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just in your judgment." David's life is a perfect example of God's faithfulness to all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1243s">00:20:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of His covenants. God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, an unconditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1249s">00:20:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">covenant that He's going to be faithful to His people. But He also promised them that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1254s">00:20:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you disobey My commandments, judgment will come. As you guys know, David ends up committing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1260s">00:21:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a horrendous sin. And he tries to cover it up. God sends a prophet, exposes him. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1267s">00:21:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">God says, "As a result of your sin, what happens? There will be bloodshed in your family. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1274s">00:21:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your children are going to be divided. Your kingdom is going to be divided in two. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1277s">00:21:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bloodshed will remain in your family." It's in that context where David is crying out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1283s">00:21:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to God. He said, "No, God, You are just." He doesn't stand before God and say, "Lord,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1287s">00:21:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not fair. How come You're not being merciful?" He says, "No, in Your judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1292s">00:21:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You are fair." See, God remained faithful to His covenant that despite David's sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1298s">00:21:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">God remained faithful to the nation of Israel. And He even despite all the sins of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1305s">00:21:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kings that followed David, one after another, through all the false prophets that came into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1310s">00:21:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the nation of Israel, God remained faithful to His people. He never squashed the nation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1315s">00:21:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of Israel and said, "We're done with you. Look at all your leaders." So He was faithful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1321s">00:22:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to His promise of His covenant, but He was also faithful to all the promise of judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1327s">00:22:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that would come upon that nation if they did not follow Him.

And then He also states that, "As you glorify the Son, I glorify the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1527s">00:25:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Father."

In fact, when Jesus came, He started rebuking the Pharisees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1710s">00:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "You know, you guys are obeying all the commandments, and you don't understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1713s">00:28:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the spirit of the Law.

And so He started rebuking them for their Pharisee tendencies. So they said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1721s">00:28:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"You know what?

They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1799s">00:29:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">were having some sort of a Christmas gathering, and that's where he shot up everybody. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1803s">00:30:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they found out that they had a small child. They had a small child, and before the child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1809s">00:30:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">came, the same co-workers that he shot up actually threw him a baby shower. They threw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1816s">00:30:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">him a baby shower. So, after hearing that, I said, "Oh my gosh." You know? I mean, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1821s">00:30:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he did in and of itself was horrendous. But considering that his co-worker, and they say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1827s">00:30:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, we're all very tight-knit group," and it was shocking for all of us that he did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1830s">00:30:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this, especially to the people that he did it. Considering just a few months ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1834s">00:30:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they gathered together and got their money together, and during their break, had a baby</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1838s">00:30:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shower for him. And those are the people that he shot up. So, when we find the details of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1843s">00:30:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the background behind what happened, it makes his horrendous act even that much more horrendous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1850s">00:30:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture tells us that the law came to make sin utterly sinful, to reveal to us just exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1860s">00:31:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what you and I were deserving of. You know, when we first become Christians, we say, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1866s">00:31:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thank God Jesus loved me, and I'm a sinner." But the more we dig, the more we understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1872s">00:31:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the law, the more we understand who God is, the more we come to grips with exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1879s">00:31:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">he did on the cross. You may have at one point said, "Thank God for Jesus. Thank God for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1885s">00:31:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">him on the cross." But the sanctification, part of our spiritual maturity, and why the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1890s">00:31:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">blessing of having the Word of God, is because the Word of God reveals to us just how sinful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1896s">00:31:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we really were. And it is in that backdrop that God's love is displayed. So, when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1904s">00:31:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Scripture says in Romans 5a, God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1908s">00:31:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yet sinners. See, the study of the Scriptures gives us a deeper understanding of what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1915s">00:31:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">means, "yet sinners." It's one thing for us to see, it's like, "Oh yeah, you know, we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1921s">00:32:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what we shouldn't have done.

But it's another thing to understand, just like this man, that the people that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1930s">00:32:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">killed, not only were they his co-workers, but these are the people who poured love into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1934s">00:32:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">their life for their child, just a few months ago. And then you just recognize just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=1940s">00:32:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">utter depravity of his heart to do something like that.

And the last thing he did was he humbled himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2549s">00:42:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and became nothing. Serving them, washing their dirty, filthy feet. He didn't glorify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2557s">00:42:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">himself. He emptied himself, became nothing. And the way he attracted his disciples is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2564s">00:42:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by serving us, by giving us more grace, by giving us more love. So that now when we remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2572s">00:42:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, it is not his fist. It is his love that attracts us. We're compelled by the love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2579s">00:42:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of Christ. And that's what real grace is. That's what gospel-centeredness really ought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2585s">00:43:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to be, is that we are so compelled by this love that we pursue holiness like we've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2592s">00:43:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">done before.

We're gracious like we've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2598s">00:43:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">been gracious before.

Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2605s">00:43:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we are drawn to the love of God like a magnet. And that's his faithfulness. His faithfulness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2613s">00:43:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is that he calls us to holiness by his grace. And if you get any part of that wrong, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2621s">00:43:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">not a movement of God.

That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/148656293#t=2653s">00:44:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to be faithful to everything that he has set an example of.
