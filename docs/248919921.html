href="https://www.vimeo.com/248919921#t=103s">00:01:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We call it the BALT, and the first part of it is our unity in Christ is first and foremost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/248919921#t=109s">00:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">based upon our belief that Christ is the head of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/248919921#t=113s">00:01:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our unity is not uniformity where we just kind of look like each other, we sound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/248919921#t=118s">00:01:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like each other, and we do certain things
