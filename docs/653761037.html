<span class="t">So whenever we go, obviously it's illegal to outright share the gospel with them, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=127">00:02:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to minors, but it's not very hard to share the gospel because all we have to do is share</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=134">00:02:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we would teach about history and various things and about grammar but we would always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=138">00:02:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure that we have one class at American holidays and obviously we would share about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=142">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas.</span></div><div

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=147">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And they say, "Hey, you're not supposed to share the

these years coming in and out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=160">00:02:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of China because it's embedded into this culture, the Judeo-Christian principles and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=166">00:02:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though we may be moving away from it today, it's embedded into the culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=171">00:02:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's one of the benefits of being in a culture where even around us today, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=177">00:02:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so many people practice Christmas, almost the whole world practices Christmas, not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=181">00:03:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding the significance of what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=183">00:03:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we want to take advantage of that, that while we celebrate Christmas, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=188">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to ask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=198">00:03:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the door kind of is open for us to be able to share the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=202">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I share that is because Christmas is probably the most, I don't know if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=208">00:03:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">want to call it important, but the most celebrated, that we make the biggest deal about Christmas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=213">00:03:33.080</a></span> | <span

class="t">Our longest break, holiday break, is during the Christmas break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=221">00:03:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The Jews also had something like Christmas in their culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=226">00:03:46.820</a></span> | <span

Passover, and that Passover would bleed into the Passover through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=242">00:04:02.760</a></span> | <span

weeks and weeks off, sometimes months off, in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=247">00:04:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to travel to

every year they would share this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=255">00:04:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one another and remind each other of the significance of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=259">00:04:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the center of their culture, this Day of Atonement was embedded for a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=266">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span

an altar from which those who serve the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=273">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tabernacle have no right to

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037&t=309">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then verse 11, he said, "For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought
