href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=122s">00:02:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever we go, obviously it's illegal to outright share the gospel with them, especially</span></div><div

share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=132s">00:02:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about American holidays.</span></div><div class="c"><span

always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=138s">00:02:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure that we have one class at American holidays and obviously we would share about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=142s">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Easter, Thanksgiving,

come out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=147s">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And they say, "Hey, you're not supposed to share the gospel."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=149s">00:02:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, "Oh, we're just telling them what Christmas is about."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=152s">00:02:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They say, "You're not supposed to talk about the

these years coming in and out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=160s">00:02:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of China because it's embedded into this culture, the Judeo-Christian principles and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=166s">00:02:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though we may be moving away from it today, it's embedded into the culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=171s">00:02:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's one of the benefits of being in a culture where even around us today, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=177s">00:02:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so many people practice Christmas, almost the whole world practices Christmas, not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=181s">00:03:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding the significance of what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=183s">00:03:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we want to take advantage of that, that while we celebrate Christmas, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=188s">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to ask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=190s">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it may be hard to ask, but do you want to hear about God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=192s">00:03:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But when everybody's celebrating Christmas to say, "This is what Christmas means," right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=198s">00:03:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the door kind of is open for us to be able to share the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=202s">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why I share that is because Christmas is probably the most, I don't know if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=208s">00:03:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">want to call it important, but the most celebrated, that we make the biggest deal about Christmas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=213s">00:03:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You see it in decorations, commercials, everything that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=217s">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Our longest break, holiday break, is during the Christmas break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=221s">00:03:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The Jews also had something like Christmas in their culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=226s">00:03:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they had was the Day of Atonement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=233s">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Day of Atonement was their biggest holiday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=236s">00:03:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So they would have the Passover, and that Passover would bleed into the Passover through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=242s">00:04:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the Day of Atonement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=244s">00:04:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they would take sometimes weeks and weeks off, sometimes months off, in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=247s">00:04:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to travel to get to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=249s">00:04:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was embedded into their culture so that every year they would share this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=255s">00:04:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one another and remind each other of the significance of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=259s">00:04:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the center of their culture, this Day of Atonement was embedded for a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=266s">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span

an altar from which those who serve the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=273s">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tabernacle have no right

priest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=291s">00:04:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=309s">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then verse 11, he said, "For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=313s">00:05:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are

while they were in the desert, obviously God placed a tabernacle in the center</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=389s">00:06:29.200</a></span> |

<span class="t">So at the tabernacle, what was at the center of the tabernacle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=399s">00:06:39.800</a></span> |

through the book of Leviticus, Leviticus is designed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=422s">00:07:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is

understand what God was doing in the book of Leviticus, it really is very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=450s">00:07:30.560</a></span> | <span

the drums or the music getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/653761037#t=478s">00:07:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit louder, or if you're
