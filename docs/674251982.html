just, you know, back then I used to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=179s">00:02:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">songs and write poems,

looking back at it now, only if I knew what was coming, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=190s">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't

because I saw it in my parents, that at least I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=200s">00:03:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some inkling,

guard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=204s">00:03:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't make it like easy, but at least I knew what was coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=209s">00:03:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew what I was getting into.</span></div><div

poem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=219s">00:03:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">30 some years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

persevere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=234s">00:03:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever it is that you're doing, God gives us the strength that we need to persevere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=238s">00:03:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=239s">00:03:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as we were going through this text, obviously we started out by understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=244s">00:04:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the biblical calling of leaders in the church, the very high calling in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=249s">00:04:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we take this very, very seriously, sometimes to the point where people are frustrated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=253s">00:04:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that we need to have a very high view of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=256s">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Doesn't mean that the leadership is perfect, that they don't make mistakes, but at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=260s">00:04:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">by our standard, we need to have a very high standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=263s">00:04:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if the leaders are compromised, automatically the church will be compromised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=269s">00:04:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Along with that, he said, if the leaders are committed to that, the congregation needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=272s">00:04:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to commit to the leadership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=275s">00:04:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so last week we looked at to obey and submit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=278s">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obey and submit basically means to place yourself under, make it easier for them to lead you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=282s">00:04:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and sacrifice for you and pray for you, because it is to your benefit, because God has put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=287s">00:04:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the leaders in charge to watch over the souls of the congregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=290s">00:04:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Today's sermon is a lot more personal, because I'm basically asking for prayer this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=298s">00:04:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very encouraged that we have a church that's praying for our leadership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=303s">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I get an email from our sister Helen once a month, representing the family ministry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=308s">00:05:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "Hey, you have any prayer requests?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=310s">00:05:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so most of the prayer requests that I give probably looks the same as the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=317s">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">months because a lot of things that we get entangled with is kind of hard to share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=322s">00:05:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have to sift through what can I share, what can I not share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=325s">00:05:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But today I wanted to share, representing all the leadership, and this is not just us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=333s">00:05:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so that you can kind of get a better glimpse of what leadership struggles with, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=339s">00:05:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that when you do pray for us, you can pray for us in more detail, more accurately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=345s">00:05:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The prayer request falls into two categories here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=347s">00:05:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When Paul says in verse 18, "Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience,</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=355s">00:05:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing is to pray for our own sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=360s">00:06:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Pray for the sanctification and maturity and growth and wrestling with sins in

href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=369s">00:06:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=375s">00:06:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, his ministry, his prayer is always kind of centered around his ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=379s">00:06:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Give me boldness that the doors may be opened and the

part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/674251982#t=386s">00:06:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first part, when he says, "Pray for us, knowing that
