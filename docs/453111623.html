So the point of all that he's been saying, the author has been saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=122s">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is not simply, "Do you understand who Jesus is?" That wasn't his ultimate goal. His ultimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=127s">00:02:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">goal is, "If you understand who he is, then how will you live?" And his primary concern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=134s">00:02:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't a lack of Christology, even though that was the root cause of them drifting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=140s">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">His primary concern was people were beginning to drift out of the church and go back and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=144s">00:02:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">revert back to their old life. And he recognized the reason why is because maybe they forgot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=150s">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who Jesus is, or they needed to be reminded the supremacy of Christ, that he is above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=155s">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">everything that they're being tempted to drift back to. And so that's why he took all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=159s">00:02:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">time going over details of who Jesus is, that he's greater than the angels, greater than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=165s">00:02:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Moses, greater than the prophets, greater than the sacrificial system. He himself is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=170s">00:02:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the sacrifice. He himself is the high priest. And as a result of that, he says, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=175s">00:02:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">three imperatives. And these imperatives are not unique to this text. In fact, every imperative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=180s">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the New Testament will fall into these three categories, drawing near to God, persevering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=187s">00:03:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and reaching out to others. And the way that I phrased it last week was reach up, reach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=191s">00:03:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in, and reach out. So every imperative, every doctrine of Christ, every doctrine of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=196s">00:03:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel leads to one of these applications, that we are to draw near to God, to persevere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=203s">00:03:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in our faith, and to reach out to other people. So last week, we looked at drawing near to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=208s">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God and to persevere, to hold fast to our confession, right? And so, and it needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=214s">00:03:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be in that order. Because if we draw strength from reaching out to other people, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=219s">00:03:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our primary reason why we do what we do, eventually, you're going to get burnt out. If your primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=225s">00:03:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">feeding and energy is coming from serving other people, eventually, when people disappoint</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=230s">00:03:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you, you will also burn out as well. That's not where we're supposed to get our sustenance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=236s">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the application of the sustenance that we get from Christ. And so the first order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=241s">00:04:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of things that God teaches us always is to draw near to Christ. Where are you with Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=246s">00:04:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just theologically, right? Not just do you have the right answers, but are you walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=251s">00:04:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with Christ? Are you communion with Christ? Can you say that you are in love with Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=256s">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is, is having intimate communion with Christ your primary pursuit in life? And secondly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=261s">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's the case, are you persevering? Are you swerving? Are you being distracted by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=265s">00:04:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that are going on around you? Are you running to other people for sustenance?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=270s">00:04:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is Christ your center? And are you not swerving? Are you persevering in that? And only those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=275s">00:04:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are being fed and strengthened in Christ, we can be led to the third application,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=282s">00:04:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which is to reach out. And this is so important because it gets to the core of why we gather,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=289s">00:04:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">why we're sitting in the hot sun doing what we're doing. Because especially right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=295s">00:04:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the churches are debating one another back and forth online and even among pastors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=300s">00:05:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe even among your friends. Why are you going, why are you, why is your church gathering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=304s">00:05:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">together? Now, why can't we just stay online? What's the big deal? Why is your church so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=310s">00:05:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">worried about this? And there's a back and forth going on between the churches that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=313s">00:05:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">open with the churches that aren't open as to if this is necessary or not necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=321s">00:05:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all the more why this text is so important for us this morning, because it has, it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=325s">00:05:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">direct application of what's happening.

The first thing I want to look at is to let us consider, to consider carefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=346s">00:05:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">contemplate, to deliberately think about, you know, in Hebrews chapter 3, 1, the letter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=353s">00:05:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">started by challenging us to consider Jesus.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=371s">00:06:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so now at the end of this inclusio, this doctrinal part of the, of the Bible, of the book of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=377s">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews, now he says, now that we have considered Christ, let us consider carefully how to stimulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=382s">00:06:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">other people.

If they get on a task, you know it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=968s">00:16:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to be get done. It's going to be, it's going to be done excellently and they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=971s">00:16:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">keep doing it until they aren't doing it anymore. And then there's a lot of people who are well-intending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=978s">00:16:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the first ones to volunteer, but they're also the first ones to flake, you know? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=983s">00:16:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's frustrating because certain things don't get done the way we want it to get done. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=988s">00:16:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever you work with volunteers, that comes with the territory. So we can make it look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=993s">00:16:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">very professional by hiring full-time staff and pay them to get it done. And we can come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=999s">00:16:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to church and enjoy the fruit of the labors of people who've been paid to do it. Or we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1005s">00:16:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">can do it the biblical way. Okay, now you know what I'm talking about. Okay? We come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1009s">00:16:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to church and God has called each one of us to serve, to serve voluntarily as an act of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1016s">00:16:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">worship. And so because there's different levels of maturity, different levels of discipline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1022s">00:17:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">some things get done excellently, some things are done poorly. But the purpose of the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1027s">00:17:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">why we do that is because God has called the church to build the church. Just because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1034s">00:17:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">have finances, it's not a good idea just so that we can make it look better. See, our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1041s">00:17:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">church is filled with people who are volunteering as an act of worship. And so the calling is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1047s">00:17:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">let us consider, think carefully how our lives and our behavior and our speech can provoke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1052s">00:17:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">other people toward love and good deeds. So when you're surrounded by people who are serving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1058s">00:17:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's naturally, naturally it provokes other people to serve. And that's what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1062s">00:17:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">desire in the church, right? Not to make you feel guilty about serving, but to provoke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1068s">00:17:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you to serve, to want to serve. So when new people come to church and they see a church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1073s">00:17:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">filled with people volunteering, coming to church early to set up, to clean afterwards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1078s">00:17:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and they might be thinking, "Oh, how come the other church that I was at, they hired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1082s">00:18:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">all these people to get this done and it's done so well." And then they might sit here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1087s">00:18:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and just kind of like enjoy, you know, everything's running so well, but just enjoy the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1094s">00:18:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are called to live in such a way that others are to be provoked. Every morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1100s">00:18:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">if you show up here early, as early as 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, probably 6.30 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1105s">00:18:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier than that, there's a group of people here who comes every Sunday who sets up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1109s">00:18:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">AV.

At least at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1194s">00:19:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning, right? Well, I mean, obviously you guys know what happened, it started and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1199s">00:19:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">then you had all these people in the church volunteering, you know, gourmet meals, piano</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1204s">00:20:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">lessons to take pictures, boat rides, dental services, eye care, you know, free sunglasses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1212s">00:20:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and all these things and then, you know, off-road camping and raised over $10,000, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1220s">00:20:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the church.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1244s">00:20:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it was just, again, it's because a couple just thought that, "How can we, how can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1249s">00:20:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">provoke the church?" And our whole church was affected by it, right? And even now when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1254s">00:20:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think about it, man, that was, that was not, it wasn't just a good idea, but the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1260s">00:21:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, the couple decided like, "Oh, they want to make the most of the situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1265s">00:21:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're in," while everybody else may be thinking, "What are we going to do?" And maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1270s">00:21:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we were thinking that. And as a result, the whole church was provoked. We raised money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1274s">00:21:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">for good causes, you know, people were volunteering, they're paying for four $500 meals, crazy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1281s">00:21:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Going off-road and spending three days with people you don't know, you know, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1286s">00:21:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">then building relationships. We were all provoked.

The church gathers together. Even when we were offline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1300s">00:21:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they were working toward, "How do we do this? How do we provoke each other on toward loving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1305s">00:21:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">good deeds?" And that's what he was saying, that we ought to contemplate and think and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1310s">00:21:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to consider and to apply, "How can we build a church where just being a part of the church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1317s">00:21:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">provokes other people to love and to commit their lives to good works?" He says to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1326s">00:22:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this, "Not forsaking our own assembling together." The reason why he's saying that is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1332s">00:22:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what was happening in the early church. It's not just coming out of nowhere. Part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1337s">00:22:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of the reason, part of the ramification of people drifting was that they were beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1342s">00:22:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to neglect their assembly because that's usually what happens when people are not doing well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1346s">00:22:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritually. One of the first things that you see is that they don't gather. They feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1350s">00:22:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">guilty, they feel shame, or they're disgruntled, and one of the first thing that is is they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1355s">00:22:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">don't see the importance of the gathering. So some people were just beginning to drift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1362s">00:22:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, that's the reason why this is written, is to get them back to church, to get them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1368s">00:22:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to gather together. But the other reason why is because the persecution was intense. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1375s">00:22:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for the first time, there were physical consequences for their gathering. And that's the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1381s">00:23:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">why he keeps saying, "All the more as you see the day drawing near." He didn't say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1387s">00:23:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, let's gather together as long as it's safe. Let's not drift as long as everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1392s">00:23:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is good." He said, "All the more, all the more as it becomes dangerous, all the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1397s">00:23:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as the world becomes more hostile to the Christian faith." He says, "All the more not forsaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1402s">00:23:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">our own assembling together." The church, 1 Timothy 3.15 says, "It is the household</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1410s">00:23:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of God."

Maybe there's some young parents who have children, or sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/453111623#t=1429s">00:23:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're sick, or you may be out of town.
