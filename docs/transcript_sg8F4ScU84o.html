And, God, our heart would always be growing in wisdom, knowledge, and love for you. We ask, God, that each time we come, just to discuss, to apply, you would allow us to have spiritual growth.</p><p>Help us, Father God, to gain conviction. Help us, Lord, to continue to develop in our faith, in our worldview, in the way that we see our own lives, and particularly in the way that we see you. And, Lord, we always pray that as we gather our voices to sing, we always pray, Father God, it would be exalting and pleasing in your sight.</p><p>It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

He has shed his blood for our stead and glorified you in his act of obedience all the way through. Lord, I pray that our congregation would take in your word and may the word that gets inputted never return to you void and that it would be planted deep, rooted deep and may it cause in us obedience, may it cause in us a desire for a deeper praise and worship to you.</p><p>We thank you and we lift you up in Christ's name, amen. - All right. Good evening again. I've got just some highlight announcements for you guys. So please pray the kids event tomorrow, the reformation night is happening and an advanced thank you to all of you guys who are volunteering and helping out with that event.</p><p>We have a lot of people who are doing everything from cooking to the trunks. So thank you for doing that. Just as a note, the parking situation, obviously in a midweek, it gets a little bit tricky, but for those of you guys who are volunteering and coming beforehand, please note that the far lots, lot G, which is in the loop way over there, OTA, Online Training Academy, that's going to be open and so is the F lot as well.</p><p>Near us, lot A, which is across the street and C will be open and we're grateful that actually one of our neighbors, so behind the same train to the left, Zylum has opened up their lot for us. Our request is those of you guys who are helping out, et cetera, please try to park in the farther lots and then start filling up from the distance ones and then fill up closer, even with the parking variance we have on the street.</p><p>So this side of our street here on Mitchell, we can park along the curb, but even that, if we can start from the far end and come work towards the church, that will be really, really appreciated. Okay, the next announcement for us is that the Men's Ministry Fellowship is taking place November 9th, Saturday, 9 a.m.</p><p>Please make sure to sign up for that early so we can prepare snacks, food. It's going to be a great time of fellowship, learning. We're going to have small group discussion, et cetera. So please sign up for that, and it's just $10 per person. The next announcement is Thanksgiving Outreach Dinner.</p><p>That one is different from our regional Thanksgiving dinner. The outreach team is preparing a special dinner where we can host our unbelieving family and friends, and we're going to have it here at church, Saturday, November 16th. So you will see the QR code. If you'd like for the outreach team to pray alongside you for your family and friends who are nonbelievers and you want, in that holiday season, for an event to bring them out and extend the time to have dinner, et cetera, please sign up for that.</p><p>Let us know, and we'll join you in prayer. The next announcement is Cleaning Maintenance Day on Saturday, November 23rd. This event, again, is an awesome time. You guys have been there. It's like you see people throughout the entire campus. If you'd like to participate and lend a hand in making our church tidy and clean, please sign up for that.</p><p>There's so many various tasks that are at hand, so you guys can sign up and look for the details. If you have any questions, just email the logistics team, and they'll be happy to give you more information about it. Okay? Great. So then with that, please go ahead and go straight into your discussion.</p><p>We'll be back at 8. Thank you.
