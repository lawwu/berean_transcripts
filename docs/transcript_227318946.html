And I'm going to be talking about the first message. In the Journal of the American Medical Association, 276 volunteers were infected with a virus that produces the common cold. And the study found that people with strong emotional connections did four times better fighting off illness. These people were less susceptible to colds, had less viruses, and they produced significantly less mucus than relationally isolated people. They produced less mucus. Basically, people in isolation are snottier than people who are in common. Psychology is just catching up here with the wisdom of God. And God knew that when He first made Adam, He understood the profound nature of whom He had created, namely Adam and the image of God, and how to bring that into culmination. And so how does God respond to this aloneness? When in verse 22 of chapter 2 we see exactly what He does. "And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man He made into a woman, and brought her to the man. And the man said," he starts rapping poetry for you ladies, "This is at last bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. She shall be the woman because she was taken out of man." Verse 24, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." So we made a man into a lus. See that? He made man into an us. The very revelation of who God is that was revealed to us from the beginning. Let us make man. The two became one flesh. And so now what we see is a representation of them imaging God even more so. Because God is a communal being. He describes to us that He made us to be in verse 18 of chapter 2. "And the Lord said, 'It is good that man should be alone. I will make him a helper fit.'" Everybody say "helper." "Helper." Now, that word is "ezer" in the Greek. And that's a very hard word and scholars are all over the place with it. But one of the best, it seems like, and what most people kind of come together with, as far as the translation and understanding of that word, is a "helper companion." So verse 18, "The Lord said, 'It's not good that man should be alone.'" And it fits because He's talking about His loneliness. "And so I will make him a" what? "a helper companion." A friend. One to come alongside Anna in her journey through life. Pursuing together God's passion for His world. So what makes for a strong marriage? What is the foundation for true compatibility? Is it physical attractiveness? Is it sexual chemistry? How can you know if you've married your soulmate? When you find a lifelong friend. It's seeing in your spouse that they are your BFF. Your best friend. Forever. Which probably Harrison. We haven't talked about that. Keller says this, "When I met my future wife, Kathy, we sensed very quickly that we shared an unusual number of books, stories, themes, ways of thinking about life, and experiences that brought us joy. We recognized in one another a true kindred spirit and the potential for a bond of deep friendship. But this is not what many young adults mean when they speak of "compatible" soulmates. See, what I'm trying to do here is redefine. Change our categories. Because we get infiltrated so much by the world and how they define that we begin to take that on. And then we begin to look at our marriages and say, "Well, if the world is saying this is what compatibility is, and I'm not seeing this form of compatibility in my relationship, so maybe we've got problems. Maybe I made a mistake. Or we need to go get some counseling because we've got to fix it." That was something that even we, in our own journey, my wife and myself, as we were in marriage, and the honeymoon stage kind of begins to dissipate. And there was a point where we were kind of talking and just saying, "You know, all of the romantic things that we all used to feel about one another, this kind of doesn't seem like it's there anymore. And it just feels like you're just kind of my best friend." And we just kind of hang out, we're roommates, we do everything together. We hang, we eat potato chips, we joke, and we watch movies. And we both kind of looked at it like, "Man, that kind of sucks." We don't have any more sparks. Where's the chemistry? Where are things exploding in our marriage? All the different things we see on movies. And it started to cause for us to say, "Man, maybe there's something wrong here. Maybe this is not right." And that's why I want to encourage you guys. We've got to have biblical categories. And the more we have biblical categories, the more we can actually make and decipher just where our relationships really are and who they aren't. For decades, researchers have explored what is at the core of the best marriages. While studies have found many factors predict stable, happy marriages, all of the research converges on one thing--friendship, not romance. Now, fellas, that doesn't get you off the hook. So ladies, I'm not trying to get your husbands off the hook. You've got to romance your wives, man. You've got to always do that. For wives, don't be discouraged when you just feel like, "Man, I just feel like the romance isn't there. Man, I don't know if he's a--we have some males, too, that are romantics." And you're saying, "Man, I'm just not feeling it." We have some romantics men in here? I'm not going to leave you all out. That's right. Don't start to allow for that to make you question the depth of your relationship with your spouse. Yesterday, as we were talking about sex and marriage, there's something that I wanted to talk about and I'm in light of that, and I like the way the Kellers really put--because you can understand the parallel between the way that their relationship developed over time, how it moved into friendship, and the effect that it had on their sexual relationship. And he says this. He says, "In our early days," as I was looking at some of my notes, "it reminded me that in those years when we first started our marriage, we dreaded having sex." "Kathy, in those remarks, said that if she didn't experience an orgasm during lovemaking, we both felt like failures." "If I asked her, 'How was that?' and she said, 'It just hurt,' I felt devastated, and she did, too." "We had a great deal of trouble until we started to see something," as Kathy says in her notes. "We came to realize that orgasm is great, especially climaxing together, but the awe, the wonder, the safety, and the joy of just being one like friends is stirring and stunning even without that." Even when we stopped trying, and when we stopped trying to perform, and just tried to start simply loving one another, sex actually started moving ahead. We stopped worrying about our performance, and we stopped worrying about what we were getting, and started saying, "Well, what can we do to just give to one another?" This concept also has implications for the typical problem that many couples experience in their marital relationship, namely that one person wants it more than the other. If your main purpose is sex and giving pleasure, not getting pleasure, then a person who doesn't have as much of a sex drive physically can give to the other person and just give it to them as a gift. Because that's my friend. This is a legitimate act of love, and it shouldn't be denigrated by saying, "Oh, no, no, no, no, don't do that." Unless you're going to be all passionate, don't do it. No. Do it as a gift. That's friendship. That's a companion. I just want to tell you, and this is kind of how it works from what I've seen, as I've kind of seen it. Initially, guys, we have a whole lot of testosterone, so we're chasing y'all. We're chasing the women. And so you guys are like, "Back up, back up. Get them off me. Leave me alone." It reverses. So ladies, be ready, because you guys are going to start doing like this, and he's going to start doing like this. And what I've been finding is, is with older couples, they're having complaints because they're like, "My husband, I'm trying to get to him, and he don't want to do nothing at all." And she's like, "Ready to go." And so why do I bring that up? Because that area, if that's going to be the barometer for the depth of your intimacy, I'm sorry. It's going to go like this all throughout your relationship. And that's why friendship has to be the center for which you guys develop the depth of your relationship toward one another. Gottman is found, and he's a world-premier marriage scholar, summarizes more than two decades of research and dozens of studies, and he says the simple truth is this, the happy marriage is based on deep friendships. He also found that the quality of a married couple's friendship is the most important predictor of satisfaction with sex, romance, and passion. As simple as it sounds, happy marriages are based on a foundation of friendship. Period. And that's what we see here in Genesis. God's main focus in relationships was to create companionship. And that's where true happiness comes, in marriage. So secondarily, how can you experience the benefit of true soulmate compatibility? I'm going to give you three ways to reach BFF status, if you will, in your marriage. We see it first in Malachi chapter 2. Malachi chapter 2, verse 14. Malachi chapter 2, verse 14. We'll look at verse 13. And this second thing you do, you cover the Lord's ultimate tears with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. But you say, why does he not? So what's the context here? God is not accepting their worship. He's not accepting their sacrifice. He's not embracing their attempts to demonstrate just how much they're dedicated, committed to, and love God. And why is he not accepting it? Verse 14. But you say, why does he not? Because the Lord was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she was your, ESV, what's that word you guys? Companion and your wife by, what's that next word? Covenant. So we have an apposition here. God helps us to understand companionship by defining it as covenant. So the first way that you reach BFF status in your marriage is constancy. That's the first C. I'm going to do three C's. Constancy. I've used the other word permanence. You can say covenant. Basically, you can't have friendship without covenant. You can't have true friendship without promise. This text also supports God's intention for making women in the first place. Because it is a severing of friendship. Notice that's his focus. He's severed a friendship that caused God to feel the way he feels. You see, here's the value in covenant and constancy. Here's the value. Is that when you look at me and you tell me there is nothing that you can do that's going to keep me from loving you. What does that do for me? It creates a place of safety. It creates a place of security. And it diminishes my pressure to perform for you in order to gain your favor. See, a lot of times in marriage, when I first started, that's all I was trying to do. Perform. I told you guys my wife had that long list. Well, I had to keep that up. Because I felt like, you know what? If I don't live up to these standards that she's looking at, then she's going to look at me one day and say, you know what? I'm through with you. I'm hitting the door because you haven't fulfilled anything. But what covenant does is it says, I already know you're not going to fulfill all these things. So you can be your true self, which is broken, messed up, and jacked up. And you can know even in your true self, I'm not going anywhere. That creates the environment for competition. Outside of that, you don't have friendship. Those are my deepest friends. Right? Your deepest friends are the friends that know all your jerk, all of your failures, all of your foibles, and yet they still say, dude, I got your back. Girl, I'm on your team. I'm going to tell you when you're wrong and when you're tripping, I'm going to do that because I'm your friend. But I'm not going anywhere. Those are the people that you have for a lifetime. Here's the mile moment, marriage and life in eternity, that I want to focus you in. Marriage was designed to image first. Image to image or reflect the companionship of the Trinity. And girl, I'm always trying to take these concepts for you guys and bring them from the earth to heaven. I want you to understand that the call that you have in marriage, I wanted to always help you to understand what it means for God to be God. For us to understand the Trinity better. So when you walk out, you basically understand, man, the Father's relationship and Jesus' relationship is one of promise. That's why they have such a deep, profound relationship. They are covenanted and committed to one another. Proverbs 18 and I put your fingers there. 22 to 24. We read this, but sometimes I think we don't connect it. And proverbs are kind of hard because sometimes they are isolated statements. Verse 24. He who finds a wife finds a good thing. Everybody say good things. And attains favor from the Lord. So what's the good thing? Just being focused on there. I'm a challenge you on this. What is the good thing? What makes marriage the good? And we can try to talk about all kinds of different things. But if we keep it in the context, I want you to see something. The poor use entreaties, but the rich answer roughly. Verse 24. A man of many companions may come to ruin. But there is a what? Friend who sticks closer. There's covenant glue who sticks closer than a brother. So what I'm seeing here is in verse 22. The good thing that you gain in a husband. The good thing that you gain in a wife. The good thing that you gain is verse 24. Where you don't have many companions. But you have that one friend who sticks closer than a brother. Good marriage. Loving marriage. Comes together through committed friendship. That is covenanted. Constant. It's not going anywhere. The second way you achieve BFF. In your marriage is candor. Candor. It's being real. Open. Now I'm just going to break that down in ways that candor looks. The first area that candor looks like in your relationship. What is true friendship? Candor is to encourage and affirm. You guys as friends. One to another. You need to be engaged in encouraging and affirming one another. Proverbs 27.9 says this. Oil and perfume make the heart glad. And the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel. One individual wrote it like this. And I think this is a good description of candor. When it comes to encouraging and affirming. All the comfort. Donna Craig says. The second thing that candor looks like is. A real friend points out one another's sin. You point out one another's sin. Proverbs 27.5-6 says. Better is open rebuke than hidden love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Here's a discussion question that you guys can engage in as couples. How open are you and your spouse to feedback when it comes to the truth about yourself? How open are you about the areas of brokenness that are in your life. That you are willing to allow for your spouse without being defensive to speak into. Because true friends they confront. And they confront though in love. That's another discussion question you guys can discuss. You know honey the reason why I'm having a hard time receiving from you. Is because when you come at me it doesn't feel like you love me when you do it. It's hard for me to receive from you because you know what sometimes it's hard to hear it. In the way that you're bringing it. Ephesians chapter 4 says. Be kind and compassionate to one another. Forgiving each other just as God in Christ has forgiven you. Galatians 6.14 we're familiar with it brothers. If someone has caught in a sin. You who are spiritual should restore him in what way? Gently. Gently. Is gentleness a part of your interactions as a couple? When it comes to confrontation and sin. The other part of candor is that friends they sharpen one another. They sharpen one another. Proverbs 27.17 iron sharpens iron. And that works best in the context of what? Friendship. The people that have been the most sharpening if you will to me are my friends. And the one that has been best for me has been my wife. Ruth. I'm a prideful person. And that's something that I've struggled with for years and years and years. I gained my worth in my ability to perform. I was the runt if you will in my family. I was first born. But families we had a large family. My grandmother had ten children. So tons of cousins. And the black family is one where just really family is just central in so many ways. And so I spent a lot of time at my grandmothers house and there was a core of cousins that I had that were all around the same age of all the kids that my grandmother had. You guys know what I'm saying. I was the youngest out of those. At the same time too I was born prematurely. And so as a result I didn't develop and grow as quickly as some of my other cousins did. Even some of my other friends. So I was always little. And they called me Red Red. That was my nickname Red Red. Little Red Red. And I was small. I was tiny. I was skinny. And little all the time. And so I always felt like I had to perform even better just to reach where everybody else was. And that developed in me over time to where it just became a part of my makeup. Frustrated with being passed over. Even in high school wanting to play ball and still being so small where I was like 5'5", 5'4", like 110 pounds. And again in high school everybody else there was 6'1", 6'2", 180. And I'm trying to play varsity. Getting passed over. And so throughout our marriage, when we got married I brought this into our marriage. And I was always trying to avoid the presentation of my weaknesses. I just didn't want my wife to just know where I was weak. And so what I would do is when she would see something in me, what would I do? I'd get defensive. I'd try to explain it away. And she used to get frustrated because I would put her in all these twisty ties because I'm a pastor. So I started using my language like, "Mm, this and that." And she's like, "I don't understand it. After 10 minutes you talk around it. Now it's my problem. And it was your problem. How did you always do that?"  And my wife was trying to be that ironing, sharpening iron. But when she would talk about issues in my fatherly, I would get defensive and try to explain it away and show just how good of a dad I was. When it came to my pastoral leadership, she would say, "Ah, maybe you need to look at this." I would try to explain that away. When it came to my role as a husband, I just couldn't recede from her. And she would point this sin out in me constantly, day after day after day, year after year after year. And it was really as I began to find and discover it was a result of my insecurities. Just being an insecure man, that little boy still, that's trying to perform so that I can be recognized and have a game and have work. And here's what a true friend does. She saw this in me, but I didn't see it. And like an onion over the years, the Lord just used my wife to just peel away those various areas of pride in my life. And it really was like, "Man, oh wow. Okay. Oh, there's another one. Man, there's another one." And I give my wife a lot of credit because a true friend sticks closer than a brother. Now, with somebody like me, she was already done after year one. She was like, "Dude, you are such a prideful individual." But she stuck with me for the last 19 years. And just presently there's an issue in our church where we're looking for a church move. And a lot of complaining, a lot of where we're going to be, and why is it that the leadership hasn't stepped up in the way that it should have. And you guys should have been seeing this a long time ago and should have planned for it. And now we're scrambling because of you guys' poor leadership. So I'm just hearing a lot of things. And I'm feeling this sense of, "I've got to perform. I'm going to show you guys. I'm going to show you guys. I can do this. I can do this." And my wife, again, just paused and she said, "Ray, it's coming up again." And I just remember looking. We were in my room and we were talking. And I just buckled and I started weeping. And I just said, "Honey, I'm more prideful than I realize. And I'm telling you right now, I can't do this." And for the first time, really, after 19 years of her walking me through this, she looked at me and she says, "Now you got it. Now you got it. And I still love you in your weakness, in your pride. You don't have to perform for me. You just need to be who you really are." And so I got up in front of the church and I told her the same thing. And she says, "Honey, I'm so proud of you." I said, "You know what? I just have to tell you, I'm not the pastor that you guys think I am. I'm just another. I'm so broken. I have so many limitations. And I'm so weak. And so I'm telling you guys right now moving forward, you just got to trust in the grace of God and His power in your weakness. That's it. That's all I can do." You see, if I didn't have a friend like my wife, who stuck with me, a lot of my pride hurt her so deeply, so deeply. And yet she still said, "I'll go to you. I got your back." That's the value of true friendship. And that's what you gain in marriage. You see, I'm a better version of who I am today because of my wife. I was always trying to fit in being a better dad, being a better husband, being a better pastor. But as God began to remove the layers of pride, I began to be able to receive from my wife and to hear from her. And I'm so glad that He gave me my wife. I'm a better dad because of my wife. And it was hard to hear the things that she had to say about my fatherhood. I didn't have a father who really engaged me. He was there. And I gave him credit for that. But he didn't engage me. And my wife used to beat on my head all the time. Like, "You got to go out there and throw the ball with that boy. You got to go and take the girls out on dates. You got to spend time. You got to sit down." I used to be like, "Man, why are you always on my head?" My son, for Father's Day, just gave me a gift. I just wanted to share with you. He wrote this. I grew up in the '90s. He called it the '90s dad. He said, "I grew up with a '90s dad, the best friend I ever had. I said some stuff I regret, and boy, I get mad. Thought about the arguments, too, but everything's put in perspective when I remember that I'm nothing without you. My pops was my mellow man, and I was always a fan. I'll forever remember the good times, starting up the car, listening to beats and rhymes. My dad and I were like statics, constantly hitting equilibrium when we'd listen to mathematics. Sometimes life was hard, with school and chores. But Dad would always remind me that the world was yours. Always wanted to wear his shoes, shorts, and his hats. You see, my pops was cool like that. We were a tag team. He always had my back. Anyone who'd come against us was biggity, biggity whack. My dad would always pay the bills. Life was about for him, and it was uphill. But I love him from '93 to. I love my old man, the little things he would do, even on Easter. Forget Jay-Z and Nas, call us either. We will all be remembered for something one day, and that's true. Even if you live, Dad, to your 92. Some could live like my dad, but only a few. I'm proud to carry your name. We come from the same blood, and I ain't talking about kindred or gang. So one day, Dad, you're going to see how much I grew. I ain't going to be perfect, but I'm going to be the best man people ever knew. And one day, when you cross to the other side, just know I'll be rolling with my kids, listening to "Far Side." Because you're the best dad I ever knew. And boy, I'm going to have stories to tell when I reminisce over you. That's because of my wife. That's because of my wife.  She sharpened me. My little girls, teenagers, they still kiss me. That's because of my wife. I took my girls out on dates when they were little girls and told them, "I'm your man. I'm always going to be your man." I told somebody to put a ring on her hand. And they still want to go out with Daddy to this day. It's because of her wife.  The Lord says this. Within this Christian vision of marriage, the key to falling in love, girls, is to look at one another and get a glimpse of what God is creating and say, "I see who God is making you, and it excites me. I want to be a part of that. I want to partner with you and God in the journey you are taking to His throne. And when you get there, I will look at your magnificence and say, 'I always knew you could be like this. I got glimpses in on her, but now look at you.'"  That's what marriage is all about. And that's what candor provides in a marriage. That's why it's so critical. If there's pretense, if you're trying to perform in your marriage, just stop. Be the true you that you really are. You are messed up and you are broken. And guess what? Your wife and your husband, they know it. So stop trying to hide it and create an environment where Adam and Eve had, naked and not ashamed. Allow for your spouse to be the broken self that they are. Don't create an environment where they have to perform so they can be free to say, "You know what, honey? I know I have been falling short in this area, but I'm just struggling and I'm having a hard time. But you know what? It may take me 15 years to get this right. Will you walk with me?" Well, there's one last area, one last seed that creates BFF, as I conclude, that will give you BFF status in your marriage. And it's a common passion, a common passion that touches eternity. That's key. A common passion that touches eternity. We see in Genesis chapters 1, 26 and 28 as we read it. God said and gave them an eternal, eternal kingdom passion. They were supposed to take dominion and spread the glory of God to the rest of the world. That was their call. Take dominion. Extend who I am everywhere. And they together were called to do that, verses 26 through 28. And I like the way Keller puts it. There's a third quality of friendship, and it is not as easy to put into simple words. The right word literally is sympathy, sympathos, common passion. This means that friendships are discovered more than they are created at will. Ralph Waldo Emerson and C.S. Lewis each wrote well-known essays about how a common vision can unite people of very different temperaments. I was reading the book that you guys read by Francis Chan, and he gave an example, and he talked about that. Having a common passion and how it brings you together regardless of who's on the team. He goes on to say, "Lewis insisted that the essence "of friendship is the exclamation, 'You too?' "While erotic love can be depicted as two people "looking at one another, friendship can be depicted "as two people standing side by side "looking at the same object and being "stern and entranced by it together." You hear that? That's my question as you guys go into even questions and talk about your marriages. Here's another question. What is it that you are entranced by together that is of eternal significance in your marriage? It's got to be something else other than you guys looking face to face, because sometimes you've got to stop looking at each other. Sometimes you're so busy looking at each other that it's always this, "Well, you're not this," and "Boo, boo," and "You're not this," and "Blah, blah, blah," and "Not like that," and "Not like that." Stop doing all that and just do this. Let's go this way. What have we got that we can run after together as a couple? You see, God placed Adam and Eve in the garden, and they had a common passion to bear His image. And it drove their waking and their sleeping. It occupied their heart, soul, and mind and strength, and a common passion to spread the image of God around the world, cultivating, guarding, protecting the garden, and expanding it to the uninhabited world. There's a reason why I married my wife. One of the most attractive things to her, for me, is that she had a passion for the kingdom, and she wanted to live for Christ and Christ alone. That's what bonded us. When I came side by side and my wife aspired, man, it was like, "Okay, we're going to do this together for the sake of the kingdom." That brought us together like no other, and that's what keeps driving us and our relationship to this day. That depth, that deepens our relationship because we're in this--because guess what? The kids are going to be gone, you guys. They're going to be gone. Okay, I'm looking at it now like, "Wow! My baby girl was like this big. She just turned 18 last week." And then the question becomes is, after everybody's out and everybody's flown to coop, are we going to be looking at each other, wondering, "Oh, boy, now what do we do?" But see, we already got a common passion. We side by side. We already make a plan. It's like, "Man, hurry up and get out so we can do this." Me and Mommy are trying to get busy. Y'all are cramping the style, man. Get on. Y'all think you're on vibes. Here's my question, you guys. What does your kingdom dream together? How has God called the two of you together to live out a Genesis 1, 26 through 28 purpose? That is every couple's purpose. Genesis 1, 26 through 28. He has called you as his image bearer to take dominion for the sake of his name. The question is, how is he calling you guys together to do it? I'm going to stop right there and talk about that a little later. As I conclude, what do we see Adam and Eve having? They have a common passion, not an eternal one. They had the next seed, constancy, one flesh covenant. And they had the next seed, candor. They were naked and not ashamed. Verse 25, chapter 1. What does that help us to see, even in Genesis? That when God created Adam and Eve, they had the markings of true companionship with those three things in existence. Common passion, constancy, and candor. If you want a strong marriage, it's not going to be determined by sexual chemistry. It's not going to be determined by common interests like we like watching movies or we like going on hikes. You want to have a strong marriage? You want to have one that will last for a lifetime with joy? Engage in developing a friendship. Let that define your relationship and nothing else. No matter what the world says, no matter when your girlfriend comes to you and says, "Girl, he's struggling." "He's not this, man." Or the fellows, "I just don't know, man." "She's just..." Friendship. And if you guys can look at each other and say, "Man, we're just best friends." And we engage in what friendship is and common passion, constancy, and candor, you guys are going to be all right. Amen? Let's pray. God, we come before you right now. We just thank you for the Lord's truth. God, I just pray. I ask you, Lord, please, right now, that you would deepen the friendships in this world. That husband and wife would gain greater levels of friendship that they have presently. And that you would do that by power of the Holy Spirit. And that, Lord, for those that are wondering, "Man, we don't have a common passion." We don't have a common passion. God, I ask you right now that you would begin to birth a common passion in every single couple in this room. That they would come to see, Lord God, the way you are uniquely calling them together to spread your name. And God, I ask you, Lord, that Lord, we know that that can't happen without a constancy. If there are some, Lord God, in this room that are saying, "Yeah, I'm kind of waffling. "You know, a part of me has thought, "you know, maybe divorce is a good option "or maybe just separation. "Or, you know what, I'm just going to check out "mentally and emotionally from this relationship. "I'm just going to kind of sever myself. "I'll stay married, but I'm not going to stay engaged." God, I pray, Lord God, that you would move upon whatever heart is in that place right now. That you, by the power of your Holy Spirit, would move them, Lord God, to a deeper level than they have ever experienced of a constancy in their resolve and their love toward their spouse. And God, last thing, I pray, and I ask you, Lord God, in Jesus' name, that you would allow for candor to be a hallmark in every relationship you handle. God, I pray that you create in each marriage an area and a measure of safety. Two things have to happen, Lord. One, we've got to stop trying to hold up and be what we're not. And so, God, I pray you break down whatever needs to in every single heart to just be their true self. But then, God, the second thing has to happen, and that's that the other spouse has to say, "If you are your true self to me, "I'm going to love you no matter how lovely you look." And so, God, I pray that there be a heart of just acceptance, forgiveness, and commitment to say, "No matter what you look like, I'm going to be there." And we're going to work together to become, for you to become the true you that God wants you to be in, Jesus, until he calls us home. I pray this, God, in Jesus' name. As we typically do, let's take some time to come before the Lord and reflect on our...</p></div></body></html>
