Let's make our way over to our tables. We'll begin our evening with worship time again. Let's get settled in. All right, please join with me in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we really thank you always, knowing, God, that every opportunity, every day, we have your mercies and your grace and your ministry unto us.</p><p>And, God, we are gathered wanting to grow from your powerful Word. We're gathered wanting to worship the Lord who is in our midst. And I pray, Father God, that all the energy, the time, preparation, that all these things, Father God, would be so beneficial to our faith. God, help us as we study and look intently into your Word to see greater measures of your character.</p><p>Help us, Father God, to appreciate you to a greater degree and to know even to greater depths the sacrifice of our Lord. And in this way, God, help us, even if there aren't necessarily something to do or a task at hand, that ultimately we would just be growing in our affections for the Lord.</p><p>So now, as we sing to you, God, I do pray that as we join, not just in voice but in heart, we want to exalt you and lift you up. It's in Christ's name, amen. There's no one like you, my Lord No one could take your place My heart beats to worship you I live just to seek your face There's no one like you, my Lord No one could take your place There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you You are my God You're everything to me There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you You are my God You're everything to me There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you There's no one like you There's no one like you, my Lord No one could take your place I long for your presence, Lord To serve you is my reward There's no one like you, my Lord No one could take your place There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you You are my God You're everything to me There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you You are my God You're everything to me There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you You are my God You're everything to me There's no one like you, my Lord No one like you  Grace and Peace Grace and Peace Oh, how can this be For lawbreakers and thieves For the worthless, the least You have said That our judgment is death For all eternity Without hope, without rest Oh, what an amazing mystery What an amazing mystery That your grace has come to me  Grace and Peace Oh, how can this be The matchless King of all Paid the blood price for me Slaughtered Lamb What atonement you bring The vilest sinner's heart Can be cleansed, can be free Oh, what an amazing mystery What an amazing mystery That your grace has come to me  Grace and Peace Oh, how can this be But songs of gratefulness Ever rise, never cease Loved by God And called as a saint My heart is satisfied In the riches of Christ Oh, what an amazing mystery What an amazing mystery That your grace has come to me  Oh, what an amazing love I see What an amazing love I see That your grace has come to me Oh, what an amazing love I see What an amazing love I see That your grace has come to me  Oh, what an amazing love I see What an amazing love I see That your grace has come to me Oh, what an amazing love I see What an amazing love I see That your grace has come to me  Father, we thank you for who you are.</p><p>We thank you for the grace that you've shown to us in sending Christ down to live on this earth, to live a perfect life, to be our great high priest, came to fulfill the law. We thank you so much and we pray that with what we read today, would it be a reminder of our admiration and the gratefulness of Christ and how Christ is the ultimate sacrifice, Lord.</p><p>We pray you'd be with us tonight. We pray for a fruitful time of discussion. We thank you, Lord. We love you and pray all this in your name. Amen. All right. Welcome again, everybody. For those of you guys at the door, you guys can come on in. Please note that the cafe next week will be open on Friday the 28th.</p><p>We're really grateful for our volunteers who are manning the cafe there. Whenever we have an evening event, they're trying to open up the cafe so you guys can do your studies, your work, et cetera. So please take advantage of that. That's Friday the 28th from 10.30 a.m. The cafe will be open.</p><p>And so aligned with that, next week is gonna be our all church praise and prayer. Please make sure to show up at 7.30 at the latest. Come on into the sanctuary where we're gonna be having extended time of worship, of our personal and corporate prayer. Okay, so please note that on your calendar.</p><p>So again, no Bible study, praise and prayer next week. I'd like to highlight the Women's Ministry Tea Time event. So for all the sisters, this is a special opportunity for you to get together in smaller mixed affinity. Okay, so the groups will be mixed throughout various homes. The last call for signups is happening now.</p><p>So please make sure you get on the app or go ahead and click that QR code and sign up to participate in that fellowship time. And then as you guys know, we have been announcing our Passion Week that the time goes fast and it'll be quickly around the corner.</p><p>For all of you guys who have not ever experienced doing the Passover meal, we really do encourage you to participate in that because it'll be just an awesome time seeing how the ritual really points and directs to Christ. So that one particularly is at 6.30 p.m. on Thursday night, April 17th, here in the Fellowship Hall in the cafe.</p><p>So sign up for that. You do have to pre-register to participate. And then for Passion Week, as you guys have heard, there's going to be so many things moving throughout the entirety of the week. We'd love to enlist some volunteers to help out with everything from setup to food prep and parking and more.</p><p>So if you'd like to help out and volunteer that day, please go ahead and click that link and then volunteer your time. The last announcement is for those of you who are new. We have a membership class that's going to start on April 27th. That's a Sunday from 9.30.</p><p>It's an eight-week course, but it will cover all the foundational doctrines of the church and our church practices. So we welcome you to sign up for that if you're interested in membership here at church. Okay, so that's all the announcements. Please go into your discussion time, and then we'll see you guys at 8.</p></div></body></html>
