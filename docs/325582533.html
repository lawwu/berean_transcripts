We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=32s">00:00:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pray for your grace, we pray for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us.

Alright, so as you probably have noticed that there is a major transition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=41s">00:00:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that takes place between chapter 2 and chapter 3. Can somebody tell me what that is? We mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=50s">00:00:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it in the overview study. What is the transition that took place between chapter 2 and chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=59s">00:00:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">3? Take a guess from what you've seen. Or maybe you remember from our introduction study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=78s">00:01:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Chapter entering into the imperatives. So chapter 1 and 2 predominantly was indicative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=86s">00:01:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">basically describing what happened, who he is, who we are in light of that. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=91s">00:01:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">look at chapter 3 and 4, it's imperatives of therefore you should do this, therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=96s">00:01:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what you ought to do. So predominant, it doesn't mean every single verse is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=100s">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that, but it's indicative, this is why you should do what you should be doing, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=104s">00:01:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is what you should be doing. Right? Is that just in this book? No. Much of the New Testament</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=109s">00:01:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is organized exactly in that way. Right? It begins by saying this is what has happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=114s">00:01:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what Jesus has done, this is who he is, therefore this is what you ought to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=119s">00:01:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? So that's a big transition that's taking place in chapter 3 and 4. So we've been studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=124s">00:02:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot about the gospel, and then now we're going to be talking about the implications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=128s">00:02:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gospel. Okay? So before we jump into the text itself, I wanted to introduce a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=133s">00:02:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of study tools. Now, obviously this is not outdated, but the avenue in which you access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=144s">00:02:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is definitely outdated. So a long time ago when I used to prepare sermons and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=149s">00:02:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible study, I would have to get maybe about five or six of these reference books, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=155s">00:02:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">again, I didn't actually own them. I had to go to the library, and then I had to get all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=162s">00:02:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these, and stack it up, and get the different commentaries, and then as I'm studying, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=166s">00:02:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question, I would open this up, jot the notes down, and then open the other one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=169s">00:02:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">up, and jot the notes down. All of this stuff is on either online, or how many of you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=177s">00:02:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a Bible program on your computer? Not internet, but Bible program. Okay, a few of you. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=186s">00:03:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have a Bible program, I know that you can go to the internet, but it is so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=190s">00:03:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more easier, because it just goes much faster, and there's so much more that you can access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=198s">00:03:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have about $100, and you want to invest in a material to help you study the Bible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=210s">00:03:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's nothing that will help you more than investing in a Bible program. Now, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=215s">00:03:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have questions about which Bible program, there's one I use, but that's not the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=218s">00:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">popular one, and then there's ones that are used by pastors, and professors, and sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=223s">00:03:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's too complicated, but there's mid-grade ones, right? Especially, how many of you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=227s">00:03:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Mac? Really? How many of you use Mac? Okay, if you use Mac, Accordance is a good one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=239s">00:03:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you could use, but I'm going to, I wanted to bring my computer, but I didn't today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=244s">00:04:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">One of these days, I'm going to show you what I use, and it's very, very basic, but it saves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=250s">00:04:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">me a ton of time. I wanted to introduce to you two reference books. One is Divine Complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=256s">00:04:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Expository Dictionary, right? So, years ago, they put together a reference book, where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=265s">00:04:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">basically with definitions of all the words, key words that are used in the Bible, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=270s">00:04:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they put definitions on it, and it's linked to a strong number, so they have a number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=275s">00:04:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for every single word that is used in the Bible, and then if you look up that number,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=279s">00:04:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll give you the definition of that, where that word is used, how many times it's used,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=284s">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and how they understood it, in what context, okay? So, this is the book for that, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=290s">00:04:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">has been around for a long time, but a lot of people who study the Bible on a regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=295s">00:04:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">basis, this is what they reference, okay? So, this is one of them, the Vines Dictionary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=301s">00:05:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay? Again, you can get one of these, and have it in your library, and carry it around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=306s">00:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in your backpack, and open it up, and go to do that, but if you have a Bible program,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=311s">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all you have to do is just download this onto the Bible program, right? It's like 15 bucks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=316s">00:05:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">20 bucks, and then whenever you have a question on a word, you just click it, and this will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=320s">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">come up, okay? The other one, this is probably what I use on a week-to-week basis more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=327s">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">any other reference book. Every sermon, every Bible study, every time I study the Bible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=333s">00:05:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I reference this, and basically what this is, is gives you key cross-references, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=339s">00:05:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that most of your Bibles have something in the middle, and let's say if you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=344s">00:05:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really important verse, and it'll give you like one or two verses that are related to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=348s">00:05:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that verse, this goes through, like let's say if you were looking at John 3, 16, "For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=356s">00:05:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">God so loved the world," so, you know, where in other parts of the Bible is that phrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=361s">00:06:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">used, "God and love," and it'll give you all the references where God's love is mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=367s">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Bible. Now, do you think that would be useful? Extremely useful, right? And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=373s">00:06:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of just giving you two verses, or one or two verses for the verse, it'll break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=377s">00:06:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">down every phrase, every thought, and it'll list down all the verses, okay? It's not 100%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=385s">00:06:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">complete, but it's thorough enough where if you are seriously studying the Bible, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=390s">00:06:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to help you tremendously, okay? So, this, again, if you bought this and you carry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=397s">00:06:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this around, imagine carrying this thing around every time you study the Bible, but if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=400s">00:06:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have a good Bible program, all you have to do is purchase this and download it, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=404s">00:06:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, it's half the cost of annual Disneyland Pass, so if you invest in this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=412s">00:06:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right, in the Bible program, you can easily download it and have eternal value instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=416s">00:06:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of earthly things, okay? So, seek eternal things instead of the earthly things, all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=422s">00:07:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, this is the Vines, this is the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Treasury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=432s">00:07:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of Scripture Knowledge, okay? Revise and expand it. I didn't know, but Esther told me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=442s">00:07:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">she was listening to MacArthur, and MacArthur said that this is one reference book that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=445s">00:07:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">he uses more than any other reference book, okay? If that helps. I don't care what Pastor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=453s">00:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Peter says, okay? But John McIler said it, so, okay? All right, so again, this would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=461s">00:07:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be tremendously helpful. If you're digging and you really want to study the Bible, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=466s">00:07:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is highly recommended. It'll take your Bible study to another level, okay? I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=474s">00:07:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to leave it up here. If you want to, like, jot it down or take a picture of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=477s">00:07:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it, okay, for reference, I'll leave it up here. Okay. All right, so let's look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=487s">00:08:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">text. Remember, the very first thing that we do every week is to, is for sentence structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=493s">00:08:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">outline, right? If you look at it, what are the key words or phrases or ideas that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=501s">00:08:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated in this text? Okay, things above. I actually highlighted it for you. I highlighted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=514s">00:08:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it and I was going to de-highlight it and I forgot, okay? Christ. How'd you get that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=523s">00:08:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so Christ is the ongoing theme. Obviously, the whole New Testament, Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=528s">00:08:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is the ongoing theme, but in this verse, in these verses, right, the outline, raised with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=536s">00:08:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ, right, to seek where Christ is, we are hidden with Christ, Christ is our life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=547s">00:09:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we will be revealed with Christ, right? So the whole theme or the outline of these four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=554s">00:09:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">verses is about our relationship with Christ and how that determines our life, okay? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=561s">00:09:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the outline of what we're looking at today is, verse one, we are raised with Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=567s">00:09:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Two, seek where Christ is. Three, we are hidden with Christ. Four, our life is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=579s">00:09:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ. Five, we are, we will be revealed with Christ. Okay, so if I was to give a sermon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=585s">00:09:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it'd be a five-point sermon, right, on this. So that's kind of the outline of how we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=591s">00:09:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">going to follow, and the reason why I didn't, all I did was give you the verses, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=595s">00:09:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to put the notes directly into the verses. Instead of, instead of putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=599s">00:09:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the notes on the side, I want you to see where it's coming from. Make circles and then draw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=603s">00:10:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">lines and then say, this is where the insights are coming from, okay? So that when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=608s">00:10:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">studying the Bible, you would do the same thing, okay? All right, so, like I said, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=614s">00:10:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">outline is our relation to Christ and how does that affect what we do. So one is, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=623s">00:10:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you have been raised with Christ, well, even before we get there, he says, therefore, therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=629s">00:10:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is obviously connecting us to the previous verse. And what was the main theme of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=633s">00:10:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">previous passage in chapter two? What was he speaking against? Legalism, right? They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=642s">00:10:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">were all holding on to the Judaistic ways and he says that all of these things have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=649s">00:10:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">no value in what? Taming the flesh, right? So basically he says, don't do this. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=656s">00:10:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how he ended chapter two. And then he says, but do this. So considering that none of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=662s">00:11:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things that you're doing, don't touch, don't eat, don't do this, they have no value in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=667s">00:11:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">absolute, in changing who you are, right? Therefore, do this. And then so basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=673s">00:11:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what he's saying, if you connect what he is saying, these things don't have any power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=677s">00:11:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">over you. So therefore, what? Right? The only power that you're going to have is when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=683s">00:11:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">connected to Christ. You being self-disciplined and saying, I'm not going to do this, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=689s">00:11:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not going to go here, in and of itself, you just, you could be as disciplined as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=694s">00:11:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's no interchange going on. You just happen to be a disciplined person. You just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=698s">00:11:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">happen to be a smart person. You just happen to like to study the Bible. In and of itself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=703s">00:11:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no transformation going on. True transformation happens when we are connected to Christ, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=708s">00:11:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what he's basically saying in chapter three. And he leads us, and that's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=714s">00:11:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the outline. One of the questions that came in is why does he say he was raised with Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=719s">00:11:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Instead of died with Christ. Because the previous chapter, right, mentions it over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=724s">00:12:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and over again that we were crucified with Christ. So you have to see it in the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=727s">00:12:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of the whole letter. So one of the things that I caution you, even though we're only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=732s">00:12:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">studying section at a time, always, always reread what you read before. Okay? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=739s">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to understand it in context. If you don't understand the context, you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=743s">00:12:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to draw out things that he's not talking about. Right? So over and over again, what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=747s">00:12:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">most important thing in interpretation? Context, context, context. So even though we're only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=754s">00:12:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">starting four verses, you have to read how did he get to chapter three, right? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=761s">00:12:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">therefore connects us to everything that he's been saying up to this point. So he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=765s">00:12:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have been raised with Christ, right? Another question came in is why did he say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=769s">00:12:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if, not since? Part of the reason why he says if is because he's challenging this church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=777s">00:12:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that keeps drifting. Right? Because the early church kept on having problems and the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=783s">00:13:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">book of Hebrews about that. People are drifting back to what they know. Self-righteousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=788s">00:13:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So basically he's challenging them. If you've been raised with Christ, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=794s">00:13:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">truly united with Christ, there's no power in that. Right? You need to change your mindset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=801s">00:13:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and seek the things that are above. So he says, if you've been raised with Christ, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=807s">00:13:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the imperative here is keep seeking the things that are above. Right? If you've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=812s">00:13:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">united with Christ. Now, what does it mean to be raised with Christ? Right? We talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=820s">00:13:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">about that in baptism. When you're baptized, you're united with Christ in his death. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=825s">00:13:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's clear what it means to be united with his death. Our old self is dead. Whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=831s">00:13:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ambition that you had, if you had a plan of life and you met Christ, all of that is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=837s">00:13:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be crucified with Christ. And any part of that that we do not crucify is going to continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=842s">00:14:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to cause problems in your life. Right? Any part of your life that you resist the surrender</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=848s">00:14:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to God will over and over and over again in your life is going to be a source of headache</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=853s">00:14:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and problem. Right? Because God is not going to ever, if you are his child, God is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=860s">00:14:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to ever say, you know what? That part of your life, since you're so stubborn, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=866s">00:14:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to let it go. Right? I'm just going to let it go. So that part you can have independence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=872s">00:14:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can do whatever you want, but just give me this. He's king. The whole reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=877s">00:14:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">why the world is under sin and judgment is because of this rebellion. So there's no point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=886s">00:14:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in our Christian life in human history where God's going to just tolerate that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=889s">00:14:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">remember God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if he didn't tolerate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=893s">00:14:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">old Testament, he's not going to tolerate the new Testament. So part of what it means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=897s">00:14:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">before we get, we understand being raised with Christ, that we are crucified with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=902s">00:15:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Then what does it mean to be raised with Christ? Right? And how does that relate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=908s">00:15:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to, how does that relate to what he said in chapter two? Chapter two says, not doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=914s">00:15:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and not touching this and not eating this. They in and of itself has no power to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=918s">00:15:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Right? Therefore, if you've been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=924s">00:15:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does he mean to be raised with Christ? Since there's no power in this, therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=930s">00:15:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you've been raised with Christ, seek the things above. Right? If you take the raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=935s">00:15:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with Christ out, right? You understand what I'm saying? If you take the raised with Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=941s">00:15:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">part out and he says, seek the things that are above. Couldn't that easily be another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=950s">00:15:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">religious thing that they're doing? You understand what I'm saying? Because they're saying, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=956s">00:15:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">not going to do this. I'm not going to eat this. And they want to be righteous and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=960s">00:16:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to, they want to, you know, be righteous by doing things and not doing things. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=965s">00:16:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he says seek the things above, wouldn't that automatically cause us to say, okay, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=968s">00:16:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">should we do? What should we not do? Right? So the key to this passage is with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=977s">00:16:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Since therefore that in and of itself has no power, if you've been raised with Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=981s">00:16:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">seek the things that are above. So the big difference is with Christ. Right? Raised with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=986s">00:16:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ.

To say the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1110s">00:18:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right things, to do the right things. But there's no interchange going on. So he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1116s">00:18:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"Seek." Right?

Right? So God has given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1172s">00:19:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">us in our union with Christ in his death and resurrection, he has given us the power that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1177s">00:19:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we didn't have before.

In other words, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1241s">00:20:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not seeking Christ.

But how much of our pursuit is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1297s">00:21:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">earthly things in Jesus' name?

So, he says, "If the Holy Spirit's been given to us, the purpose of the Holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1316s">00:21:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit is for us to have the power to seek eternal things, to bring us to God." Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1323s">00:22:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I mentioned before, when the Holy Spirit is groaning, what do you think it's groaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1327s">00:22:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for? It's not groaning for us to have, you know, the best investments and have nice retirement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1334s">00:22:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and get a better job or, you know, have better health.

You should pray, right? But how much of it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1345s">00:22:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that and how much of it is really seeking the things that are above? So, if you've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1349s">00:22:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">raised with Christ, seek the things that are above. Number two, where Christ is seated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1353s">00:22:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at the right hand of God. Right? Set your mind to the things that are above because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1359s">00:22:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where Christ is. We don't think about heaven because if you go to heaven, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1366s">00:22:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get the things that you didn't get here.

And that's what the world thinks heaven is. Right? He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1390s">00:23:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to seek the things that are above because why? Because that's where Christ is. So, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1395s">00:23:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not united with Christ, a non-Christian cannot desire heaven. The heaven he desires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1400s">00:23:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is a heaven that he created in his own mind. It is not a heaven that we know of scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1405s">00:23:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? A non-Christian would never desire heaven. Not the heaven of the Bible because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1412s">00:23:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the primary reason heaven is heaven is because this is where Christ is. Right? So, if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1418s">00:23:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1423s">00:23:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hand. Set your mind on the things that are above. So, when he says set your mind on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1428s">00:23:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are above, typically we think of mind as what? Our intellect. Right? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1436s">00:23:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not how the Bible uses it. In that culture, again, this is why the context is so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1441s">00:24:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why when you get one of these, right? For the low cost of $15.95. Right? If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1450s">00:24:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">get one of these and you look up that word mind, it will give you, like, your intellect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1456s">00:24:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is part of it. But the mind is used in the Bible to refer to the mind, affection, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1463s">00:24:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the will. Right? I mentioned many times in sermons and Bible study, when the Bible talks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1469s">00:24:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about heart, we usually primarily use it to describe what? Emotion. Remember? Those of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1476s">00:24:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys who pay attention during sermons. Right? When the Bible talks about heart, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1481s">00:24:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is that in reference to? It's not just emotions. Huh? Volition. Yeah, part of it. Okay, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1494s">00:24:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">part of it. Basically, when the Bible talks about heart, it's in reference to your whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1499s">00:24:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">being. All of you. It's equivalent to for us to saying, like, put your soul into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1506s">00:25:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? The essence of who you are. So it's not just limited to heart. So volition, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1511s">00:25:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously is included in that. So in the Bible, it's kind of reversed. Because when he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1518s">00:25:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mind, it encompasses the idea of affection. And not just intellect. Right? So when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1525s">00:25:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">understand that, think about Romans chapter 12 too. Do not be conformed to this world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1532s">00:25:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but be transformed by what? Reading of your mind. So if you understand the word mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1538s">00:25:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in our context, you only think that God is trying to get you to think differently. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1546s">00:25:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Not to conform to this world, but to change your thinking. That is not how the word mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1552s">00:25:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is understood. The word mind there is not just talking about thinking, but your affection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1557s">00:25:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and your will. All of that is included in Romans chapter 12. So you can have good thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1564s">00:26:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and poor affection and still be like the world. Right? So when God is calling us to be transformed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1573s">00:26:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">he's not only calling us to be transformed in the way that we think. He's causing us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1578s">00:26:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to transform in the things that we have affection for. Right? So that's why he says, if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1586s">00:26:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">been raised to Christ, seek the things that are above. Because this is where Christ is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1589s">00:26:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at the right hand of God. Set your mind, your affection, your will, on the things that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1594s">00:26:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">above and not on the things that are on earth. Okay? To your whole being. He's not just thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1601s">00:26:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about like, hey, just memorize scripture. Why do you memorize scripture? If memorization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1606s">00:26:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of scripture is just keeping it in your head, what will you do with that? Right? You'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1613s">00:26:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">probably catch me when I quote it wrong. Right? When somebody else misquotes it, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1620s">00:27:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not the right way to say that. Right? The purpose of Bible memorization is for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1626s">00:27:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of what? Meditating. Right? Allow the word of God in your mind to meditate on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1632s">00:27:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Right? So that you would not turn from it to the left or to the right. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1635s">00:27:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of Bible memorization. It's not just so that your mind would be fresh. Right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1643s">00:27:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thirdly, for you have died and your life is now hidden with Christ. You notice here that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1650s">00:27:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he doesn't say hidden in Christ. What is the difference between being hidden in Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1656s">00:27:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and hidden with Christ? Because it's sometimes when you see prepositions or, or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1666s">00:27:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">certain, certain words, it's not necessarily in the Greek, but this is deliberate. He says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1675s">00:27:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it is, we are not hidden in Christ, but hidden with Christ. So what do you think the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1681s">00:28:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with the, the meaning between the two? Okay. Active participation. When you say hidden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1696s">00:28:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in Christ, with Christ. Okay. Okay. Active and inactive participation. What do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1709s">00:28:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when you say we are hidden in Christ? Is Christ hidden? When you say you're hidden in Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1721s">00:28:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is Christ hidden? Christ is not hidden. Right? Christ is being exalted and you are in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1729s">00:28:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So Christ is being exalted, you stand behind Christ. Right? But that's not what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1736s">00:28:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he says. He says you are hidden with Christ. So when he says you are hidden with Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1743s">00:29:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is Christ hidden too? Christ is hidden too. You see the difference between in and with?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1752s">00:29:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So what does he mean that you are hidden with Christ? What does that mean? Huh? Something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1773s">00:29:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">died? I didn't hear the rest. Huh? We died with him. Okay. Who is Christ hidden to? Not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1786s">00:29:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to us. Right? Those who are perishing. Right? The Bible says the God of this age has blinded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1795s">00:29:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the minds of the unbelievers so that they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1799s">00:29:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ. It is foolishness to them. Right? So why would he say that? Don't seek the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1806s">00:30:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that are above. Seek where Christ is. Where is Christ? He doesn't, again, of course Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1812s">00:30:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is omnipresent, the Lord is with you to the end of the age, but here he says seek the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1817s">00:30:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are above because that's where he is. So as he is hidden, as he is not here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1823s">00:30:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you along with him, right, are hidden with Christ. I think the importance of that, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1835s">00:30:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the hidden with and in is, he's talking about a earthly ambition. Earthly ambition to seek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1843s">00:30:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that are earthly. Right? But Christ, even Christ is hidden. Meaning, Jesus says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1849s">00:30:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not going to know you because they didn't know me. Right? They're not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1853s">00:30:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">honor you because they didn't honor me. And so if you seek honor and glory, right, while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1860s">00:31:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you are united with Christ, you're going the opposite direction. You're not with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1866s">00:31:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are with Christ, you're not going to be glorified by people who don't glorify Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1874s">00:31:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">If people say, "I hate Jesus, but I love you." Right? I think Jesus is a monster, but you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1881s">00:31:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a good person. Right? There's something that went wrong with your life. Right? Either you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1889s">00:31:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not truly united with Christ, but you live in a compromised life. So basically he's saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1895s">00:31:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you seek the things that are on earth and not to seek where God is, Christ, he himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1900s">00:31:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is hidden in this world. He is not honored. Right? So your life, our life is hidden with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1906s">00:31:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ as Christ is hidden to those who are perishing. So if you try to be glorified and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1911s">00:31:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">become somebody in this world outside of Christ, right, you're going the opposite direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1916s">00:31:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How can you be glorified beyond your master? How can you be loved by people who hate our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1922s">00:32:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">master? Right? If I'm married to Esther and somebody just cannot stand her, it's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1931s">00:32:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the other way. Right? If I'm married with her and somebody cannot stand me and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1935s">00:32:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can't stand to be in my presence, they're not going to be able to be with her either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1940s">00:32:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So if we're truly united with Christ, and that's why he says, "If you died with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1949s">00:32:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">him, you have been hidden with Christ." Right? In other words, we are crucified with Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1955s">00:32:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We're hidden with Christ. Number four, so when Christ, who is your life, not life in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1962s">00:32:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this world, but life that is found in Christ, when he appears, what's going to happen? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1970s">00:32:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">will also appear with him in glory. In other words, the glory that you seek in this world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1977s">00:32:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you will only see that when he is glorified, because we're united with him. When he is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1984s">00:33:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">loved, you will be loved. When he is honored, you will be honored. Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1992s">00:33:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how closely united we are with Christ. We are united with him in his death, united</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=1996s">00:33:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with his resurrected life, we have become one. Right? In essence, the Holy Spirit is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2001s">00:33:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in us. The same reason why they hate Jesus will be the same reason why they would hate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2007s">00:33:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">us. So trying to be a cool Christian, right, cool in the eyes of the world, but to be holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2014s">00:33:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the eyes of God is an oxymoron. Right? Whatever they hate about Jesus, they will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2020s">00:33:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hate about us.

You understand what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2030s">00:33:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he is saying? So this seeking of this world, right, desiring glory in this world, to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2038s">00:33:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody in this world, goes contrary to be united with Christ. Right? He said when Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2046s">00:34:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who is your life, is revealed. If you have truly been resurrected with Christ, your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2053s">00:34:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is now in Christ.

Right? So why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2109s">00:35:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">do we come?

But if you've tasted Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2161s">00:36:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Scripture, you can't do anything else. Right? If your eyes have been opened, nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2167s">00:36:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">compares.

Right? Just community, just a place where you belong. That's a huge pool. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2190s">00:36:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where your friend is. That's where your community is. And a lot of people jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2193s">00:36:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">through the hoops and do things that they don't believe just to have a community that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2197s">00:36:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they belong to. Either you're coming to the church for that reason, which a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2203s">00:36:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">do, or you're coming to Christ because you've tasted the goodness of God and nothing can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2209s">00:36:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">replace it. Right? It's one or the other. And so he's saying, "When Christ, who is your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2215s">00:36:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">life, if Christ is your life, don't try to seek life here, because life is not here."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2223s">00:37:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? That's the whole reason why our sins were justified. That's the whole reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2226s">00:37:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to study the Bible. Right? There's nothing I am saying that's so riveting because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2233s">00:37:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it's coming out of my mouth. It's because you've tasted, you've tasted the goodness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2239s">00:37:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of God and you want more. Right? Finally, he says, "Then when he appears, you also will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2247s">00:37:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">be revealed with him in glory." Right? So for now, right, he's not saying like just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2255s">00:37:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">suppress everything.

Don't try to be honored. Don't try because this is not our home. When Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2277s">00:37:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">comes and he is glorified, right, and he is exalted, he is worshipped, he said, "We will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2283s">00:38:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">be glorified with him." Right? Everything that this world tempts us with, everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2289s">00:38:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that we think like, "Oh man, I would just rather have it now." Right? All of that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2294s">00:38:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, "Don't seek the earthly things.

Right? So I'm talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/325582533#t=2337s">00:38:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">those of you who are here who know what I'm talking about.
