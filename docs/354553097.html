kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=163s">00:02:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in the education department really have a relationship with

you that in God's time fruit will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=181s">00:03:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">be born.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=219s">00:03:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have since decided to do our own Bible study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=226s">00:03:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to be doing that in the Philippines on Tuesday nights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=230s">00:03:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just sharing with you what our Bible study looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=235s">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We have praise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=236s">00:03:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We have inductive Bible study discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=239s">00:03:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have a teaching section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=241s">00:04:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And normally if you guys are in your home groups or here on Wednesday, after the teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=245s">00:04:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">session you break up into application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=248s">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">With our teachers, everyone breaks up into departments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=251s">00:04:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And because we're also studying Philippians with your kids, it gives our teachers to contextualize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=256s">00:04:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it and make it the lessons age appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=261s">00:04:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously with seeds, it's hard to do any kind of inductive anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=264s">00:04:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're keeping the seeds as it's been going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=267s">00:04:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, we don't need to touch the curriculum per se for the seeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=274s">00:04:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So but with every other group from kindergarten all the way up to seniors in high school and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=279s">00:04:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even the college ministry, we're all on Philippians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=283s">00:04:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is also added motivation for you guys to review with your children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=289s">00:04:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=290s">00:04:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And every Sunday morning, our teachers are all going to get together in the Sprouts room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=294s">00:04:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and pray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=295s">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Pray for your service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=305s">00:05:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So please, do not hesitate to shoot prayer requests to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=309s">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We will pray for them in the event that you're okay with it being private or public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=316s">00:05:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Philippians curriculum for the youth group and the elementary, the vine and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=321s">00:05:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sprouts, everyone's going to get a worksheet sent home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=326s">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=327s">00:05:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the worksheet is going to usually be about four pages, including discussion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=331s">00:05:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">questions and including study notes and including memory verse.</span></div><div

href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=338s">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the worksheets are tailored toward high school and junior high kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=344s">00:05:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if your first grader gets a worksheet that's made for high school, junior high kids, obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=349s">00:05:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not going to be happy about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/354553097#t=350s">00:05:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reason we're doing that is because I can't make 12 sets of
