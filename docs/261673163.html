class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=99s">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans where he's talking about the ramification of believing in justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=104s">00:01:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">How should justification look like in the life of a Christian?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=108s">00:01:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I know it is a broken record, but for whatever the reason, there has been a heavy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=114s">00:01:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">emphasis on justification, especially in the last maybe about 10 years, and we've benefited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=119s">00:01:59.960</a></span> | <span

every Christian to have a deep understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=126s">00:02:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of justification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=128s">00:02:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But along with the emphasis on justification, there's also been a confusion as to what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=132s">00:02:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it mean to be justified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=135s">00:02:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are some discussions going on, again, in some circles where they think justification</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=142s">00:02:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">should be the only thing that we talked about in the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=146s">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sanctification somehow leads to legalism and burden, where again, it is a false dichotomy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=153s">00:02:33.060</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=158s">00:02:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and as long as we are justified, sanctification may happen or may not happen, it doesn't matter</span></div><div

movement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=174s">00:02:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to nullify sanctification, because it's

people to keep the people in church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=182s">00:03:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's easier to live a life

href="https://www.vimeo.com/261673163#t=191s">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification, basically you have a group of people who are at church who are embracing</span></div><div
