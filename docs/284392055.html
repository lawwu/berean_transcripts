grow until they graduated college</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2672s">00:44:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and they had more time, because they were all --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2673s">00:44:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">even though we were feeding them in the weekend, during the weekday, they were at CCM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2677s">00:44:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and everybody was just doing their own thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2678s">00:44:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they graduated and finally came and committed like fully to the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2683s">00:44:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">was when the church started to bear fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2685s">00:44:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But that took three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2688s">00:44:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Those three years were dry, so dry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2694s">00:44:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I had somebody come up to me after the sermon, and he's like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2699s">00:44:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and with all sincerity, he came to me and he said, "Nothing ever happens at this

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2731s">00:45:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess maybe in the last 10 years, how have you seen your preaching change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2740s">00:45:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">>> You know, I didn't go to a master's seminary where they had a like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2744s">00:45:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, this is how you preach the Bible."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2745s">00:45:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I -- to be honest, I just kind of learned on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2750s">00:45:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way it started was -- it started when I was a youth pastor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2754s">00:45:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because I started preaching topically because that's all I knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2757s">00:45:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I started preaching through the Bible, at least what I thought was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2762s">00:46:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">through the Bible, because I just ran out of material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2766s">00:46:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">To be honest, I ran out of material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2767s">00:46:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">How many times do you talk about lordship and giving and stewardship and discipleship?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2771s">00:46:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And after about 20 sermons, you have to recycle that in a different manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2775s">00:46:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started preaching through John, and then I went to Philippians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2778s">00:46:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so I started preaching, and then I noticed like I enjoyed it much more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2783s">00:46:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because I was actually starting to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2784s">00:46:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I was learning as I was -- so I would say majority of those sermons I probably would throw away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2791s">00:46:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">because I didn't know what I was doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2793s">00:46:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So some sermons sounded like a commentary, because I just took the commentaries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2797s">00:46:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is what it says, and then after a few months of that, I was like, "Oh, this is not working."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2801s">00:46:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like nobody's paying attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2803s">00:46:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so I kind of was adjusting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2806s">00:46:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we first started this church, it's like I was committed to expository preaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2811s">00:46:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but what that looked like in an actual sermon, I just kind of figured out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2815s">00:46:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I probably sound a little bit different, you know, from the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2821s">00:47:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So committed to expository preaching, but how much of the Bible is quoted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2825s">00:47:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">how much of the like the nuances, syntax was quoted in the sermons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2829s">00:47:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that probably changed as it went along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2832s">00:47:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Last 10 years, when you ask the last 10 years, the way it changed was something that I realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2837s">00:47:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that maybe I wasn't doing well was connecting the text to the metanarrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2842s">00:47:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">When I say metanarrative, it's God's redemptive history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2846s">00:47:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So seeing the text, not just in the context of that verse or that letter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2851s">00:47:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but in what God's doing in history, because if you look at it as one letter from Genesis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2856s">00:47:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to Revelation, even if you're studying Ephesians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2860s">00:47:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that Ephesians is a part of the larger letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2861s">00:47:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So where does that fit into redemptive history?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2864s">00:47:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say that's one thing that really kind of like if there was any radical change,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2870s">00:47:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like I realized not that I wasn't thinking that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2872s">00:47:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but maybe I wasn't communicating that enough, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2876s">00:47:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wasn't communicating enough, like how does this connect to the redemptive history?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2880s">00:48:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that have to do with Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2882s">00:48:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I made a deliberate decision to make an effort to connect to that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2888s">00:48:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's any change, so if anybody's been here in the preaching in the last 15 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2892s">00:48:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you've probably seen any kind of change, that's probably the change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2896s">00:48:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not how I'm interpreting the passage, but how I'm applying that passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2900s">00:48:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">in the context of the larger message that's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2903s">00:48:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that sense, I probably, you know, that would be a major, it's not a shift,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2907s">00:48:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just a greater effort to connect to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2910s">00:48:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think that's what you're asking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2914s">00:48:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2915s">00:48:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, I'm just totally having a rush on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2918s">00:48:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no. So that was a conscious decision that I made,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2921s">00:48:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's nothing else specifically that I changed other than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2926s">00:48:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was wrestling with this, you know, which is interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2939s">00:48:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because I didn't think about what I did early on in the church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2944s">00:49:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but I decided to, I'm probably going to go into the book of Hebrews,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2949s">00:49:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">mainly because Hebrews is what connects Leviticus to the New Testament.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2954s">00:49:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because we're going to finish up Leviticus, by the time we finish up Leviticus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2958s">00:49:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be done with Romans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2959s">00:49:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Hebrews is going to help connect it all together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2962s">00:49:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And after I made the decision, I was looking back at my sermon notes and see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2967s">00:49:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that's exactly what I did in the early part of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2969s">00:49:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I studied through the Romans and then I jumped through Hebrews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2972s">00:49:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mentioned that today, that Pastor Aaron's first sermon was based upon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2976s">00:49:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, one of the teachings on Melchizedek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2979s">00:49:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, um, it's because that's what I was on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2982s">00:49:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When we finished Romans, I jumped into Hebrews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2984s">00:49:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So my brain is wired the same way as back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/284392055#t=2988s">00:49:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.
