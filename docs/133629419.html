three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=102s">00:01:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to four years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=104s">00:01:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're all, most of them are missionaries, so they're out of the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=109s">00:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was the first time in ten years that all of us were in one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=114s">00:01:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's typically one would come in and the other one would not be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=118s">00:01:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've had meetings throughout the years, like, you know, two of us or three of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=121s">00:02:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the first time where all of us got together and was able to have fellowship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=125s">00:02:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a great time

of one, they were all ten, eleven years older</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=133s">00:02:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">than I was when I was younger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=134s">00:02:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember when I was back in college, they would talk about things that I had no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=138s">00:02:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">idea what they were talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=139s">00:02:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they were ten years older, so they were talking about their parents retiring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=142s">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and how they're going to take care of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=144s">00:02:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously my parents were not at that stage yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=147s">00:02:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I always felt a little bit, you know, out of place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=151s">00:02:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it was a reminder, you know, yes, that this Monday when we got together and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=156s">00:02:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking, and I was, the topic of the conversation was Alzheimer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=161s">00:02:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they were talking about how you should eat curry because, you know, that prevents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=165s">00:02:45.160</a></span> | <span

at that stage yet, but they're at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=169s">00:02:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of, you know, later 50s and they're hitting their 60s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=172s">00:02:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're not there yet, but they're, the things that they were talking about, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=176s">00:02:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, was a little bit above, above me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=180s">00:03:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was interesting as we were talking about that and how, you know, that issue is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=185s">00:03:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">very real because some of their parents already have, have dementia setting in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=189s">00:03:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe some of your parents or grandparents have experienced that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=193s">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea of losing your memory, somebody that you knew all your life and all of a sudden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=197s">00:03:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't remember you or they don't even remember themselves and how heartbreaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=201s">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that must be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=202s">00:03:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, our ability to be able to understand who we are and be able to recognize our surrounding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=208s">00:03:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's our life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=209s">00:03:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how we function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=210s">00:03:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, our, basically our life is an accumulation of the things that we've experienced and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=216s">00:03:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">made you who you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=218s">00:03:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the way you relate to people who's around you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=221s">00:03:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So your identity is extremely important for our life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=224s">00:03:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's at the core of who we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=226s">00:03:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">As Christians, again, it's extremely important for us to recognize and understand who we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=231s">00:03:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are in our identity because the moment we forget that, we begin to drift out into what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=236s">00:03:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest of the world is, you know, because we're social beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=240s">00:04:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a tendency that whoever we're surrounded with, whatever social environments that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=245s">00:04:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">surrounded with, we have a tendency to just kind of adapt and adopt to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=249s">00:04:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're maybe younger in college and we're surrounded by Christian friends 24/7, we may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=255s">00:04:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just kind of go along with the flow and then our identity is solidified by the campus ministry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=260s">00:04:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or the church or events or small groups that we belong to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=263s">00:04:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But once you graduate college and your identity is very difficult to find in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=270s">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, our identity is completely contrary and opposite of what we see around us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=275s">00:04:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So the moment that we forget who we are, we naturally drift to become what the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=282s">00:04:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the world is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=284s">00:04:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I say all of this is because the passage that we're looking at, Paul is introducing himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=289s">00:04:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Roman church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=291s">00:04:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And before he gets to the heart of the message and he's going into what we talked about last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=295s">00:04:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">week where he's going through systematically through the gospel, he introduces himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=301s">00:05:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because he's never been at this church and he's saying, "Before I speak, I want you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=306s">00:05:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">know this is who I am."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=307s">00:05:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So this morning, we're going to be unpacking three things that he says of his identity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=312s">00:05:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and take some time to study and look into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=316s">00:05:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what does that say about us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=319s">00:05:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing that we see is Paul's identity in relation to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=325s">00:05:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul's identity in relation to Christ.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=331s">00:05:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it's Paul's identity in relation to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=334s">00:05:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Third, Paul's identity in relation to his work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=339s">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one, Paul's identity in relation to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/133629419#t=341s">00:05:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, Paul's identity in relation to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
