There in the light of every sunrise. There in the shadows of this life. Your great grace. It's there on the mountain top. There in the everyday and the mundane. There in the sorrow and the dancing. Your great grace. Oh, such grace. From the creation to the cross. There from the cross into eternity. Your grace finds me. Yes, your grace finds me.  It's there on the wedding day. There in the weeping by the graveside. There in the very breath we breathe. Your great grace. The same for the rich and poor. The same for the sane and for the silly. Enough for this whole wide world. Your great grace. Oh, such grace. From the creation to the cross. There from the cross into eternity. Your grace finds me. Yes, your grace finds me. There in the darkest night of the soul. There in the sweetest of dreams. There in the sweetest songs of victory. Your grace finds me. Yes, your grace finds me. Your great grace. Oh, such grace. Your great grace. Oh, such grace.  The same for the rich and poor. The same for the sane and for the silly. Enough for this whole wide world. Your great grace. Oh, such grace.  So I'm breathing in your grace. I'm breathing out your praise. I'm breathing in your grace. Forever I will be. I'm breathing in your grace. I'm breathing out your praise. I'm breathing in your grace. Forever I will be. I'm breathing in your grace. I'm breathing out your praise. I'm breathing in your grace. Forever I will be. I'm breathing in your grace. I'm breathing out your praise. I'm breathing in your grace. Forever, forever. It's the same for the sane and the silly.  It's enough for this whole wide world.  Your grace finds me. Yes, your grace finds me.</p></div></body></html>
