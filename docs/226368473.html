there's measuring going on for the purpose of not revealing sin, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=123s">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span

measuring again in the book of Revelation in much more detail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=131s">00:02:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when it's talking about the new Jerusalem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=135s">00:02:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to have an

of Revelation, in particular chapter 21, is that is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=145s">00:02:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a description of heaven or is that a description of the millennial kingdom?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=149s">00:02:29.280</a></span> | <span

you interpret that is going to have a huge effect on how you see the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=155s">00:02:35.520</a></span> | <span

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=158s">00:02:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is measured in detail in chapter 21.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=165s">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But what is the meaning of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=166s">00:02:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Why does God in this text ask John to take measurements of the temple, the detailed measurement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=173s">00:02:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the temple, and tell him not to measure the outer court?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=175s">00:02:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the purpose of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=177s">00:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we see a similar thing that happens in Ezekiel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=182s">00:03:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I have a, yeah, Ezekiel 43, 6, 3, 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span

heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=192s">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">one speaking to me out of the temple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=193s">00:03:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said to me, 'Son of man, this is the place of the throne and the place of the soles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=197s">00:03:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=201s">00:03:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=205s">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places.'"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=208s">00:03:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to keep reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=210s">00:03:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, after he reminds the nation of Israel that the temple is God's house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=218s">00:03:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he says, "You've been defiling my house by disobeying and going after other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=224s">00:03:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">idols," and then he tells him in the next passage to go take all these measurements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=228s">00:03:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of the temple, of all the different articles, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=231s">00:03:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it kind of correlates with what he's doing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=235s">00:03:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So why would you ever take measurements of your house?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=241s">00:04:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, those of you guys who have your own house or your condo, when would you take measurements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=249s">00:04:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of your house?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=250s">00:04:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to tell your friends how big your house is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=254s">00:04:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">When do you take measurements of your house?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=258s">00:04:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You're remodeling, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=260s">00:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Rebuilding, it's for the purpose of building or modeling, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=264s">00:04:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the imagery that we see of God telling them to take measurements, it's not that God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=270s">00:04:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is remodeling, but it is to signify his presence, that he's restoring the temple, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=278s">00:04:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He's restoring the

restoration of God's presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=284s">00:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in Israel, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=286s">00:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what he's saying, remember, where are we in the seven-year tribulation right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=290s">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=302s">00:05:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Three and a half years into it, and he says, remember, time, times, and a half of times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=307s">00:05:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three and a half years, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=310s">00:05:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's right at the half mark, and up to this point, up to this point, God says he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=316s">00:05:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to bring judgment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.vimeo.com/226368473#t=319s">00:05:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That he was not going to delay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
